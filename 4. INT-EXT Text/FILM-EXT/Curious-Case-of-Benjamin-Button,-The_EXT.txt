And we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting
ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new
TRAIN STATION...
DAISY
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The
finest clockmaker in all of the
South built that clock...
3
7
An old wooden barn of a building. Their son, hugging his
parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other
soldiers, pulling away... Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his
hat goodbye to his son...
DAISY'S (V.O.)
Oh how he worked, for months he
did nothing but work on the clock
for the great train station.
8
9
We see "Mr. Cake" in his familiar hat, his wife holding
his arm, standing among the rows of coffins.
DAISY'S (V.O.)
They buried him where the Gateau
family had been buried for a
hundred and seven years...
10
10
An old New Orleans cemetery, vines crawling the
sepulchers.
DAISY'S (V.O.)
Mr. Cake went back to work on his
clock... laboring to finish...
11
13
And we see just that... bullets leaving mens' wounds
sailing back into the rifles from whence they came...
limbs, whole again... cannon balls rocketing backwards
into the cannons' breech... Fallen come to their feet, to
live and breathe again.
MONSIEUR GATEAU (V.O.)
... home to farm, to work, have
children, to live long, full
lives...
14
15
And we see his own son, Martin, once again full of life
hopping backward off the train to land where his journey
started... back in the arms of his loving parents...
7.
16
17
Mr. Gateau, blindly rowing... away...
18
19
THERE'S SUDDENLY AN EXPLOSION OF FIREWORKS.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
The war to end all wars had ended.
We see the streets of New Orleans are filled with
drunken, singing revelers... cars jamming the
cobblestones, people kissing, shouting joyful... Another
burst of fireworks.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I was told it was an especially
good night to be born...
(CONTINUED)
9A.

CONTINUED:
19
And we see in the fireworks' light, a young MAN in his
early 30s, THOMAS BUTTON, running up to the gate of a
fashionable town home. He nearly collides with a PRIEST
who arrives there at the same time. Thomas runs past
him, up the steps...
20
22
... Thomas, tears on his face, carrying his CRYING BABY,
through the streets... Pushing through crowds...
23
23
... he comes along an old bridge over a waterway... the
air heavy with the haze of fireworks... the water dark...
brokenhearted, he lifts the baby to throw it into the
black water... He is just at the apex of this throw when,
despite his sadness, he can't bring himself to do it...
Instead, cradles the newborn...
THOMAS
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
A LANTERN lights his face... A POLICEMAN down the way...
POLICEMAN
What are you doing there!?
The BABY starts to CRY...
POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
What do you have there?
Thomas takes off... the Policeman after him... Thomas,
carrying the CRYING BABY, running...
12.
23A
23A
Thomas, scuttling with the crying infant through narrow
streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the
large old moldering antebellum houses...
24
24
He comes to an old three-story house with a screened
porch, VOICES from inside... PEOPLE TALKING and
LAUGHING... The Baby, soothed by the soft yellow light,
by the music of the voices, by the house itself -- stops
its mournful cry. Thomas stops, catching his breath...
He looks in through the back porch... the sounds of
VOICES coming... Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back
porch steps. He takes out every last dollar he has,
tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket... We can
just see the figures of two people coming from inside...
Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door... And his
decision made, he turns, moving away from the house,
leaving his child behind.
A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
I could've sworn I heard somebody
knockin'...
When a young Black Woman, in a green dress, comes onto
the porch... A thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s,
with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- She's known as
QUEENIE. She's followed by a handsome Black man, MR.
WEATHERS -- that everyone calls TIZZY. She looks out the
door, and not seeing anything...
QUEENIE
I guess not...
She stands for a moment taking in the night air...
QUEENIE (CONT'D)
The air smells sweet...
And she sings to herself... a song from the time...
TIZZY
You look very handsome tonight,
Ms. Queenie, handsome as I ever
seen you... The green matches
your eyes...
QUEENIE
(fingering dress)
It isn't everyday a war's over,
Mr. Weathers...

QUEENIE (CONT'D)
We have to mark it somehow... You
ain't no slouch yourself.
He smiles, tips his hat... And they stand in the quiet...
TIZZY
Hambert's back in town... came
home legless, but he home... we're
gonna throw a party for him...
help get himself situated...
(beat)
I know you was sweet on him one
time...
QUEENIE
Sweeter than I shoulda been...
Lost his legs you say? "You never
know what's comin' for you."
And if right on cue an older white Woman sticks her head
out...
OLD WOMAN
Ms. Simone messed herself...
QUEENIE
She got to stop doing that, or
it's diapers for her... I'll be
right there, Mrs. Jameson...
The woman disappears inside.
Queenie, not anxious to
go...
QUEENIE (CONT'D)
It sure is nice out here, Mr.
Weathers...
TIZZY
Awful nice, Ms. Queenie... Come
out back for a moment... take your
mind away from things...
He pushes open the porch screen door...
QUEENIE
(smiles)
Just a moment's time...
He offers her his hand... She takes it... He backs out of
the house, holding her hand, and he suddenly steps right
on top of the Baby... The baby wails, Tizzy stumbles,
nearly falls...
(CONTINUED)
14.
24
CONTINUED: (2)

TIZZY
What in God's name...?!!
QUEENIE
What is that?
A fish crawl out of
the river...?
She moves to it... pushes aside the blanket, and freezes.
QUEENIE (CONT'D)
God in heaven!
IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY. What we
see is the prominent bald head of any newborn... but it
has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an
octogenarian. Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it
would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed
old man...
QUEENIE (CONT'D)
My Goodness, the Lord did
something here...!
TIZZY
Look like a milk wagon run over
it... three times... and back...
And they're both motionless, not quite sure what to do...
TIZZY (CONT'D)
I didn't see it layin' there... I
hope I didn't hurt it none...
steppin' on it like that...
The BABY won't stop its mournful cry...
TIZZY (CONT'D)
We best leave it to the police...
I'll go --
Queenie hesitates... a longing.
QUEENIE
It's for sure nobody wanted to
keep it...
And making up her mind, she suddenly grabs up the crying
baby, taking it inside... Tizzy, anxiously whispering
something, going in after her...
15.
25
34
A line of old people in rockers. Benjamin, like any six-
year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between
them... until one of the oldsters, who has had enough,
sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making
him come to an abrupt stop... Benjamin, sitting with the
other oldsters on the porch... the old people rocking...
Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall... children
playing... people talking...
BENJAMIN BUTTON
What's there?
Nobody says anything, rocking. Benjamin, eternally
curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself
precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall
is lower and he just sees the street... children running
on the street, playing... carriages dropping people off
for a party... He leans forward to get an even better
view... When Queenie suddenly grabs him...
QUEENIE
Benjamin! That's dangerous... Come
back here...!
...Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the
safety of the old people... out of sight of the street...
22.
35
37
And we see the very elderly General Winslow, doing just
that... raising the flag in a downpour, only... he's
naked. And as Queenie comes running across the lawn with
a coat for him. There's the sound of SOMEONE SINGING
OPERA...
BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once a noted
opera singer... well, she'd sing,
Wagner...
38
43
Mrs. Wagner's window open... and not a sound coming
out...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
You could hear when someone left
us... there was a silence in the
house...
44
44
A small funeral at
an old cemetery... And while "DIE
VALKYRIE" PLAYS on
her crank VICTROLA, an old man bangs
cymbals as a grand
finale to the music... while we see
SYBIL WAGNER, laid
to rest to sing in another choir:
45
45
Benjamin with his wondrous ancient face sitting in his
wheelchair with the old people on the porch... watching
the sun go down...
BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
It was a wonderful place to grow
up. I was with people who had put
away all the inconsequences of
life, left in a state of purely
being...wondering about the
weather...the temperature of a
bath...the light at the end of the
day...
And one of them, as if to underscore the point, farts...
46-47A OMIT
46-47A

47B
49
They come outside. Children on the street playing.
Seeing Benjamin, they come to a dead stop... staring at
the freak from the old people's home, with another
freak... Mr. Oti suddenly runs into the street...
NGUNDA OTI
Hurry...
Benjamin tries as best he can to keep up... Mr. Oti darts
directly in front of a street car, waving his arms,
making it come to an abrupt stop...

NGUNDA OTI (OVER) (CONT'D)

country and say he want to talk to
me...

Benjamin, ecstatic, his head out the streetcar window,
Mr. Oti holding onto the back of his breeches from
falling... Benjamin feeling the wind and the city wash
over him...
34.
51
51
Benjamin and Mr. Oti sitting on a bench at the peristyle
of a park. Benjamin takes his first slug of a coca cola,
taking too big a hit, the coke pouring out of his nose...
Mr. Oti gives him a handkerchief... after he's wiped
himself up...
BENJAMIN
Why didn't you go back home?
NGUNDA OTI
War between English and Dutch
people had broken up kingdom.
BENJAMIN
What did you do?
NGUNDA OTI
I leave zoo. Go here. Go there.
Everything okay. But I alone.
BENJAMIN
You were all alone?
NGUNDA OTI
You'll see little man, plenty
times you be alone. You different
like us, it's gonna be that way.
But I tell you a little secret I
find out. We know we alone. Fat
people, skinny people, tall
people, white people... they just
as alone as us... But they scared
shitless...
He smiles a knowing smile...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
Not a thing wrong with being
alone... no sir...
He looks out...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
I think about the river I grew up
on. It would be good to sit by my
river again.
He looks at his watch.
He suddenly gets up...
34A.
52
52
Mr. Oti and Benjamin coming along the street, music
pouring out... They reach a corner where a tall octoroon
woman is waiting. She broadly smiles seeing Mr. Oti.
THE WOMAN
There's my little man. You ready,
sugar.

NGUNDA OTI
(smiles, pure Ngunda)
Always ready. Always ready.

Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.
FILAMENA GILEA
(respectful of his
age)
It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir.
NGUNDA OTI
(to Benjamin)
You can find your own way home,
can't you?
Although he's not sure he can... he nods, yes.
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
The St. Charles Avenue line to
Napoleon...
And with that, his arm around Filamena's waist, the two
of them laughing, walk off... Benjamin's left standing on
the street corner... he looks around to get his
bearings... he moves along Bourbon Street... A streetcar
comes along, bell clanging, it rushes by him... he
watches it go... Clasping his canes, determined, he
starts walking... bent over, one cane after the other...
making his way along the street...
53
53
We see Benjamin coming back to the gate... and we hear:
QUEENIE (V.O.)
Where in God's name have you
been?!!
And we see Queenie standing on the porch... She's worried
sick... she sees his hands are bleeding from blisters.
54
56
The boarders on the lawn with their loved ones... And we
*
see an OLD MAN, walking with the aid of a cane coming out
*
of the house onto the lawn... And as he moves through the
*
people we see it's Benjamin... He has a single cane,
*
standing more upright now, a distinctive shock of white
hair, eyebrows... A distinguished looking man in his
*
seventies, or, in normal years, a growing twelve-year-old
boy...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
It was Thanksgiving 1930, I met
the person who changed my life
forever.
A chauffeured car has stopped... A Man is standing in the
road, looking at the house through the gates... And we
realize it's THOMAS BUTTON... looking for a glimpse of
his son... Benjamin instinctively turns, but it's too
late, his father's back in the car, being driven away...

GRANDMA FULLER

Might I say you are looking

strikingly youthful...a single

drinking?

He laughs...And there's a voice that cuts through the

day...
*
A LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE

Grandma, look at me...

Benjamin, and Grandma Fuller turn to see a little girl,
*
no more than eight, standing on a picnic table top doing

pirouettes, one after another, for an admiring group of

old people...she full curtsies, bowing --the way dancers

do head to chest... then raising her head, laughing...

Now that was really something...

The busy docks... Men waiting, hoping to find work...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
These were hard times... people
were doing anything they could to
find work...
And we see Benjamin, with Mr. Daws, "the lightning man,"
sitting on a bench with a line of other old men, "killing
time," watching the boats going up and down the River...
MR. DAWS
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times? Once,
when I was in a field tending to
my cows.
And we see just that, Mr. Daws, along with a cow of his,
being hit by lightning.
A MAN'S (V.O.)
(shouts)
My fourt' hand didn't show up...
Anybody want to make $2 for a
day's work around here...
Benjamin turns... And he sees a man in his late 40s with
his three man crew, standing on the deck of a TUGBOAT,
and old rusted tug built out of charcoal iron... The man,
its Captain MIKE... Has a thick Irish accent... For some
reason none of the able-bodied men needing work
respond...
CAPT. MIKE
What's wrong, nobody wants to get
their hands dirty...! Nobody wants
to do an honest days work for an
honest day's pay...!
A MAN
(warning them)
He never pays... He always says
he'll have to owe it to you...

CAPT. MIKE
Are all you afraid of workin' for
a livin'? Somebody got to want a

Benjamin suddenly springs up at the opportunity, waving
his arms...
BENJAMIN
I do...!
CAPT. MIKE
You got your sea legs old man?
BENJAMIN
(feeling his legs)
I do. I think.
CAPT. MIKE
That's good enough for me! Get
your ass on board, we'll sure as
hell find out!
And as Benjamin gets on the boat, heading out to sea...
72
72
And we see Benjamin "learning the ropes..." Helping to
tow the freighters, into and out of the River ports...
Benjamin in this element, like a boy, his hair blowing,
thrilled to be on the boat, thrilled by the adventure...
willing to do anything...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
I was as happy as I could be... I
would do anything...
CAPT. MIKE
I needs a volunteah.
BENJAMIN
Yes, Captain!
CAPT. MIKE
(motioning)
Scrape off this bird shit.
BENJAMIN
Right away, sir...!
And he hops to it... Happily scraping off the bird
shit... Happy to be doing anything...

BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
And I actually was going to be
paid for something I would have

BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
His name was Captain Mike Clark...
He'd been on boats since he was
seven...
73
79
It's a rainy night. Benjamin, feeling like a million
bucks, walks along the street, going home... A
chauffeured car pulls alongside him, the window rolled
down... And we see Thomas Button in the car...
THOMAS BUTTON
It's awful wet out. Can I offer
you a ride somewhere...?
BENJAMIN
That's very kind of you, Sir.
He gets into the car.
80
83
The car's stopped outside the gate... Benjamin is
drunkenly getting out...
THOMAS BUTTON
I enjoyed talking to you...
BENJAMIN
I enjoyed drinking with you...
He starts to wobble inside...
THOMAS BUTTON
(after him)
Benjamin...
Benjamin slows...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
Would you mind, if time to time, I
stopped by to say hello...?
BENJAMIN
(a drunken wave)
Anytime.
THOMAS BUTTON
(happily)
Goodnight, Benjamin.
BENJAMIN
(drunkenly)
Absolutely... Mr. Button...
Benjamin turns inside. Thomas looks after him for a long
moment... And then he drives away...
84
85
The family's on the lawn...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
I loved the weekends when she
would come and spend the night
with her grandmother.
86

Benjamin, in an old peacoat, holding another -- waits...

going quickly down the street...

Fog. The first light of dawn. A full compliment of
boats tied up for the night... They scamper along the
dock... to the "Chelsea" ...Benjamin helps her climb
aboard...
89
90
The tugboat making its way through the fog... Benjamin
standing with Daisy on the prow... the wind in their
faces... And suddenly out of the fog a HORN BLARES... As
loud as anything they have ever heard... and moving out
of the mist, horn still echoing, a huge ocean liner
appears... With three other tugboats pushing it to sea...
CAPT. MIKE
She put in for repair... a wounded
duck... She's flyin' now...
Captain Mike joins the tugs at the liner's side... the
tugs sounding horns of their own... a symphony of a
kind... What interests Benjamin...
BENJAMIN
What does it take to build
something like that?
Passengers line the railing... continuing their
adventure... And what interests Daisy...
DAISY
Imagine all the places they're
going to see...
Daisy, thrilled, waves to them -- the passengers along
the rail, waving back... Benjamin stands by Daisy, their
hair blowing in the salty air....
DAISY (CONT'D)
(to Benjamin)
I wish we could go with them...
As they watch the liner, like a foggy dream, sailing
away...
66.

94
We see an old New Orleans paupers' cemetery... Benjamin
and the mourners, and because he can't remember her name,
around an unmarked grave...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
She had taught me how to play the
piano.
As Benjamin watches the woman go to her final rest.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And she taught me what it meant to
miss somebody.
95
97
We see TIZZY on the porch holding Benjamin's suitcase for
him... The woman's old dog lying beside him...
TIZZY
(shaking his hand)
Good luck, son.
And we see Queenie has come out onto the porch with her
little girl... and he holds Queenie... tears running down
her face...
BENJAMIN
Goodbye, Mother...
He bends to pet the old dog goodbye... He takes up his
suitcase and starts off the porch... going down the
walkway... he hesitates, and opens the gate... moving out
onto the street... When suddenly Daisy is calling him...
DAISY
Benjamin... Benjamin...
She comes running.
He stops to let her catch up to
him...
DAISY (CONT'D)
Where are you going?
BENJAMIN
To sea.
I'll send you a postcard.
DAISY
From everywhere. Write me a
postcard from everywhere...
And with so much she wants to say, she can't say
anything. So she runs away... He watches her go,
watchers her thin legs running back down the street...
and he turns and moves off along the street...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
And I went off to sea...
We see him in the distance, the "old man", a 17 year old,
suitcase in hand, going to find out who he is and what he
is to become...

The Tugboat, in the distance, steaming through the
ocean...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

three years with Moran Brothers
Tug and Salvage... The old ship

Atlantic seaboard...

Well Captain, you do drink a
lot...
And that makes perfect sense to Mike...

night, they walk through the sleeping Russian town, their
shadows in the moonlight. They stop to share a drink from
the champagne bottle. They laugh.
BENJAMIN
I feel so much younger when I'm
with you...
And it seems he's about to go on... But Elizabeth,
flattered, takes it metaphorically...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT
That's such a nice thing to say.
You make me feel years younger,
too. I wish I was. I would
change so many things. I would
undo all of my mistakes.
BENJAMIN
What mistakes?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT
I kept waiting, thinking I would
do something to change my
circumstance... Do something...
But I never did... It's an awful
waste, you can never get it
back... wasted time...
They're quiet.
She looks at him.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
(abruptly)
If we're going to have an affair,
you're never to look at me during
the day, we must always part by
sunrise, and we can never say "I
love you..."
He's quiet...

ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
And when it is over I will send
you a card that will simply say
goodbye... Those are the rules...
They stand in the cold. His answer is...
BENJAMIN
Are you as cold as I am?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT
(laughs)
My god, colder.
They stop to finish what's left of the champagne,
Elizabeth hurling the bottle. The bottle falling silently
into some fresh snow.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
You can't even break a bottle
here.
They look at each other and they kiss. And without
anything else needing to be said, they start back...

The men on the tug on a dark gray sea....
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
It wasn't the war we expected. We
would tow crippled ships... scraps
of metal...

BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
across the high seas... If there
was a war, we didn't see it...
And what seemed exciting, the idea of war... is
tedious... The "Chelsea" towing a strange hulking shape
on the dark, empty sea...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
There was a man assigned with
us... The Chief Gunner loved the
Navy, and most of all, he loved
America.
THE MAN'S (V.O.)
There is no other country in the
world...! When YOU spell America,
A.M.E.R.I.C.A. You're spelling
freedom...!
We see the young Gunnery Mate, no more than nineteen...
sitting at his post on a high caliber machine gun...
ready to kick some enemy ass...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
His name was Dennis Smith and he
was a full blooded Cherokee... His
family had been in America for
over five hundred years.
DENNIS SMITH
You have these pacifists. They
say they won't fight on
conscience. Where would we be if
everybody decided to act according
to their conscience?
CAPT. MIKE
(out his Window)
Keeps it down, would you chief!
He goes back inside... And as they settle into their
tasks..
DENNIS SMITH
(on his gun, to
himself, the last
word)
Where else can you shoot white
people and get away with it...
Benjamin's the only one around to hear him...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
I worked in the kitchen...
93.
141
143
We see "Chelsea," a steel tow line splayed out from its
winch, towing a large crippled freighter across the
ocean...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
We were towing a British
freighter, that had gone dead in
the water, 800 miles to Halifax
for repair...
We see Benjamin and the crew watching the ship on the tow
line run out some thousand feet behind them...
144
145
Captain Mike stands by the wheelhouse... silently looking
at the ocean... They see bodies of men, dead men,
floating by them... One and two at first... then three
and four... and then more and more until they are moving
through a carpet of bodies...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
The war found us.
As they move through the water... their propeller
literally chopping up bodies, to where they have to
veritably shut their engines down...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
A transport carrying 900 men had
been hit by a torpedo. We were
first to arrive at the scene...
And as the tug arrives at the scene we see a TRANSPORT
VESSEL, with a gaping hole in its midships sinking
quickly... Fuel oil burning on the water...
(CONTINUED)
95.
145
CONTINUED:
145
It's then we see the true horror of the men in the
water... in the burning black oil... The transport boat
silently slips into the water, disappearing under the
sea...
146
146
As the tug moves through the thick black smoke...
Benjamin and the other crewmen watching along the
rails...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
There wasn't a sound...
Except for the
lapping of water, and the tugboat's
engines, there
isn't... just the silence of death...
Something else
appears, doming onto the surface like a
spectre... the
U-BOAT that had reeked this havoc...
looking to see
the results... Captain Mike sees the
sub...
CAPT. MIKE
(mad as hell)
We can't run from the fucker and
we can't hide...! There's only one
thing we can do...!
(and he shouts)
Battle Stations...!!!
They run to their battle stations...
147
148
A German submariner, on the conning tower, seeing the
Tugboat, turns the .50 caliber machine gun on the
tugboat... Benjamin is grazed by a bullet, his forehead
cut open, bleeding... Despite the strafing the tug is
relentless... The submarine, seeing it is about to be
rammed tries to dive... but it's too late... the tugboat
ramming the submarine... severing the U-Boat in half. The
concussion of the collision has triggered a torpedo in
the sinking submarine's torpedo shaft, the torpedo
exploding, bursting the submarine, and in the process,
blasting away under the stern of the tugboat... the men
on the stern blown to pieces... Benjamin's literally
thrown against the wheel house... He manages to get to
his feet, the tug listing, beginning to sink... There's a
man's voice...
(CONTINUED)
96.
148
CONTINUED:
148
And he sees, Captain Mike riddled with bullets, his body
covered with blood... Benjamin bends to him... Captain
Mike trembling as he lays dying...
CAPT. MIKE
Look at what they did! They shot
holes in me! They shots the hell
out my paintin'!
His body, his tattoos, like a ripped canvas, is
riddled...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
You've seen a lot of things. Tell
me it's going to be alright.
BENJAMIN
You're going to heaven Captain
Mike. You're going to heaven.
Benjamin sits beside him, his friend Captain Mike, dying.
And a light comes in Captain Mike's eyes... an
understanding.
CAPT. MIKE
You can be mad as a mad dawg at
the way things wents... You can
swear, curse the fates, regret
every'ting you ever dids... but
when it comes to the end... You
have to lets go...
He looks in Benjamin's old eyes....
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
Give me a hand, old man...
And as he holds Benjamin's hand ready to meet his
maker...
149
149
There are two destroyers and a hospital ship in the
battle zone flow... Planes circling... The water still
speckled with debris, and bodies...

We see Benjamin at the railing of a Liberty Ship.. He
watches the "Chelsea" sink, disappearing under the sea...

BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
736 men died that day... I said my
goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis
Smith, John Grimm who was right,
he was going to die there... I
sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his
money... I said goodbye to the
twin, Vic Brody...
He instinctively turns, and sees Rick Brody looking out a
porthole, lost without his twin brother...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And to Mike Clark... Captain of
the tugboat "Chelsea."
A storage cabinet is opened, a sailor taking out a
wreath, from a supply of just such wreaths...
BENJAMIN
You mind...
The Sailor shrugs, giving him the wreath...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
I said goodbye to all the other
men... who had dreams of their
own... All the men who wanted to
be plumbers or singers or
insurance salesmen or doctors...
or lawyers or Indian chiefs.
And suddenly, angrily, he throws the wreath into the
water...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Out here, death didn't seem
normal.
Benjamin standing at the rail of the ship... no longer a
boy... And a SAILOR standing beside him....
THE SAILOR
This don't get fixed...
Benjamin's quiet. When suddenly a HUMMINGBIRD comes
flying across the water... It circles the wreath, the way
Hummingbirds do... and then flies off...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
...I'd never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea before...

And as Benjamin stands at the railing, looking at the
sea...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
In the spring of 1945.... when I
was 26 years old... I went home...
151
151
We see Benjamin, suitcase in hand, going up the walk to
the old house. We're struck by the difference... the old
man who had left to see the world has returned a
strikingly handsome man in his fifties. The old blind
dog, smelling ham, ambles off the porch to meet him.
Nothing seems to have changed. An old woman we don't
know is rocking on the porch. A black girl, just 14... is
hanging out wash...
BENJAMIN
Is your mother home?
THE GIRL
She's gettin' supper ready....
He goes up the porch, inside....
152
153
Benjamin sitting with a row of oldsters. And feeling out
of place, out of time, he gets up and goes inside.
154
160
...And we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion...
and Daisy, dressed for the night, glides out... a man
helping her... and we see Benjamin a step behind getting
out of the car... dressed to the nines... hair slicked,
elegant... but nonetheless, a step behind... And we hear
Daisy's voice, from somewhere else...
DAISY'S (V.0.)
...I danced for a man named
Ballenchine...He's a famous
choreographer. He said I had a
perfect line. They asked
Ballenchine to describe what he
did. He said, "I'm a carpenter."
Isn't that amazing? In one of his
rehearsals a dancer fell. He put
it into the production. Can you
imagine that in a classical
ballet? A dancer intentionally
falling? He isn't the only one,
Agnes DeMille, Lincoln Kirstein,
Richard Pleasant, Lucia
Chase...There's a whole new word
for dance now, it's called
abstract..."
The door to the restaurant held open for Daisy... another
man showing her inside... Benjamin forgotten for the
slightest of moments at the door... going after her.
106.
161
162
We see Benjamin and Daisy, their silhouettes walking
through the park... She puts her arm around his
shoulder... being close to him...
DAISY
I have to go back tomorrow... I
wish I could stay...
They reach a GAZEBO... Not a soul around... They stand
for a moment in the silence...
DAISY (CONT'D)
In New York we stay up all
night... I eat breakfast in a
diner on Houston with red booths
and watch the sun come up over the
buildings... there's always
something to do...
Which is in stark contrast to Benjamin's life... Daisy,
takes off her shoes...
DAISY (CONT'D)
Dancers... don't need costumes or
scenery.
And showing him what she's been telling him about, she
does a dance for him...
(CONTINUED)
108.

162
DAISY (CONT'D)
I could imagine dancing completely
naked...
Daisy, dancing for him... While she dances...
DAISY (CONT'D)
Have you read "D.H. Lawrence," his
books were banned... The words are
like making love....
He stands, hands in his pockets appreciating her... she
moves closer to him... She comes next to him and she
kisses him... and when he doesn't respond... she tries a
different tact...
DAISY (CONT'D)
In our group... you have to trust
people... not be afraid... Sex...
is a big part of it... A lot of
the dancers... are lesbians... A
woman wanted me to sleep with
her....
He's quiet.
DAISY (CONT'D)
Does that upset you?
BENJAMIN
Which part?
DAISY
That someone wanted to sleep with
me.
BENJAMIN
People should want to sleep with
you... You're very desirable...
DAISY
Let's go back to the house... or
get a room somewhere... we can put
down your coat...
She takes his hand, as if to lead him to the dark of the
park... There's nothing he'd like more... but...
BENJAMIN
It's not that I don't want to... I
just can't... not tonight....Its
just not...
(CONTINUED)

DAISY
I'm old enough.
And despite how available she is, how desirable she is...
BENJAMIN
Go back to New York, Daisy... Be
with the people you are so fond
of... You can only be young
once...
DAISY
Do you think you are too old for
me... I've been with older men...
And when he still doesn't respond...
Daisy, rejected,
takes up her shoes... And she starts
off... Benjamin
coming beside her... but they're not
really walking
together anymore... and the time for
them, this time, has
gone away...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
You only get so many chances to be
with someone... I let her go...
and I missed it...
163
166
An old brick building with a painting on its side of a
woman sewing on a button... "Button's Buttons." A driver
waits outside of a "town car".

We see Benjamin being let in by a Butler into the
fashionable home.
173
174
We see Benjamin wheeling his father in a wheelchair out
of the house...And...
175
175
The endless lake. And we see Mr. Button's chauffeured car
driving along the lake.
176
The car's stopped at a chain across the driveway of an
old summer home. Benjamin helps to put Thomas into his
wheelchair. He wheels him up the long drive to the house.

176
All closed up. Shuttered. There are steps that lead down
to the lake. He starts to wheel his father down the
steps. The steps are too steep for the wheelchair.
Benjamin reaches, picking his father up out of the chair.
He carries him down the steps, but that too is arduous...
And he puts his father on his back...His father holding
onto his son, as Benjamin carries him on his back down
the steps to the dock. There's an old wooden deck chair.
He helps his father sit in the chair. And as his father
sits for the last time, watching the lake...
THOMAS BUTTON
Thank you, Benjamin.
Benjamin sitting at a distance behind him...Both of them
watching the day begin...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
You can be mad as a mad dog at the
way things went...You can swear,
curse the fates, regret everything
you ever did... but when it comes
to the end... You have to let
go...
And as his father shuts his eyes, sitting in the sun.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I buried him in the Button family
plot.
177
177
We see Benjamin standing at his father's gravesite in the
family plot, with ornate headstones...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
I had a tailor sew onto his best
coat -- a button for every year of
his life....fifty-five of them...
all different, pearl and silver,
brass and wood... in case he lost
one along the way...
And as he stands at the gravesite... He hears something.
Queenie has come to be with him...to comfort him...
QUEENIE

Don't you suffer alone for it.
She takes his arm, always there for him.

BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
I went to pay a visit to the
button factory.

We see a cab pull up and Benjamin, in a nice suit,
flowers in hand, daisies, gets out, hurrying into The
Majestic Theater, the marquee telling us "CAROUSEL," is
performing.

Benjamin on his way out of the apartment coming along the
street. Daisy running after him...
DAISY
I did what you told me to... enjoy
my life... I'm only going to be
young once... I had no idea you
were coming. What did you think I
was going to do...? You can't
expect me to just drop everything,
Benjamin... this is my life...
And we see DAVID and a group of her dancer friends have
come outside down the way into the street... looking for
cabs...

Benjamin)
Why don't you come with us,
Benjamin... There'll be a lot of
musicians, interesting people
there.... You'll have a good
time...
BENJAMIN
I came here to tell you I made a
mistake before...A day doesn't go
by that I don't regret it...It's
not the way I felt...I should have
never let you go...I came because
I hoped I could be with you...
DAVID
Daisy, you going to come...?
Cabs have pulled up... She's torn... between her life and
some other life... Benjamin, recognizing her conflict...
BENJAMIN
Do you love him?
185

DAISY
I think so. I think I do.
We see the dancers scrambling getting into the taxis...
BENJAMIN

Okay. Okay... I'll see you in New
Orleans...

He turns to go... she's motionless, caught between the
two worlds... And we expect her to yell after him, to
stop him... But instead, she does what we all do in these
moments, what feels good at the time... She runs to be
with her friends... She gets into a taxi... The cab
drives by him as they leave... Daisy turned to look out
the back window... looking back at him... He waves...
letting her go... And another chance for them is
missed... The street's quiet. And hands in his pockets, a
middle-aged man going on 26... he walks off into the
night...
187
188
And we see Daisy, five years older, her arm inside a tall
young blond Russian dancer's, ANITOLY, crossing a snowy
street in Moscow...

A Messenger on a bicycle rides up...
A WESTERN UNION MESSENGER

House...
And we see Benjamin, the wind in his hair, sailing an old
sailboat... And the change in his appearance is
startling... His hair is without a trace of gray... His
face with barely a wrinkle, chiseled...He is a healthy
man in his 40s now...

He comes to the gate, opening it, coming into the yard,
shutting the gate behind him, going up the walkway. An
Old Man is on the porch, quietly rocking. And Queenie,
for some reason is standing just outside the front door
on the porch... an apron in her hands... She nods to
Benjamin... talking to the Old Man in the rocking
chair... but she seems to be watching Benjamin, as he
walks around the house -- to the back door. He takes off
his dirty work boots, leaves them on the porch.

BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
She came back.
They look at each other in silence...and they simply
smile, so glad to see each other after all the missing
years... They embrace...for some time... and kiss... As
people who haven't seen each other, and have thought
about each other... for a very long time... And it just
is...no big symphonies, no endless skies...just, two
people at a kitchen door in the middle of their lives...
and the simplicity, just that, is what makes it real and

people, standing at Queenie's gravesite alongside her
beloved Mr. Weathers. We see Queenie's daughter among
the mourners... in her early 30s herself now... And
Benjamin, standing over his mother's grave... saying his
goodbyes...
BENJAMIN
We are meant to lose the people we

important they are to us.

Is it that my age is starting to

You don't need another child to
raise...

Daisy gets out. The taxi drives off. Daisy stops for a
moment before she opens the gate. The house has fallen
into disrepair. A solitary old man sits on the porch
rocking and rocking. She goes up the walk and out of
habit goes around the back porch... to the kitchen...
going inside...

And we see Benjamin, no more than six now, standing on
the ROOF... Daisy standing on the ground down below
him...
DAISY
(nervous)
I wish you'd come down...
BENJAMIN AT SIX
(a little boy)
I can see everything.
And he points out...
BENJAMIN AT SIX (CONT'D)
I can see the big river... all the
boats... I can see the graveyard
where mama's buried and all those
other people... I can see the
city... where you have your
dancing place...

And tears fill Daisy's eyes...
DAISY
You're right, you can see
everything sweetheart...
And he can... he can see all the way across to the
Mississippi River... the old graveyard... the city... his
whole life...
DAISY (CONT'D)
I think you better come down...
BENJAMIN AT SIX
What if I could fly?
And it looks like he might just try...
DAISY
(stopping him)
I knew a man who could fly. Come
down and I'll tell you all about
him.
He's quiet, thinking about that. And acquiescing, he
turns up the roof out of sight... some short
moments...and he comes running out the front door... his
hands in his pockets like the brave little man he is...
Daisy bends down... and as he runs into her arms... Daisy
holding him...
278
279
And we see Daisy, in her seventies now, carrying a
suitcase, coming up the walkway, and onto the porch...
old people sitting in the porch chairs...
DAISY'S (V.0.)
He was five, I think, when I moved
in... the same age I was when I
had met him...
And we see Benjamin, 5 now, sitting on the porch swing,
staring off... and he drools like a helpless old man.
Daisy stops, taking out a handkerchief, wiping the drool
off his chin...

DAISY
How would you like to help me
unpack?
280
282
And we see Benjamin, just three or so now, holding
Daisy's hand, walking with her in some autumn leaves...
DAISY'S (V.0.)
I watched as he forgot how to
talk...
283

Daisy, sitting on the porch on a rocking chair. Benjamin,
just a baby now, some months old, sleeping in her lap...
DAISY'S (V.0,)
In 2002, they put a new clock on
the train station wall...
286
291
And we see just that... Mr. DAWS being struck by
lightning again...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
"Some are born to sit by a river."
292
292
...And we see just that... Mr. Oti sitting by his
river...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
"Some have an ear for music..."
293
294
...And we see Captain Mike... with his tattoos --
standing on his tug...

BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
"Some know buttons..."
