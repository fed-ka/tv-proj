  And pull out to reveal THE SAME FOUNTAIN, ONLY LARGER.  In 
  the center of an old New England town square, near a sign 
    that says WELCOME TO EASTWICK.  

    Over shots of this quaint little seaside village, with 
    winding cobblestone streets, we hear the lulling, enchanting 
    voice of BUN.

                                BUN (V.O.)
                  From the looks of it, you might say 
                  Eastwick is an everyday kind of 
                  town.  Safe place to grow up, nice 
                  place to take a vacation.  Maybe 
                  even just a little bit boring... 
                  But you d be wrong.  Because if you 
                  look a little deeper, what you ll 
                  find here, is magic...

  We drift toward the perfect Norman Rockwell TOWN SQUARE, 
    where all of Eastwick has gathered for a festive afternoon 
    celebration.  A banner flaps in the breeze above the 
    bandstand, informing us that today is  Eastwick Founders 
    Day.   We float past kids flying kites and parents on picnic 
    blankets, colorful booths selling caramel apples and local 
    handmade crafts.  Don t you wish you lived here?

                                BUN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  Because this town was actually 
                  founded by witches... That s right.  
                  Real, honest to goodness witches. 

  We see some KIDS in PILGRIM COSTUMES playing around a 
    FOUNDERS DAY DISPLAY -- A WOMAN IN A PURITAN-ERA COSTUME TIED 
  TO A STAKE, LAUGHING, AS THE KIDS RUN IN CIRCLES AROUND HER, 
    TOSSING FAKE ORANGE PAPER FLAMES AT HER.                                                                                    2.



                                BUN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  That is, before they were burned 
                  alive by those nice pilgrims...

  We keep moving, past a  DUNK A WITCH  booth, where a WOMAN in 
    a WITCH COSTUME is dunked by a TEENAGE BOY throwing a ball...

                                BUN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  After that, the ones who survived 
                  were forced to take their magic 
                    underground... So far underground, 
                  in fact, that their powers were 
                  eventually forgotten, or else 
                  remembered only as legend, or 
                  superstition... And that s why, 
                  today, nearly every witch who s 
                  born, doesn t even know what she 
                  is...

  We stop at a booth where ROXANNE TORCOLETTI, late-30s, sexy, 
    bohemian, mouthy, sells her art, which seems to consist 
    mostly of squat round goddess statues with big naked boobs.  
  She leans over the counter, resting on her elbows, her SHIRT 
    PULLS DOWN, REVEALING HER CLEAVAGE.  A creepy BROWSER GUY, 
    eating greasy fried chicken, GAPES openly at her rack while 
    holding one of her statues.  Roxie notices, annoyed.

                                ROXIE
                  Chicken hands.  Are you gonna stare 
                  at my boobs all day or are you 
                  gonna buy something?

    Embarrassed, he puts the statue down and moves on.  Roxie s 
  15 year old daughter, MIA, straightlaced and bookish, strolls 
    over, jumps up onto the counter, eating cotton candy.

                                MIA
                  I think the idea is to sell stuff, 
                  not alienate everyone who walks by.

                                ROXIE
                  Maybe I don t wanna sell my art to 
                  greasy tourist pervs.

  Mia picks up a statue and examines it.

                                MIA
                  Who else is gonna buy it, Mom?

                                ROXIE
                  Someone will.  I m not worried: I 
                  had a dream I was about to come 
                  into some money...                                                                                  3.



                                MIA
                  Oh my God for the last time, you re 
                  not psychic!  And if you are, 
                  you re like the lamest psychic on 
                  Earth.  Hey Mia, guess what, I had 
                  a dream that I bought milk and it 
                  came true!  Ooooooooo!

                                ROXIE
                  Hey, that really happened!

    Roxie sees a MAN walk by, she DUCKS down behind the counter, 
    nervous.  Mia leans her head down to look at her mom.

                                MIA
                  Why are you hiding from Homer 
                  Perley?

                                ROXIE
                  I just... owe him a tiny bit of 
                  rent money on the store and he s 
                  been up my ass about it all week...

                                MIA
                  What s a tiny bit?

                                ROXIE
                  -Just a... couple months.  You know 
                  -- one or two.  Or six or eight... 
                        (off Mia s look)
                  Well it was either that or eat, 
                  Mia.  I chose eat!  Call me crazy. 

    Roxie notices something on the ground.  A SHINY COIN.  It 
    looks just like the one we saw get dropped in the fountain 
    earlier.  She picks it up, it glints in the sunlight.

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  I was right!  Fifty cents, baby.

    Roxie stands up, dusts herself off.  Mia s panicked.

                                MIA
                  Are we gonna have to become hobos?  

                                ROXIE
                  Will you let me worry about that?  
                  Be a kid.  Chase boys!  Sneak out 
                  of the house!  Go crazy!  Rebel!

                                MIA
                  It s not rebelling if you tell me 
                  to do it...                                                                                  4.



                                ROXIE
                  Yeah, but it s still fun...

    Just then, a gorgeous piece of strapping man-candy, CHAD, 24, 
  dim but sweet as a puppy, LEAPS OVER the counter and sweeps 
    Roxie into his arms, kissing her passionately.

                                CHAD
                  Mmm.  You look good enough to eat.

    Roxie is a embarrassed.  Mia rolls her eyes, as she spots, 
    ACROSS THE PICNIC, a GREASY, DANGEROUS-LOOKING BOY, smoking a 
    cigarette, leaning against a motorcycle.  She hops away in a 
    hurry to talk to him, Roxie doesn t notice, she s busy with 
    Chad, he s got his arms all over her, excited, she squirms.  

                                ROXIE
                  I thought we agreed on discretion-

                                CHAD
                  I got news, babe.  We re not doin  
                  anything wrong.  And no one s 
                  looking.  No one cares.  No one s 
                  talking about us.  I promise...

  She smiles, reassured, he gives her a kiss, as...

  KAT ROUGEMENT, late 20s, beautiful, dishevelled, but good-
    natured, walks by, carrying a PICNIC BASKET, with her FIVE 
    YOUNG TOW-HEADED KIDS and tattooed husband RAYMOND, drinking 
    a beer.  Raymond spies Roxie and Chad, turns to Kat.

                                RAYMOND
                  Man, that Roxie Torcoletti sure is 
                    a cradle-robbing slut.

                                KAT
                  Raymond, be nice.  She s a widow.

                                RAYMOND
                   Cause she killed the poor bastard.

                                KAT
                  That s just a rumor.

  Kat picks a spot to spread out a picnic blanket. 

                                RAYMOND
                   Prolly true, though.  And she s 
                  still a slut either way...

  One of Kat s kids starts running in a circle, tapping her 
    siblings  and parents  heads (like Duck Duck Goose) chanting-                                                                                  5.



                                KAT S KID
                  Slut!  Slut!  Slut!  Slut!  Slut!

                                KAT
                      (to Raymond)
                  Thank you, for that.

                                KAT S KID
                        (hitting Raymond s head)
                  Goose!
                      (he doesn t move)
                  Daddy, you re supposed to chase me.

                                RAYMOND
                  Daddy will, honey, soon as he 
                  finishes his beer.

  Kat shoots him a look, as she kneels on the blanket, pulling 
    loads of FRESH PRODUCE from a picnic basket.

                                BUN (V.O.)
                  Being a witch, you see, is a sort 
                  of a talent.  Like a nice singing 
                  voice, or being able to tie a 
                  cherry stem into a knot with your 
                  tongue.  Nobody really knows where 
                  it comes from.  Might be genetic, 
                  could be a fluke...

                                RAYMOND
                  Jesus, Kat, more goddam tomatoes? 

                                KAT
                  They won t stop growing...

  Kat notices one of the KIDS has picked up a SHINY COIN, and 
  is sucking on it.  Kat makes a face, and takes the coin.  
    It s another FIFTY CENT PIECE.  It glints in the sunlight. 
    Raymond pops open another beer.

                                KAT (CONT D)
                  Raymond!  You promised you wouldn t 
                  get drunk today!

                                RAYMOND
                  I m not.  It s only my fourth.  
                  I ve barely got a buzz on... Jeez.  
                  Lighten up, Kitty-Kat.

  He kisses her cheek, Kat sighs, we follow one of her 
    screaming kids, meandering through the crowd...                                                                                  6.



                                BUN (V.O.)
                  Born witches may suspect there s 
                  something a bit  off  about them...

  The kid whizzes past JOANNA FRANKEL, early to mid-thirties, 
    hair pulled back in a severe bun, wire-rim glasses, tightly 
    wound, nearly knocking her down.  She s at a stand selling 
    jewelry, where PENNY, mid-30s, quietly judgemental, browses.  

                                PENNY
                  Do these earrings make me look fat?

                                JOANNA
                  Do you think I should just pitch 
                  that corruption story to Clyde?  

                                PENNY
                  Yes.  For the last time...

                                JOANNA
                  But he s just gonna say no.  

                                PENNY
                  How would you know?  You never ask!  
                  You never speak up-

                                JOANNA
                  I don t need to ask.  He doesn t 
                  believe I can do serious stories.  
                  He thinks I m only good for writing 
                  fluff...  Well, that and 
                     accidentally  brushing up against 
                  my boobs in the coffee room.

                                PENNY
                  I know.  He does that to me too.  
                  And then he tries to play it off-

                                  JOANNA/PENNY
                   Tight squeeze in here! 

                                JOANNA
                  He doesn t respect me.  He s never 
                  gonna promote me.  Maybe I should 
                  just quit...

                                PENNY
                  Except if you quit, you won t be 
                  able to torture yourself everyday, 
                  pining over Will.

                                JOANNA
                  I don t pine.                                                                                    7.



                                PENNY
                          (disapproving whisper)
                  You named your vibrator after him-

                                JOANNA
                  My vibrator is only named Will 
                  because I thought it looked like a-  

  She looks up and notices a sensitive, thirtysomething HOTTIE 
    hipster standing there, at the same booth, staring at them 
    with surprise, a camera slung around his neck.  

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  -Will.  Hi...

                                WILL
                  Uh... hi... 

    He s embarrassed, she s mortified, can t look him in the eye.

                                JOANNA
                  -We were just... talking about... 
                  vibrators... 

    Will is somewhat stunned.  Unsure of how to react.

                                WILL
                  Oh.  Yeah.  I... heard.

                                JOANNA
                  -Mine is named Will.  For Will 
                  Ferrell.  The actor.  He s sexy, I 
                  think... 

                                WILL
                  Mm-hm, he s really got something.

    More silence.  Joanna is dying.  Will tries to rescue her.

                                WILL (CONT D)
                  So... I got some great pictures, 
                  for your article-

                                JOANNA
                  -I m not like a weirdo sex fiend.  Or 
                  anything.  I only have a vibrator 
                  because -- there was this 
                  bachelorette party and it was in a 
                  gift bag and I ll admit I was curious-

                                PENNY
                  -Stop talking.                                                                                  8.



                                JOANNA
                  -Anyway, I have to -- be over there 
                  now.  For quotes.  And... stuff.  

    Joanna grabs Penny by the arm and drags her away.  Will 
    watches, bemused.  Penny s mouth is hanging open.

                  Be honest.  How bad?  

                                PENNY
                  Next time, maybe don t use the word 
                   vibrator  so much...

                                JOANNA
                  Oh my God, why can t I be a 
                  completely different person?  I 
                  just want to be a completely 
                  different person-

    Something DROPS FROM THE SKY, BONKING JOANNA ON THE HEAD.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  Ow!

  She kneels down to pick it up.  It s a FIFTY CENT PIECE. It 
    glints in the sun.  She can t figure out where it came from.

                                BUN (V.O.)
                  These witches might sense that 
                  their lives are full of strange 
                    synchronicities, odd, enchanted 
                  happenings -- but they write them 
                  off as mere coincidence, products 
                  of an overactive imagination... 

    Joanna stares at the coin, as they walk.

                                PENNY 
                  So you wanna come over tonight?  
                  Cry into a bottle of wine, watch a 
                  sappy old movie?

                                JOANNA
                  What?  Oh, yeah, sure...

    They walk on, Joanna staring at the coin, past ROXIE AND 
    CHAD, walking through the crowd, we turn and follow them.

                                CHAD
                  Dude, I m gonna hit the ultimate 
                  fris!  Later: you, me, nookie...?                                                                                    9.



  He kisses her, and off he goes.  Roxie watches him, sighing.

                                ROXIE
                  Sure thing... dude...

  She walk past Kat on her blanket, overwhelmed with kids...

                                BUN (V.O.)
                  We re not as tuned in anymore, to the 
                  magic that s all around us, that s a 
                  part of the natural world...

    Roxie reaches a booth labeled  Eastwick Historical Society,  
    where a group of kids sits on the ground, staring up at 
    beautiful, confident, BUN, on a folding chair, holding court, 
    like it s story hour at the library.  Roxie smiles, stops and 
    listens.  Bun waves to her, she waves back.

                                BUN (CONT D)
                  But it s there, always there.  In 
                  fact, some of you might just have the 
                  gift, and not even know it... Your 
                  power might be sleeping inside you, 
                  ready to wake up, when the time is 
                  right -- when you least expect it!

  Bun makes a dramatic gesture with her CHEAP PLASTIC  MAGIC  
    WAND, the kids all say:

                                KIDS
                  Ooooooooo!

    Roxie shakes her head at this nonsense, and moves on... She 
    reaches the FOUNTAIN.  Takes the COIN from her pocket and 
    rubs her fingers over it.  Joanna passes by, with Penny.

                                PENNY
                  God, there s Roxie Torcoletti, the 
                  merry widow.  I can t believe they 
                  let her sell her so-called  art  
                  here.  Around children- 

    Joanna remembers the coin in her pocket.

                                JOANNA
                  Hey, I m gonna make a wish.  You 
                  wanna make a wish?

                                PENNY
                  No.  It s kind of a waste of-

                                JOANNA
                  -I ll be right back-                                                                                  10.



    Joanna trots over to the fountain, leaving Penny annoyed.

    Roxie stares down into the water, still holding her coin.  
    Joanna takes out her coin.  They nod to each other politely.  
    Joanna closes her eyes to focus on her wish.

  Kat approaches, kid on her hip, wriggling, screaming.

                                KAT S KID
                  Ice cream ice cream ice cream!

                                KAT
                  Just let Mommy make one quick wish- 

                                KAT S KID
                        (pointing at Roxie, happy)
                  Slut!

    Roxie is surprised.  Kat s embarrassed.

                                KAT
                  No, honey.  That s a fountain...

    Roxie raises an eyebrow, goes back to her wish.  Kat gets out 
  her coin, closes her eyes to make a quick wish, and then 
    TOSSES IT, just as Roxie, eyes closed, throws in hers, and 
    Joanna too, her eyes also closed.  The coins seem to SLOW 
    DOWN IN MID-AIR, COLLIDING WITH A DIIIIIINNNNNG! BEFORE THEY 
    FALL SPINNING INTO THE WATER WITH A PLUNK.  A STRONG WIND 
    KICKS UP AND BLOWS THE WOMEN S HAIR AROUND.  They exchange 
    freaked out looks, but then the wind stops just as suddenly.  

                                BUN (V.O.)
                  And it will change your life forever.  
                  Like a coin dropped in a fountain-


    Bun s feet are unknowingly planted in a RED ANT HILL.  The 
    ants are beginning to climb up her shoes...                                                                                  11.



                                BUN
                  -They will ride into town on the 
                  back of the wind...

    A WIND BLOWS THROUGH THE BOOTH, Bun sits up straighter.  She 
    breathes in quickly, as if realizing something.

                                BUN (CONT D)
                  Oh my...! 

  Bun looks down, HER LEGS ARE COVERED IN RED ANTS, SWARMING 
    EVER UPWARD.  Her eyes widen, in horror-


    Roxie, Kat, and Joanna stand around the fountain.  There s a 
    sudden BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM, they turn in surprise-

    OPENING CREDITS


  The MYSTERIOUS MAN leaves a posh New York apartment building, 
    trailed by servants with expensive luggage.  We still don t 
  see his face, but he wears the gold ring with a  D  on it.

                                KAT (O.S.)
                  -Something big...                                                                                   15.




  The MYSTERIOUS MAN reads an EASTWICK GAZETTE, reads an 
    article with Joanna s byline.  We see his ring...

                                JOANNA (O.S.)
                  Sometimes I feel like I ll never 
                  get anything I want, you know?  
                  Like I m doomed to forever stand 
                  next to what I want, but never 
                  actually have it...

  The limo enters Eastwick... the license plate reads  DVH. 

                                JOANNA (O.S.) (CONT D)
                  So that s what I wished.  I wished 
                  that I could have it...


    A CUCUMBER in the garden, Kat reaches for it.  She gathers 
    vegetables into a basket from her WAY OVERGROWN GARDEN.  
    Raymond lounges on a hammock, the kids run around, crazy.

                                KAT
                  So Mrs. Neff is coming over to help 
                  with the kids.  There s a casserole 
                  in the fridge-

                                RAYMOND
                  I don t see why you gotta hang out 
                  with them again.  You just saw them-

                                KAT
                  I like them.  You know it s always 
                  been hard for me to make friends.  
                  And I just feel... connected to them.  
                  It s weird.  I can t explain it... 

                                RAYMOND
                  You goin  lesbo on me?

                                KAT
                        (sarcastic)
                  Yes, Raymond.  I am going lesbo on 
                  you.

                                RAYMOND
                  Cool, can I watch?  Or -- videotape 
                  it?                                                                                  29.



  She walks over, gives him a quick kiss.

                                KAT
                  Please try not to drink in the 
                  hammock all night.

  Kat gathers up the kids and rains kisses on them, we see how 
    much she loves them, what a playful mom she is.

                                RAYMOND
                  You know, I hate it when you leave 
                  me alone with Mrs. Neff!  She 
                  smells like toe jam and vapo rub!

  We see that MRS. NEFF, 70s, is walking toward them up the 
    lawn.  She heard that.

                                KAT
                  Hi Mrs. Neff... Thanks a lot...

    Mrs. Neff gives her a disapproving look, Kat sighs and walks 
  to her car.


  The kids run around the yard, Kat exits the house in her 
    nurse s uniform, the kids surround her, hug her, she hugs 
    them back, kisses them, Raymond s in the hammock, drinking a 
    beer.

                                KAT
                  You guys be good... Mrs. Neff is on 
                  her way... Raymond, have you 
                  thought any more about looking for 
                  a new job...?  Your unemployment 
                  ran out two months ago- 

                                RAYMOND
                  That guy just bought the candle 
                  factory.  It s only a matter of 
                  time until they reinstate me.

                                KAT
                  I don t know if we can count on 
                  that... and Mrs. Neff is expensive, 
                  and Amy needs braces, and lately, you 
                  spend every waking minute in that 
                  hammock drinking beer.

                                RAYMOND
                  What, like you re some kind of 
                  saint?  Running around with your 
                  new friends every night-                                                                                  36.



                                KAT
                  Twice.  Raymond.  I ve gone out 
                  with friends twice.  In five years.  
                  And now -- I m going to work.  You 
                  know, that thing that puts food on 
                  our table?

                                RAYMOND
                  What s gotten into you, woman?!  You 
                  think this has been easy for me?  I 
                  can t just go get any random job!  I 
                  was in charge of wicks.    

  Kat can t help it, she loses her cool. 

                                KAT
                  I m not asking for much!  I never 
                  do!  I just want you to pitch in a 
                  little!  Help with the kids, clean 
                  out the garage!  What s it gonna 
                  take?!  Does the freakin  Earth 
                  have to move in order for you to 
                  get out of that goddam hammock?!?!

    Suddenly, the GROUND STARTS TO RUMBLE AND SHAKE.  A minor 
    earthquake!  The kids scream, like it s fun and exciting, Kat 
  is freaked out, Raymond falls out of the hammock with a thud!  

                                RAYMOND
                  ...How did you do that?

                                KAT
                  I didn t... do anything!  I have to 
                  go.  I m late for work-

  He gets up, she s freaked, hurries away, gets in her car.


  ON THE HUGE FOUNTAIN IN THE TOWN SQUARE.  Roxie, Joanna, Kat, 
  and Darryl burst out of the Eastwick Inn, across the street, 
  run toward the fountain.  PASSERSBY stop to stare.  They re 
    laughing, clearly inebriated, passing a bottle of WATER 
    around like it s whiskey.

  The women LEAP into the fountain and splash around, laughing.  
    Darryl watches, admiring, happy.  

    PENNY walks by, cutting through the town square, carrying 
    shopping bags.  She watches the spectacle for a moment, 
    upset.  Then keeps walking.  Joanna doesn t see her.  Takes a 
  sip of Darryl s water.

                                JOANNA
                  This water is amazing!  I feel so 
                  light!

                                ROXIE
                  Me too!

                                KAT
                  Me too!

  The women all look down in that moment, their feet are 
    beginning to RISE in the water, just a tiny bit, barely 
    perceptible -- less than an inch.  This isn t visible outside 
  the fountain, but they see it, feel it.  They all look at 
    each other, and burst into hysterics.  This makes them FALL 
    into the fountain, soaking them.  They splash each other.

                                RAYMOND (O.S.)
                  Kat??  What the hell are you 
                  doing?!

    They look up and see RAYMOND standing there, with the kids, 
  and MRS. NEFF, the babysitter, holding ice cream cones.  He 
  is pissed.

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                  50.



                                        ACT FOUR


    Kat, soaking wet but out of the fountain, argues with 
    Raymond, while Roxie, Joanna, Darryl, the kids, and Mrs. Neff 
    watch from afar, PEOPLE pass by pretending not to stare.

                                RAYMOND
                  We re going home.  Now!

  He grabs her arm, she pulls away.

                                KAT
                  Ow!  Let go of me.

                                RAYMOND
                  You re drunk!

                                KAT
                  I had water!  And you re drunk 
                  every day!

                                RAYMOND
                  I don t want you to see those 
                  people again.  I don t like what 
                  they do to you.

                                KAT
                  You can t tell me what to do!

                                RAYMOND
                  Kat, be a mother to your kids and 
                  let s get in the car.

  Kat looks at her kids.  She looks around and sees PEOPLE 
    STARING at her.  She s embarrassed, grabs the littlest KID 
    into her arms, and walks away with her family.


    Darryl and Roxie and Joanna sit in the back, Fidel drives.  

                                ROXIE
                  She needs to divorce that 
                  sonofabitch.

                                JOANNA
                        (drunk)
                  You know who s not a sonofabitch?  
                  Will.  You know who s totally 
                  awesome?  Will.  You know who I 
                  would give anything to be with?                                                                                  51.



                                ROXIE
                  -Hold on... Don t tell me-

                                JOANNA
                  -Will.

                                ROXIE
                  Really.  I wasn't expecting that.

                                JOANNA
                  -Anything.  I d give anything.  I 
                  just want to make him love me...

  The car stops outside Joanna s little cottage.  Darryl and 
    Joanna get out, he helps her to the door.  She hangs on him 
    drunkenly, but he is a perfect gentleman.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  I m gonna try tomorrow.  I m gonna 
                  see if it works.  I m gonna use my 
                  eyes...

                                DARRYL
                   Atta girl.

                                JOANNA
                  Do you like my hair?

                                DARRYL
                  Yes.  I like your hair very much...

  We see THE FULL MOON rising behind them...


    Roxie s daughter, MIA, walks under the FULL BLOOD RED MOON,  
  now high in the sky, with GUS.  Storm clouds move over the 
    sky, quickly.

                                MIA
                  It s about to rain... 

                                GUS
                  That just makes it more romantic.

  He puts his arm around her, she s nervous, not into it.

                                MIA
                  I m cold, I think I wanna go home-

                                GUS
                  I ll keep you warm.  You promised 
                  me tonight!  You re just scared...                                                                                  52.



  He kisses her neck.  The RAIN starts to pelt them.  He gets 
    more aggressive.  Pulls her to the ground.

                                MIA
                  Gus!  Stop it!  Please!  NO!

    He s on top of her, they struggle.  He gets violent-

                                                                  SMASH CUT TO:


    Roxie and Darryl run up and down the beach in the rain.

                                ROXIE
                  Mia!

                                DARRYL
                  Miaaaaaa!

    Darryl notices something down the beach.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  I see them.

  He runs toward MIA and GUS, who struggle on the ground.  
    Darryl runs FAST, he lunges and easily pulls Gus off Mia, to 
  his feet.  DARRYL PUNCHES GUS.  HARD.  Gus falls to the 
    ground, Darryl looms over him.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  Touch her again, I kill you.

    Meanwhile, Mia scrambles to her feet, crying, into Roxie s 
    arms.  Her clothes are ripped but they got there in time.

                                ROXIE
                  It s okay, baby.

                                MIA
                  Mom...

  Mia holds Roxie, sobbing, Roxie stares at Darryl, who meets 
  her gaze, they share a meaningful look.  She gives him a nod 
  of thanks, he nods back.


    Roxie and Mia walk arm in arm down a quaint street.

                                MIA
                  So how long am I grounded for?

                                ROXIE
                  I m not going to ground you, Mia... 
                  it wasn t your fault, what he did... 
                  But I don t like the way you lied to 
                  me -- snuck around behind my back...  
                  And I blame myself for that -- I m 
                  always telling you to rebel, go wild.  
                  I thought you needed to hear it -- 
                  you can seem so grown-up sometimes... 
                  But I need to be more of a mother to 
                  you.  Hold you accountable.  Find out 
                  where you re going, make sure it s 
                  the truth... Take care of you.  I m 
                  just -- grateful that we got there in 
                  time.

                                MIA
                  But... how?  How did you...?

                                ROXIE
                  I guess we re connected...

                                MIA
                  I am so stupid.  

    Roxie tightens her grip on Mia, hugging her close.

                                ROXIE
                  Sweetie, you are the smartest 
                  person I know.  He s the jerk.  And 
                  so am I...  But things are gonna be 
                  different from now on... I m gonna 
                  be up your butt, young lady.  You 
                  have to check in with me.  Every 
                  hour.  No matter what-

                                MIA
                  Great.  I ve created a Mom-ster.

    They walk off together.                                                                                  61.
