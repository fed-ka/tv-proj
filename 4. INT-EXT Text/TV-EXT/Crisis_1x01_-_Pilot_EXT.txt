Nothing but empty road and thick woods on either side. CAMERA 
FINDS a sprayX  painted orange   in the middle of the road. 

NOW CAMERA leaves that orange X ,  moves down the empty 
asphalt until WE SEE TWO MEN walking down the road away from 
us. They wear DWP COVERALLS. They are KOZ(42) and FLIP (34). 

NOW WE CATCH UP to them, WE CAN SEE their faces. They might 
have been in the military once, maybe not that long ago. 

Flip has a can of ORANGE SPRAY PAINT in one hand and a 
COMPUTER TABLET in the other. Koz holds some kind of SCANNER 
in his hand. Koz looks at it as he walks, saying this--

KOZ
No signal... no signal... no 
signal... signal.
(he stops, steps back)
And... No signal. 
(steps forward)
And... Signal.2.


Koz points down to the spot where the signal starts.

KOZ (CONT D)
Mark it here please.

Using the spray can Flip paints an orangeX    on the road. 
Koz looks back down the road toward that other orangeX .  

KOZ (CONT D)
How far between the two?

FLIP
(consults tablet and--)
2,865 feet.

Koz looks at the terrain and says almost to himself--

KOZ

nationwide coverage, huh? OK, we re

But now Koz looks at Flip and sees something in the younger 
man that makes Koz ask--

KOZ (CONT D)
Something on your mind?

FLIP

 shooting at me. wasn t

KOZ
Well, little brother, if it comes 
to it... you okay with that?

FLIP
Yeah, I suppose that I am.

On this empty road the two brothers look at each other as WE 
HEAR a faint whistle, it GROWS LOUDER AND LOUDER. They do not 
hear it but WE DO as the sound grows into the scream of a--


 powerful An elite Quaker high school where the nation s
parents send their children. BMWs, AUDIs, ROVERS and 
chauffeur driven Towncars drop off the sons and daughters of 
privilege. A few kids drive themselves, Mustangs and Minis. 

Some of the license plates are DIPLOMATIC and from these cars 
step the children of foreign Ambassadors and Royalty.  The 
first car in line is a BMW. WE GO INSIDE IT and find...


As CAMERA moves over it WE SEE it has diplomatic plates. The 
 REPUBLIC OF CHINA. CAMERA DRIFTS into the car.PEOPLE S


TWO SECRET SERVICE AGENTS stand in the morning sun next to 
their black SUV. A SECOND BLACK SUV sits close behind.7.


One agent is ALBERT HURST (45). Almost twenty years in the 
service, as good an agent as there is. He has seen it all. 

The other agent is Marcus Finley. Whatever Finley is about to 
go through hasn t happened yet. He is still fresh and eager. 
Finley SEES Hurst look at his watch and sigh. Finley asks--

FINLEY
Is he always late like this?

HURST
Near enough to always. 

Now bopping out of the PRIVATE QUARTERS comes SETH DEVORE 
(16). Hurst whispers into his sleeve and the second SUV 
starts its engine. Seth looks at Finley then asks Hurst-

SETH DEVORE
And who is this guy?

HURST
This is Agent Marcus Finley. Agent 
Finley this is Seth Devore.

FINLEY
Pleased to meet you, Seth. 

SETH DEVORE
Where is Valens?

HURST
Agent Valens is sick. The flu.

SETH DEVORE
Finley, huh? Never seen him before.

HURST
 first inner This is Agent Finley s
perimeter assignment.

SETH DEVORE
(to Finley)
 take a bullet for me, But you d
right?

FINLEY
I m trained to protect your life. I 
t. be here if I weren wouldn t

Seth stares at Finley then cracks a smile and says--

SETH DEVORE
Welcome to the Brat Patrol. Now 
 gonna be late.come on... we re8.


Hurst and Finley load Seth into the back of the lead SUV. 
Then Hurst gets behind the wheel and Finley in the passenger 
seat. The doors close. Hurst starts the engine. The TWO SUV 
Motorcade rolls down the drive, away from the White House.


Kids carrying and pulling overnight bags head toward the bus.

 A 2013 CAMARO roars into a parking space. From the driver s
side steps LUKE PUTNAM (16), lacrosse God. From the passenger 
side steps SLOAN DEES (16), cheerleader. Luke puts his arm 
around Sloan, she is his. They head toward the bus. Passing-- 

A humiliating little family scene. Beth Ann, Ian by her side, 
watches as her PARENTS ARGUE IN LOUD WHISPERS, IN PUBLIC. 

Luke and Sloan look at Beth Ann, what they are thinking is 
 what a loser Sloan, and Luke golden at glares Ann Beth  .
then Beth Ann turns back to look at her parents. So do we. 

Timid, meek Bill Gibson, in sweater vest and thick glasses, 
tries to stand his ground in front of a much stronger Janice.

BILL GIBSON
 my Why am I here? Because it s
weekend for custody, Janice. That s 
 here. why I m

JANICE GIBSON
But we talked about this. How Beth 
Ann is going on this school trip so 
we are going to skip your weekend. 

BILL GIBSON
I need to correct you, Janice. As a 
 talk about point of fact we didn t
this. You talked to me about it. 

JANICE GIBSON

BILL GIBSON
 afraid there is nothing I can I m
 arranged to be a parent do. I ve
chaperone on this trip, they are 
counting on me. 
(to Beth Ann)
They are counting on me, Beth Ann.

JANICE GIBSON
Oh. Now suddenly you care that 
someone is counting on you?9.


Beth Ann, Ian at her side, withering with the shame of this.

BILL GIBSON
This school offers us generous 
tuition relief. The least I can do 
is help out when I can.

JANICE GIBSON
(leaning in closer)
You are embarrassing your daughter, 
you see that, don t you, Bill?

And now, Beth Ann has had enough. She will end this. 

BETH ANN GIBSON
Enough. Enough.
(to her father)
 You. Get on the bus. But you don t
 look at me. talk to me. You don t
(to her mother)
 see you in a few days.You... I ll

And holding back tears, Beth Ann turns from her parents and 
heads toward the bus. Ian at her side. 

Into the throng of kids heading into the bus Beth Ann goes. 
She looks straight ahead, not wanting to make eye contact.

A curly haired English teacher stands outside the bus door, a 
clipboard in his hand. He is MR. NASH (33). Mr. Nash is just 
the kind of teacher high school crushes were made for.  

MR. NASH
Beth Ann Gibson.

Beth Ann pays him no attention as he checks of her name, just 
stomps onto the bus. Mr. Nash checks off the next student.

MR. NASH (CONT D)
Ian Martinez.

Ian gets on. Mr. Nash continues to check off names. Everyone 
is getting on the bus. Time to go. Last hugs from parents. 


The bus pulls out. One black SUV in front of it. And one 
behind it. The motorcade pulls away from the school and the 
little clutch of parents who have stayed to wave good-bye. 11.



The two Secret Service SUVS and bus full of high school kids 
 capitol, toward rural Maryland heads away from the nation s
on the way to Gettysburg. CAMERA DRIFTS into the follow SUV. 


The three vehicle motorcade. The lead SUV speeds up and pulls 
away from the bus. Heading off to secure the restaurant. Now 
the motorcade is just two vehicles. The bus and an SUV.15.



CLOSE on the big wheels as they roll over the pavement. Now 
WE SEE the bus drive over a spray painted orangeX .  


The bus locks up its brakes and goes into a skid as the 
secret service SUV flies past it, getting in front of it.


Everything has stopped. The bus. The SUV. The Trooper s car. 
Hurst and Finley step out of the Secret Service SUV as--.

TWO TROOPERS step out of their cruiser. They wear large hats 
and sunglasses that obscure most of their face but even so WE 
know them. WE have seen them before. Koz and Flip, no longer 
dressed as DWP workers. Now dressed as State Troopers.


 Secret Service agents Hurst and Finley face the  Troopers .

HURST
 United States Secret Service We re
Agents. We have a protectee on that 
bus. I am going to reach into my 
jacket for my identification now.

KOZ
We know who you are. We talked to 
the agents in that other SUV. 
We got a downed power line up the 
road. Going to have to ask you to 
hold here for a little while. 

FINLEY
(to Hurst)
 the other car radio us?Why didn t

ON FINLEY as he looks at Koz and Flip. Something not right. 
He steps back from them toward the bus and his protectee.

FINLEY (CONT D)
(to Koz and Flip)
You talk to the other agents in 
person or on the radio?

Now something in the heavy woods catches Finley s attention. 
Movement. A glint of something. A man with an assault rifle.17.


FINLEY (CONT D)
GUN!

As Finley calls this out he draws his own gun and turns to 
Hurst. Hurst has gun out now as well but it is aimed right at-
Finley. There is a sudden look of confusion on Finley s face. 
Why is Hurst pointing his gun at him?

FINLEY (CONT D)
...Hurst?

Hurst pulls the trigger and shoots Finley right in the side.


ON FINLEY as he lays bleeding on the ground. He SEES those 
 men with rifles step from the woods. He SEES the  Troopers 
go to join them. He SEES Hurst looking over at him.

 VISION IS FILLED by one of those BLANK MASED Now FINLEY S
GUNMEN. He looms right over Finley, he picks up Finley s gun 
from where it sits on the road and slides it into his own 
waistband. Then he looks down at Finley and says--

BLANK MASKED GUNMAN
Worst first day ever, huh bitch?

LOOK AT FINLEY -- his world is coming apart on this road.


ON FINLEY - he hears the powerful engine of a BIG RIG TRUCK 
approach and brake to a halt next to the bus. He SEES Koz 
open up the back of the truck revealing the empty cargo hold.


ON FINLEY: still on the ground. Ever weaker. He SEES everyone 
herded off that bus. Beth Ann, Ian, Sloan, Luke, Mr. Nash, 
Gibson, Amber.. and now he SEES his protectee, Seth Devore. 

All of them taken OFF THE BUS and LOADED INTO THE BACK OF THE 
TRUCK. The mass kidnapping is a well run operation. Finley 
. it SEES Koz consult his watch and motion to the men  finish

Almost everyone loaded on to the truck now. Almost. Through 
vision blurred with blood loss Finley SEES Anton still on the 
road. He is so scared he has collapsed in a heap of tears. 

Everyone else is on the truck. It is time to go. They have to 
leave now. One of the masked men pulls Anton to his feet. 

ON FINLEY: as he fights the blood loss and unconsciousness 
that tries to pull him under. And now... so quietly, Finley 
gets to his feet and moving like the trained professional he 
is, Finley BLIND SIDES that masked man from behind. 

The man goes down but Finley does not stop moving. Finley 
GRABS ANTON AND RUNS. Off the road and into the dense woods 
that start just five feet from the black top. Gone.

Koz and Flip are back off the truck now. Ignoring their 
fallen comrade they look out toward the woods. 

FLIP
We are out of time. We gotta go.

KOZ
Which one was it?

FLIP
 been here too long. We ve

KOZ
Which kid was it?

FLIP
The little fat one. 

Flip has his tablet out. He flips through school photos of 
the kids on the bus until he finds Anton. He shows it to Koz. 

KOZ
Anton Roth. We need that one. I 
need you to handle it. 

FLIP

The gunman Finley knocked down is back on his feet. Without 
 rifle and runs into the woods.asking Flip grabs the man s

Get on the truck.

He gets in front with the driver. Koz then pulls down the 
 then gets in the Trooper car. back gate, taps the truck  GO 
The truck pulls away. Koz in the Trooper car behind it. 
Leaving behind an empty bus, an empty SUV and a blood stain.


Finley pulls Anton as they run through the trees. Finley is 
in shape but bleeding. Anton is young, chubby and scared. 


Just the abandoned Secret Service SUV and the bus. And quiet. 
Now WE HEAR the roar of an engine and that lead Secret 
Service SUV screeches into frame, brakes hard and stops.

The doors open and the agents in there leap out, guns drawn. 
They search the bus, the other SUV... but everyone is gone.


A sleek CORPORATE CHOPPER waits. Rotors turning. Door open. 
STAY WITH MEG as she gets on the chopper, the doors close and 
it is instantly airborne. Out the WINDOWS her corporate 
rooftop falls away. On the tablet Wolf Blitzer is saying--

WOLF BLITZER (ON TABLET)
We now have information exclusive 
to CNN of the possible involvement 
of at least one and perhaps more 
Secret Service agents...


Finley and Anton huddled against that rock wall. Finley has 
his shirt and protective vest off. There is a bullet hole in 
his side. ANTON CANNOT LOOK AT THE BLOOD. Finley has ripped 
his T-shirt into strips and he begins to bind his wound. 

ANTON ROTH
Are you going to die?

FINLEY
No. 

ANTON ROTH
How come it went through the vest?

FINLEY
There is a small space on the side 
between the fasteners where the 
bullet went. But my rib stopped it. 
Lots of blood but nothing serious. 
You have to help me here, Anton. I 
 tie this binding on my own. can t

ANTON ROTH
 think I can look at that.I don t

FINLEY
Sure you can. 

ANTON ROTH
Please stop telling me what you 
think I can do. I am fully aware of 
my own limitations. No blood. 29.


FINLEY
OK. Then keep your eyes closed and 
hold out your hand. 

Anton does. Finley puts one end of the binding into it. 

FINLEY (CONT D)
Pull it tight. 
(as Anton does)
Good. 

ANTON ROTH
Why did your partner shoot you?

FINLEY
 know.I don t

ANTON ROTH
Well, did he ever do anything 
before to make you think he might 
one day shoot you?

FINLEY
I just met him this morning.
(re: Anton s smarts)
How old are you anyway?

ANTON ROTH
Twelve. I skipped three grades. Why 
did you just meet him this morning?

FINLEY
This was my first day on Seth 
 detail. Devore s

ANTON ROTH
Whose were you on before that?

FINLEY
No ones... This was my first day on 
any detail.

ANTON ROTH

 a newbie. these woods and you re
We re going to die. Aren t we? 

Anton begins to look as if he might cry again. Finley is done 
with the bandage. He begins to put his shirt back on.

FINLEY
Open your eyes, Anton, look at me. 
(Anton doesn t)

FINLEY (CONT'D)

agent. I was a DC cop for three 
years before that. You are not 
going to die. I will get you home. 

Now Anton opens his eyes as Finley takes out his phone.

FINLEY (CONT D)
No signal. We are going to get to 
high ground and call in the troops. 

Anton nods OK and together they set off. 


Finley and Anton emerge from the woods. In the center of the 
clearing is an old farm house. It looks vacant but--

FINLEY
They might have a phone. And if not 
that roof looks high enough to get 
cell reception if we get up on it.

ANTON ROTH
We? I ve made it a life long policy 
not to climb on roofs.

FINLEY
I ll go up on the roof, Anton.

ANTON ROTH
I think that s the smart play.

They head for the house but now THEY HEAR a SOUND LIKE 
 SCREAM BY in DISTANT THUNDER, coming closer and FOUR F-18 S

FINLEY

because of the kidnapping.

Flip, rifle in hand, moves through the forest. On the hunt. 
Flip stops, LISTENS, THEN CHANGES DIRECTION and moves fast. 


Flip, gun in hand, stands outside the farmhouse. He has good 
cover behind a tree as he calls out to Finley and Anton.

FLIP
Hey, I got a deal for you. Give me 
the kid and I ll let you live.


Pudgy Anton, STRAINING, tries to pull himself onto the roof.


Perched in the HIGH OPEN GANTRY of a huge satellite dish is-- 51.

Anton, triumphant, has dragged himself to the peak off the 
roof. He has Finley s cell phone in his hand. Anton sees the 
phone has a signal. He dials 9-1-1 and waits for an answer.

Anton stops speaking when he hears a GUNSHOT from below. It 
is so loud it freezes brave little Anton with renewed fear.

Anton HEARS someone coming for him, climbing up to the roof. 
Now a hand comes over the edge and now another. And now Anton 
sees Finley pull himself up onto the roof. Anton smiles. 

ANTON ROTH (CONT D)

Yeah, I got him.

ANTON ROTH

Finley shows Anton a sophisticated walkie-talkie and explains-

FINLEY
I took it off that guy downstairs. 
I am going to have a little chat 
with whoever is on the other end. 

ANTON ROTH

Finley smiles at Anton. Then keys the walkie and--

FINLEY (INTO WALKIE-TALKIE)
This is Secret Service Agent Marcus 
Finley speaking to whomever is 
listening. The man you sent after 
us is dead. You want to come for 
the body just follow this signal. 


Finley and Anton. Finley speaks into the walkie-talkie.

FINLEY (INTO WALKIE-TALKIE)
...he asked what my problem was. My 
problem is you took kids. Children. 
What kind of person does that? 


Dunn on the phone with the Director. Roth sits nearby.

AGENT DUNN (INTO PHONE)
He says he did it for his kid and 
 guessing ll say. I m all he that s
he was forced to do it for his kid.

FBI DIRECTOR OLSEN (ON PHONE)
Forced or not what he did was take 
out a classified unhackable drone. 
Whoever is behind this has our 
playbook and they know how to use 
it. Who the hell can do that?


Finley and Anton hear that processed voice on the walkie.

HEAVILY PROCESSED VOICE (ON WALKIE)
I have always known that about 
myself. But today the bug is king. 

Freaky. The transmission terminates as FINLEY takes it in.


Finley and Anton walk away from the house into the clearing.

ANTON ROTH
 you pick me? When you pulled Why d
me into the woods. Why save me?

Finley looks at Anton... then Finley tells the truth...

Finley looks at Anton. Is Anton standing taller. Finley

both hear the sound of helicopters coming low and fast over 
the trees. Now they SEE FBI choppers. The calvary is here.

FINLEY

worry about what happens to me.56.


The sound of the choppers so loud. They are landing.

ANTON ROTH

Finley looks at Anton. Whatever is coming is going to be bad.  
FBI agents pour out of the choppers. Guns up aimed at Finley.

FBI AGENTS
FBI. ON THE GROUND. NOW.

Finley starts to get down but not fast enough. The agents 
THROW HIM DOWN and CUFF HIM. Brave Anton tries to get to 
Finley but is pulled away. From the rotor wash steps FBI 
Agent Dunn. She screams to Finley through the engines  roar. 

AGENT DUNN
 KID?WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT S

FINLEY
...I lost him.

And Anton watches, heartbroken, as his savior Finley is 
dragged away in handcuffs and thrown onto an FBI chopper.


The chopper lands. Finley is hauled from it and under heavy 
guard is hustled into the building. Dunn follows. 


Dunn stands outside the front door. Waiting. It opens and

Then one of the other parents,

he just wanted to see his kid. 

Emotion rises up in Dunn and this time she lets it come. Meg 
feels it too and in a voice so soft and tender Meg says--

MEG FITCH
And you just want to see your kid.

AGENT DUNN
I know I said I never wanted to. I--
