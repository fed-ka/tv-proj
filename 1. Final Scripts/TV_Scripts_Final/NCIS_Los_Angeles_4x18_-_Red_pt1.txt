  FADE IN:

  EXT. ROAD - NIGHT11

  A slow pull back from the Hollywood sign.   Iconic.  
  Familiar.  But then things start to get a little weird.   

  It begins to snow.  

  And just as we register how impossible this is, we reveal the 
  iconic panorama is actually a roadside billboard, emblazoned 
  with a tourist slogan:  'What Are You Waiting For?'  We crane 
  down from the sign, revealing we're in the middle of a 
  whiteout.  

  Suddenly a car launches off a snow bank into frame, already 
  airborne, just missing the billboard.  It slams onto the 
  road, cartwheels, skids to a stop on its roof. 

  The DRIVER of the car crawls from the tangled wreckage as 
  flames begin to spread from the engine.  His name is EDDIE 
  SHAW.  African-American, 30s, Marine strong.  He's dazed, 
  injured.  He staggers away from the wreckage, looks over his 
  shoulder as CAR HEADLIGHTS penetrate the snow storm.  

  Gripped with fear, Eddie turns, stumbles along the roadside, 
  trying to get away.  He reaches into his jacket, pulls out 
  his CELLPHONE, stumbles again.  The cellphone, jarred from 
  his hand, flies off into the snowbank.  Eddie scrambles to 
  his feet, keeps running.

  The DRIVER of the second car gets out.  A shapeless figure in 
  a heavy jacket.  A gloved hand reaches into the jacket 
  pocket, draws out a small handgun.  

  Eddie stumbles along the shoulder of the road, sees a slither 
  of hope - a roadside emergency phone.  

  He angles across to the phone, lifts the handset. Pushes a 
  button.  The storm intensifies.  

                                OPERATOR S VOICE
                Please state the nature of your 
                  emergency.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               2.

    CONTINUED:11

                              EDDIE
                      (panicked)
                Help me... I crashed my car... 
                  someone s after me...

                                OPERATOR S VOICE
                I m sorry, sir, you need to slow 
                down, it s a bad line - which 
                  emergency service do you require?

                              EDDIE
                Police, send the police --

  He looks around quickly, sensing someone's presence, can't 
  see anyone through the snow.  

                                OPERATOR S VOICE
                And what is the nature of your 
                  emergency, sir? 
                      (beat)
                Sir?  Are you there?  Sir?

  He drops the phone, takes a few steps, wheels around, trying 
  to locate the threat.

  The Shooter, still walking, raises the handgun...continues to 
  advance through the falling snow...

  ...Eddie, breathing hard, wheels in the other direction& 
  knows his pursuer is close, closing.

  TIGHT ON the hand-gun closing the gap, unstoppable&

  Eddie spins again, nothing behind him.  Suddenly knows he's 
  lost.  He clenches his fists, draws himself to his full 
  height, defiantly shouts into the storm:  

                              EDDIE
                Master Sergeant Edward T. Shaw, 7-3-
                  9-0-2-2-5-1-8, United States Marine 
                Corp.  Semper Fi you son of a 
                bitch.  

  BAM!  Eddie's lifeless body hits the ground.  A single neat 
  bullet wound in the back of his head.

  The Shooter rolls over the body, begins emptying Eddie's 
  pockets. Wallet, house keys, cigarettes, lighter, reading 
  glasses case.  Each item is discarded beside Eddie's body - 
  none of them the object of the search. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               3.

  CONTINUED: (2)11

  The Shooter straightens, hesitates over the body, empty- 
  handed.  In the background, the fuel tank in Eddie's wrecked 
  car explodes in a fireball.  

  A beat, then the Shooter turns away.  

  WIDE on the tableau. Eddie's body. The Billboard.  The 
  burning car.  The Shooter, in no hurry, trudging across 
  frame, back towards the waiting car. 

  And off this tableau, we smash to:

  INT. BULLPEN - DAY22

  SPECIAL AGENTS G. CALLEN and SAM HANNA are sitting at their 
  desks, both sipping coffee, both staring at Deeks  desk, 
  though we don t yet know what they re actually staring at...

                              SAM
                He s going to freak.

                                CALLEN
                Yep.

                              SAM
                He s going to think I did it.

                                CALLEN
                No doubt.

                              SAM
                For the record, I m not 
                  responsible.

                                CALLEN
                Noted.

                              SAM
                Who do you think is responsible?  

                                CALLEN
                Not me.

                              SAM
                Hetty?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               4.

    CONTINUED:22

                                CALLEN
                Maybe.

                              SAM
                Granger?

                                CALLEN
                Less likely.

                              SAM
                He is so going to freak.

  Callen reacts as DETECTIVE MARTY DEEKS arrives.

                                CALLEN
                Standby.

  Deeks enters the bullpen -

                              DEEKS
                 Morning all -- 

  Deeks stops in his tracks, staring at his desk... and we 
  reveal - THE BOX (first seen in EP412-84 - KILL HOUSE).  

                              DEEKS (cont d)
                There s a box on my desk.

                                CALLEN
                Mind like a steel trap.

                              SAM
                More like a mouse trap.

  Deeks approaches his desk.

                              DEEKS
                This looks just like the box Kensi 
                got a few weeks ago -

                              SAM
                You might want to check the 
                shipping label, Deeks.

                              DEEKS
                It is the box Kensi got. What s it 
                doing on my desk?  
                      (freaks out)
                Argh!

  He grabs the box and is halfway between his desk and Kensi s 
  desk when --



                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               5.

                              KENSI (O.S.)
                   Morning.

  He stops in his tracks, caught in the act, as SPECIAL AGENT 
  KENSI BLYE enters carrying a cup of coffee.

                              DEEKS
                This isn t what it looks like.

                              KENSI
                It looks like a man holding a box.

                              DEEKS
                An innocent man. I ve got 
                  witnesses, it s addressed to you, 
                and I was just returning it.  
                Which suggests I took it.  Which I 
                didn t.  The box was incorrectly - 
                or maybe on purpose - put on my 
                desk and ... 
                      (falters)
                I m holding your box.  

  He holds it out to her.  She sits down.  Deeks puts the box 
  on her desk like it s a bomb.

                    DEEKSKENSI
  I ll just put it here.I put it on your desk.

                              DEEKS (cont d)
                You put it on my desk? But this is 
                your box.

                              KENSI
                And now it s yours.

                              DEEKS
                My box?

                              KENSI
                Your box. 
                      (off Deeks  confusion)
                Could you take it off my desk, 
                please?

  Deeks picks up the box.

                              DEEKS
                You re giving me the box?





                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               6.

  CONTINUED: (3)22

                              KENSI
                        (disinterested)
                Huh-huh.

  Deeks puts the box on his desk.  Frowns.

                              DEEKS
                What s in it?  What s in the box?

  Kensi is casual, almost indifferent.

                              KENSI
                Open it and find out.

  Deeks begins to open it - stops. Realizes Callen, Sam and 
  Kensi are all watching.

                              DEEKS
                Is this some sort of devilish trick 
                to pay me back for snooping?  Which 
                I did not do by the way -- the 
                Google of the sender, of the said 
                box, in question. 

                              KENSI
                It s not a trick, Deeks.

  Deeks falters, drums his fingers on the box top.  

                              DEEKS
                Okay.  Then I guess I ll... open 
                it...

  He doesn t.  A beat, then a shrill whistle breaks the moment. 

  They look up to see TECH OPERATOR ERIC BEALE stands on the  *
  mezzanine floor.

                              ERIC
                We ve got business.

  No one moves.  They watch Deeks.

  Eric reacts.  Whistles again - louder this time.  

                              ERIC (cont d)
                Hel-lo?

                              DEEKS
                  ...Later.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               7.

  And he pushes back from the desk.  The others follow suit, 
  heading for the stairs.  Deeks perplexed, Kensi relaxed, 
  giving nothing away.  Callen and Sam walk behind them.

                                CALLEN
                She s good.

                              SAM
                She s very good.

  And they head upstairs...

                There s been a shooting.  The

                Park four days ago.  The victim 
                wasn t indentified until yesterday. 
                An Indonesian national - Rashid 
                Santoso.  Mister Santoso was a 
                vocal supporter of radical Islam 
                and a suspected arms dealer.

                  Increased chatter among Taliban 
                groups in Afghanistan in recent 
                weeks indicates a terrorist attack

                Santoso dropped off the grid ten 
                days ago, after his name was 
                  mentioned in several cellphone 
                  intercepts, suggesting that he was 
                involved in the attack in some way.

                Santoso had two thousand dollars in 
                cash in his jacket.  LAPD has ruled 
                out robbery as a motive.

  Hetty hangs up the phone.

  The SUV drives down a snow-covered road and pulls up 
  alongside two 18-WHEELERS parked close together.  On the back

  have folded out to become one large space.  

  Callen, Sam, Granger and Danny get out of the SUV, collect

  Callen, Sam and Granger take in the scene.  There are half a 
  dozen more buckets, saucepans and containers of all shapes

  dripping steadily from the roof.

                roof?  A little waterproofing would

  Claire gives them a nod as she snaps the weapon back 
  together.

                And that s Dave Voss.

  They turn to see SPECIAL AGENT DAVE VOSS, pouring stock into  *
  a large pot on the stove.

                              DAVE
                No vegetarians?

                either, right?

  Callen and Sam shake their heads. Callen looks the question 
  at Granger.  Granger isn t amused.

                              GRANGER
                No.

  Off Callen and Sam, wondering what they ve stepped into...

  INT. LAVERNE & SHIRLEY - LATER88

  Water drip, drip, drips into a plastic container in the 
  center of the table.  Everyone is squeezed in, Paris and her 
  team eating heartily, Dave fussing about replenishing empty 
  bowls.  

                              PARIS
                Shaw was in Moscow on a five day 
                leave. Visiting his sister.

  Sam passes the bread.

                Did Sergeant Shaw have a security 
                  clearance?

                              PARIS
                Low level.  Worked in transport.  
                Clerical position. 

  An ominous creaking noise from the ceiling.  Callen, Sam and 
  Granger all glance up.  The others ignore it.

                  Emergency services found him about 
                ten minutes later.

                Low caliber round to the back of

                              PARIS
                Not the way Marines normally end up 
                getting murdered -- if there is a 
                   normal .  The ballistics report 
                linking him to Santoso s murder 
                puts it in a whole different light. 

  A CHIMING SOUND interrupts the moment.

  cross to the screen.

  INTERCUT WITH:

  INT. OPS CENTER - NIGHT99

  Hetty, with Eric and Nell in support.

                              HETTY
                Just calling to brief you on the 
                latest with the Santoso 
                  investigation.  Eric?

  Eric does a double take, not what he was expecting.  He 
  stutters into action.

                              ERIC
                Ahhh - right.  The... briefing.  
                Kensi and Deeks - ah - Agent Blye 
                and Detective Deeks - attended the 
                crime scene and found... Santoso s 
                missing shoes. And Nell and I are --

                        (scrambling)
                - we are in the process of checking 
                  Santoso s phone records. But 
                nothing to report.

                              ERIC
                Yet.  Nothing... yet.

                              HETTY
                Thank you, Eric.
                      (leaning into camera)
                And how is everyone getting on in 
                Idaho?

  Callen and Sam exchange a look - is Hetty checking up on 
  them?

                              GRANGER
                  Everything is fine, Henrietta.

                              HETTY

                Ahhh... great to have company for 
                dinner.

  Hetty nods, pleased.

                  Excellent.  We regroup tomorrow.  
                Go to bed. Stay warm.
                      (aside)
                Shut it down, Eric.

  And the screen goes black, returning to the view of the road 
  outside the trucks. 

  Paris gives Callen and Sam a look.

                              PARIS
                What exactly was that about?

                                CALLEN
                  Something.

                              SAM
                  Something we don t know.

                              GRANGER
                  Something we may never know.

  Callen and Sam exchange a look with Granger - for once they 
  agree with him.  

  Off Granger, pensive...

  INT. RACK ROOM - NIGHT1010

  A beat, then the door opens and Callen and Sam enter.  With 
  their duffle bags in hand, it s a tight fit.  Sam eyes the 
  two racks against the wall as Callen dumps his bag on the 
  lower one.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               21.

                bunk?

                                CALLEN
                I was here first.

                              SAM
                G, the last time I slept on the top 
                bunk, I rolled over in the morning 
                and landed on a Petty Officer tying 
                his shoes.  Broke his arm in three 
                places.

  Callen points to the opposite wall, where a rack has been 
  folded up against the wall.  Sam pulls it down, sits on it.  

                              SAM (cont d)
                That s more like it.

  Callen stretches out, testing his rack.

                Hetty was checking up on us.

  Callen doesn t bite. *

                You mean apart from the fact they 
                were both shot with the same

                Shooter carried the weapon across 
                state lines.  

                              SAM
                Looks like a professional hit.

                                CALLEN
                Yet a pro wouldn t use the same 
                weapon twice.

                              SAM
                Means the shooter s arrogant.  
                Doesn t believe he s ever going to 
                get caught.

                                CALLEN
                Judging by the lack of physical 
                evidence he left behind, he could 
                be right.

  He looks at the top rack, then at Sam.  

  Sam looks at Callen, who puts his hands behind his head - 
  he s not moving anywhere.

  And off Sam, realizing Granger has just pulled rank...

                Hetty s unexpected briefing freaked 
                me out because we didn t have

                The car was parked in a lot a 
                quarter mile from the road where

                About the same time his name was

  INT. LAVERNE & SHIRLEY - EARLY MORNING1212 *

  TOAST pops from the toaster.  Callen puts the toast on a 
  plate, opens the fridge, peers inside, takes out a container, 
  butters his toast.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               26.

  Callen looks up as Paris joins him, helping herself to 
  coffee.  In the background, Granger is sitting in the 
    interrogation room, going through files with Claire.

                                CALLEN
                Sorry?

                              PARIS
                It might not be butter.

  Callen is about to bite into the toast.  Stops.

                                CALLEN
                What might it be?

                              PARIS
                  Evidence.  Or a sample.  Maybe 
                  something Dave s growing.  Kitchen 
                doubles as the lab when we re in 
                the field.  Dave s usually pretty 
                good at labelling things... 

  Callen stares at the toast.  Puts it back on the plate.  

  Paris offers him a cup of coffee.

                                CALLEN
                Thanks.

                Sounds like Sam just woke up.

  He sips his coffee.  Looks across to interrogation.  

  Claire is taking Granger through the files.

  Paris crosses to a work station.

                              PARIS
                Hardly.  It was snowing.  Not much 
                left to find.  No footprints, no 
                tire tracks.  No physical evidence.

  The BIG SCREEN changes from an exterior view to a series of 
  crime scene photos.

  Callen gazes at the crime scene photos.

  the coffee table.  Several BAGS OF TRASH in the kitchen.

                              DEEKS
                Okay.  Either Santoso really loved 
                pizza or he had company for dinner.

                Not just dinner.  Two more sleeping

  Kensi takes out her phone, punches in a number as Deeks pulls 
  on gloves and takes a peek in one of the trash bags.

  Early morning winter darkness. The first glow of dawn on the  *
  horizon. The Hollywood Billboard towers over the road.  No  *
  signs of the crash or murder remain. Callen is with Paris, 
  watching Danny sweep the snowbank with a metal detector.  Sam

                Maybe the same thing we re looking 
                for... 

  They exchange a look as Sam joins them.

                              SAM
                Santoso was staying in an apartment 
                with at least four others. Evidence 
                suggests they re geared up for a 
                fight.

                              DANNY S VOICE
                Guys...

  They trudge through the snow to join him as he carefully digs 
  into the snow, revealing a cellphone.  He takes out a CAMERA, 
  takes a photo as the others join him.  Paris pulls on a 
  glove, picks up the phone.

                              DANNY
                  Forty-eight hours in the snow. 
                Gonna need a new battery.    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               33.



  EXT./INT. ROAD - SUV - DAWN1616 *

  The METAL DETECTOR being put in the back of the SUV, the 
  tailgate slamming shut.

  Danny gets in behind the wheel.  Sam slides in beside him. 
  Paris and Callen climb into the back. 

                              PARIS
                We ve done a preliminary check of  
                his phone log. Mostly work-related 
                calls, few family calls... nothing 
                out of the ordinary.  

  Danny starts up, pulls out onto the road.

                              SAM
                Shooter spent valuable getaway time 
                  searching his body. 

                                CALLEN
                And possibly came back for a second 
                look once the crime scene was

                It has to be the phone.

                Well, if there s something there, 
                our guys will find it -- *

  CRUNCH! as a SNOW PLOW T-bones the SUV at an intersection.

  With its engine roaring, the Snow Plow accelerates, pushing 
  the SUV down the road in a spray of snow, sparks and 
    protesting metal.  

  Chaos inside for a moment, then a beat as Sam realizes this 
  is no accident. He pulls out his SIG -- BAM! BAM! BAM! fires 
  up through the sunroof, exploding the glass.  He scrambles 
  onto his seat, rising up out of the sunroof, opens fire on 
  the unseen DRIVER.  The windshield shatters, the Driver 
  swerves the wheel violently.  

  The SUV spins across the road.  Sam drops back into the SUV 
  as it slams into a ditch.  

  A moment to recover.  

                              PARIS (cont d)
                Everyone okay?

                Think so... Go, go  - I m okay... *

  Sam scrambles through the sunroof, drops to the ground.  
  Callen and Paris force open their door, follow him out.

  Sam opens fire at the retreating Snow Plow.  Callen and Paris 
  join him, all three of them pouring fire into the Snow Plow.  

  Suddenly the back tire blows out and the Snow Plow swerves 
  violently off the road and into a snowbank.

  Sam reloads as he runs, Callen and Paris close on his heels.

  EXT. ROAD - DITCH - DAWN1717 *

  They slow as they reach the Snow Plow, close cautiously on 
  the cabin.  The door is open, the Driver gone.  In the 
  passenger s footwell is the BODY OF AN ELDERLY MAN, shot 
  neatly through the back of the head. He s wearing a JACKET 
    emblazoned with the Snow Plow logo.  The real Driver.  

  They move past the Snow Plow.  Tracks lead off into a dense 
  forest.

                                CALLEN
                What were you saying about no one 
                trying to kill you here, Sam?

  The sound of a CAR HORN being held down cuts through the air.   

                              PARIS
                Danny!

  She races back down the road towards the SUV. 

                              SAM
                Stay with her!  I got him!

  Callen turns back for the SUV as Sam heads into the woods.

  EXT. ROAD - SUV - DAWN1818 *

  Paris sprints down the road, Callen behind her. The horn is 
  still blaring. She reaches the SUV, scrambles in beside the 
  unconscious Danny, gently lifts his head off the steering 
  wheel.  The horn stops. 

                              PARIS
                Danny...  It s alright Danny, I got 
                you... I got you...

  He shoots a look at Paris, who is cradling Danny s head. *

  And off their concern...

  FADE IN:

  INT. LAVERNE & SHIRLEY - DAY1919

  INTERCUT WITH:

  INT. OPS CENTER - DAY2020

  Dave is working on Shaw s phone, using a hair dryer to dry it 
  out.  Kai is working at his computer. The mood is subdued.

  Callen, Sam and Granger are on a video conference with Hetty.

                              SAM
                Lost his tracks in the forest.  He 
                must have had a car somewhere.

                              HETTY
                Has the body in the snow plow been 
                  identified?

                                CALLEN
                A local contractor. Shooter 
                probably flagged him down.  Plow 
                driver stopped to help... Shot in 
                the back of the head, low caliber 
                  round....just like all the others.

  Paris and Claire enter.  Dave turns off the dryer.

                              KAI
                How s Danny?

  Dave looks at Shaw s cellphone.

                              DAVE
                Not going to get it any drier... 
                Let s take a look. 

  He plugs a cable into the phone. Nods to Kai.

  Kensi turns to the flat screen, which displays an aerial 
  photo of Santoso s neighborhood.

                The gas station at the end of the

                them point in the right direction.  

  Deeks peers at the building across the street.

                              DEEKS
                What s this building?

  Kensi grabs a tablet, types.  The names of commercial 
  buildings are overlaid on the screen.

                Private residence.  Property owner 
                is - Gloria Starr.

                The Gloria Starr?

                I doubt there s two.  You know her?

                              DEEKS

                more cameras than the Pentagon.  
                Inside and out. But there s no way 
                they ll just hand over their hard 
                drives. 

  A beat, then he senses Kensi is looking at him.  Realizes 
  what she s thinking.  He stretches his neck from side to 
  side.

                              DEEKS (cont d)
                Yeah.  I need a massage.

  And he s out of the car.    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               43.



  INT. STARR HOUSE - DAY2424

  Deeks enters.  The reception area has an Asian theme that 
  wouldn t feel out of place on a 1970s porno set. A middle-
  aged Asian woman behind the counter smiles, nods a welcome.

                                RECEPTIONIST
                Hello, hello. You want massage?  
                Half hour? One hour? Full body?

  She slides a glossy folder in front of him.

                                RECEPTIONIST (cont d)
                You choose a pretty girl, please.

  Deeks opens the brochure. Several Asian girls, each one 
  numbered.

                              DEEKS
                Your place has got a real retro 70s 
                vibe, anyone ever tell you that?
                      (looks at the list)
                I ll have the... number seven.  
                With a number three on the side - 
                just kidding.  She s - good hands?

                                RECEPTIONIST
                Miss Daisy.  Very good.  This way 
                please.

  She hustles him through a curtain.  A longish hallway with 
  half a dozen doors on either side.  A HEAVY-SET BOUNCER sits 
  in an alcove, sipping tea.  He clocks Deeks, fixing him with 
        a  don t-mess-with-the-girls  look.

  Deeks sees a door marked Private, opens it, glimpses an 
  office with a stack of hard drives and a couple of security 
  monitors.

                                RECEPTIONIST (cont d)
                No, no, this way, this way...

  Deeks shoots an apologetic look at the Bouncer, who is half 
  out of his chair.

                              DEEKS
                Sorry, my bad.

  He s shown into a room...    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               44.



  INT. STARR HOUSE - MASSAGE ROOM - DAY2525

  There s a massage table in the middle of the room.  Along one 
  wall, a side table with various massage oils and folded 
  towels.  Deeks pulls a face, takes out his phone, sends a 
  quick text:  What s in the box?

  The door opens and an Asian woman in her 20s enters wearing a 
  super short satin robe. 

                              DEEKS
                   Morning.

                              ASIAN GIRL
                Hi.  I m Daisy, what s your name?

                              DEEKS
                My name?  My name is - 

  The Girl begins to untie her robe.

                              DEEKS (cont d)
                Don t! Don t do that just yet...

  The Girl moves close to him, begins to unbutton his shirt.

                              DEEKS (cont d)
                Or that. If you d just wait for a 
                  moment...

  He smiles.  She smiles back uncertainly.  A beat, then the 
  sounds of an argument from the reception area.  Deeks cracks 
  open the door.

                              DEEKS (cont d)
                Oh no! It s my girlfriend!  She 
                must have followed me here.  You ve 
                got to hide me!

                              ASIAN GIRL 
                Stay here, we ll take care of it.

  The Asian Girl slips through the door.  Deeks peeks out the 
  door after her.

  In the reception area, Kensi is loudly remonstrating with the 
    Receptionist.







                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               45.

                he s not! I ll give him a massage 
                when I catch him...

  The Asian Girl and the Bouncer stand halfway down the hallway 
  watching.

  Deeks steps out into the hallway, crosses behind the Bouncer 
  and slips into the security room.

  INT. SECURITY ROOM - DAY2626

  Deeks pulls out a USB DRIVE, plugs it into the hard drive, 
  types a command via the keyboard.  On screen, a  DOWNLOADING 
  DATA  alert opens.

  IN RECEPTION

  Kensi is fighting a losing battle as the Receptionist and the 
  Asian Girl shepherd her towards the door. 

                                RECEPTIONIST
                You go now!  Go! Go!

                I ll be waiting outside for you, 
                Charlie Ferguson!  You hear me!  

  The Bouncer loses interest, turns away. But instead of going 
  to his alcove, he enters the security room.

  IN THE SECURITY ROOM

  No sign of Deeks.  He closes the door, revealing Deeks hiding 
  behind the door.  Deeks moves.  A floorboard creaks.  The 
  Bouncer turns - 

                              DEEKS
                Is this the way to the spa bath?

  EXT. STARR HOUSE - DAY2727

  Deeks is unceremoniously thrown out of the house by the 
  Bouncer, landing in a heap at Kensi s feet.  

                              KENSI
                No happy ending?

  Deeks looks up at her.

  Deeks picks a freeze frame, zooms in and enhances it.  All of 
  the men are Middle-Eastern in appearance.  He rolls the 
  footage, frame by frame.

                Stop.

  They both turn to see Hetty standing behind them, eyes fixed 
  to the screen.  She takes a step forward, staring hard at the 
  faces.

                some empty spray cans.  I m 
                guessing they applied it to a van.

  Paris looks back at the victim.

                Fair hair, fair skin...

  She looks from Callen to Sam.

                lock down all vehicle access to the

  EXT. TSA SECURITY GATE 3 - DAY3838

  A TSA VAN slows at the security gate, ROBERT SPEARS at the  *
  wheel. The TSA GUARD gives Spears  ID a cursory look, waves  *
  him through, as the phone rings... 

 








                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               52.

  Spears  Van turns onto the perimeter road and the Excursion  *
  and the Caddy close fast on the gate, coming from the 
  opposite direction. They re separated from the TSA van by a 
  mesh security fence.  

  As the vehicles pass, Callen spots Spears at the wheel. *

                                CALLEN
                Sam! The blue van!

                Roger that!

  Sam accelerates, swings the Excursion off the road and 
  punches through the fence, the Caddy right behind.   

  In the TSA van, Spears reacts to the crash, sees the  *
  Excursion and the Caddy closing fast.  He accelerates, 
  crashes through a secondary gate into...

  EXT. AIRPORT - FREIGHT AREA - DAY3939

  The TSA van speeds between rows of air freight containers. 

  The Excursion closes, the Caddy drawing alongside, one row 
  across. The back doors of the TSA van suddenly swings open 
  and two of the TERRORISTS open fire with handguns.  Instead 
  of swerving away, Sam swerves towards them, accelerating 
  hard.  He rams the back of the TSA van, throwing the gunmen 
  to the floor.  

  Another hard hit from the Excursion and Spears loses control  *
  crashing through several freight containers before slamming 
  to a stop against a fence.

  The Terrorists scramble from the back of the van and scatter, 
  opening fire on the Excursion and the Caddy.

  Both teams spill from their vehicles and return fire.

  (NOTE:  The following sequence will be written to suit the 
    location.)

  In a running gunfight, four of the Terrorists go down, a 
  fifth is wounded and disarmed by Claire.

  Callen and Paris pursue Spears, but he vanishes into the  *
  terminal and all they find are his TSA coveralls.    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               53.



  EXT. FREIGHT YARD - DAY4040

  A few minutes later, Callen and Paris rejoin the others.  
  Airport Police are beginning to cordon off the area.  Claire 
  and Kensi guard the cuffed surviving terrorist, ARI HAMAL.  
  Sam, Deeks and Dave are clearing the terrorists  weapons.

  Hetty and Granger survey the scene as Callen and Paris join 
  them.

  Deeks blinks, caught by surprise.

  Granger turns in his seat to see a man entering the bullpen. 
  ROY QUAID, late 40s. 

  BACK WITH PARIS AND CALLEN 

  Sharing a laugh.  And suddenly Paris  laughter dies as she 
  sees Roy...

  And a moment later, he sees her.  The bullpen falls silent as 
  everyone senses the rise in temperature. The tension is 
  palpable.

  An awkward moment, then Hetty steps in...

  Roy ruefully rubs his jaw. *
