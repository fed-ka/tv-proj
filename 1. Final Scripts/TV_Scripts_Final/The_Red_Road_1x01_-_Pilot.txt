EXT. GRASSY CLEARING - RAMAPO MOUNTAINS - DAY

A Ramapo Indian girl (mix of African American, Dutch and 
Lenape Indian) flapping shawl wings -- writing in the air 
 no sound, and then the pulse of drums with smoke -- there s
fade up, a small crowd clapping --

A face in the crowd -- PHILIP KOPUS (40) -- cropped hair, 
mocha skin -- his sparkly blue eyes scanning faces -- looking 
 at a POW WOW for the local RAMAPO INDIAN for someone.  He s
TRIBE, of which you could say he s a member.  

 Kopus notices people noticing him -- he smiles.  They don t
smile back.  He starts walking -- his ex-con body all springs 
 a wholesome atmosphere to the event, and levers.  There s
wheelchairs and strollers; feels like a family picnic.

the sound of drums fading...swallowed by an ominous quiet as 
he walks up on the woods, the colored leaves like a wall of 
fire...


EXT. WOODS - RAMAPO MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

We follow three running Ramapo boys who have strayed from the 
Pow Wow.  PAUL (11), leads the way, wears a taped up pair of 
glasses and a NY Jets windbreaker that s way to big for him.  

Paul spots a grown over wood fence -- thinks fast -- grabs a 
2x4 with some bent rusty nails spiking the end.    

Rocks start flying from out of the woods, thudding all 
around.  Paul and his two friends take cover, giggling -- 

Paul looks down at his sneakers, planted in bright blue paint 
sludge.  Spongy, cake-like, dumped here before he was born.  
He puts his finger in it -- starts to smear blue lines on his 
face -- shows the other two.  War paint.  They follow suit, 
striping their faces when -- 

Three more boys burst from the woods -- the rock throwers -- 
laughing madly.  Paul stands up to meet them, swinging the 
spiked 2x4 -- whoosh -- whoosh --

 weapon --The three boys are stopped, scared by Paul s2.


PAUL
You surrender?  

The boys step back, laughing nervously, one of them poised to 
throw another rock when he sees something.  His demeanor goes 
serious -- he drops the rock.

BOY

All of the boys turn to look as Kopus walks out of a jumble 
of yellow leaves -- greets them with a salute and a wink....  
The other two rock throwers drop their rocks.  Paul keeps 
hold of his spiked 2x4....  

Kopus walks to Paul...takes the weapon away from him... 
noticing the war paint --

KOPUS

Indians?

smudged glasses.

who wiped the paint off their face --

KOPUS (CONT D)
You do everything people tell you 
to do?    

Kopus gives Paul his signature wink, then starts off walking 
into the woods.  Paul and the others watch him carrying that 
spiked 2x4 over his shoulder like some mad Paul Bunyan.


EXT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE - DAY

A police truck parked in front of a house in the wooded 
mountains.  A police officer for the Suffern PD (the cop

The old woman looks at the photo, three small children moving 
around behind her trying to get a look at it.  The photo is 
of a doughy looking premed student named DENIS BRADLEY. 

The Old Woman gives Harold a cold stare while she tears the 
photo into pieces -- handing the scraps out to the children --

OLD WOMAN
I called the police last year about 
a break-in.  Took two days for them 
to send somebody.  But some rich 
boy gets lost in the woods, you all 
 waste a damn second.don t

Harold gives her a polite nod -- turns and starts back for 
his truck -- eyeing the motley assortment of lawn ornaments 
peeking out through the tall grass -- 

HAROLD
Have a nice evening.  

Harold heads for his police truck, hears her slam the door -- 4.

structure on this dirt mountain road.  

He gets out, reaches into his truck s flatbed and grabs that 
spiked 2x4 he took from Paul.  He walks up on the house with 
it, glances at -- 

A big plastic bear standing sentry in front -- stolen from

Harold looks over at the bumper...

HAROLD
An animal?

A big ugly indention in the chrome, specks of red, his own 
shadowy reflection. 

HAROLD (CONT D)
What do you mean an animal?  

Harold touches the indention in the bumper -- his face, like 
he can almost feel this transference of energy coming off 
it...

INT. HALLWAY - JENSEN HOUSE - NIGHT

It s the middle of the night now.  Harold looks in -- Rachel 
is passed out on her bed, Kate sleeping.  Harold moves 
inside, pulls the covers over Rachel.  He walks from the 
room, down the hall.  He peers inside at Jean, lying in the 
 darkness, facing away from him -- hard to tell if she s
 just laying still...asleep or if she s


EXT. DRIVEWAY - THE JENSEN HOUSE - NIGHT

His phone rings -- almost gives him a heart attack.  
He doesn t recognize the number, picks up -- 

HAROLD
Hello?

KOPUS

HAROLD
Yeah.  Who s asking?

KOPUS
This is Phillip Kopus.  Not sure if 
you remember me, we went to high 
school --     

HAROLD
I remember you.  

Harold is seething... 

KOPUS
I know what happened tonight with 
Jean.  You know where the old goat 
farm is, right off the main road?  
Be there in an hour.48.


 believe this -- is Kopus hangs up.  Harold considers, can t
he fucking dreaming or is this really his life.  He goes to 
his truck, about to get in, instinctively fingering his 
holster -- empty -- he forgot about his missing sidearm...

Harold walks into the garage, there s a hunting rifle on the 
wall, he grabs it down -- 


 POLICE TRUCK - TRAVELING - MOMENTS LATEREXT. HAROLD S

 truck pulls up by the stone ruins of some old Harold s
structure...  He gets out, leaves the hunting rifle in the 
 a broken down wooden fence...looks a little truck.  There s
like the one in the little painting hanging in his room.  

Harold hears a motor -- looks over and sees a light -- Kopus 
riding up on an ATV... 

Kopus gets off, walks up on Harold, the two of them sizing 
each other up.  

KOPUS
Been a long time.  

HAROLD
Yeah.  

KOPUS
Somebody hit a kid with their car, 
just took off afterwards.  

Harold just stares...

KOPUS (CONT D)
Couple kids saw it happen -- said 
it was a white lady in an SUV. 
(beat)
Heard Jean was up here around the  
same time...  My mom said she 
seemed a little drunk. 

HAROLD
She was upset, looking for our 
daughter. 

KOPUS
You know I had a lot of respect for 
you back in high school.  Watched 
you play ball a couple times.  You 
were gonna go to Notre Dame, right? 49.


Harold struggles to control himself, rage bubbling up behind 
his eyes...

KOPUS (CONT D)
I know you know what happened with 
me and Jean back then.  I liked her  
brother -- knew him better than you 
did.  Messed me up when people 
tried to blame me for what 
happened.  Forced me out of my own 
state.  

HAROLD
 think anybody forced you.  Don t
But I guess running is the thing to 
 do when you reinnocent. 

Kopus almost starts to laugh --

KOPUS
 a Jackson White it is.     When you re

Harold just stares.

HAROLD
I get the feeling looking at you, 
that you done some time since you 
left here.  You re not talking to a 
guy you crossed paths with in high 
 an ex-con talking school.  You re
 not to a police officer.  And I m
really clear on why you called me 
 looking to out here?  Maybe you re
get sent back up?  

KOPUS
Listen, I know Jean --  

Harold shakes his head, almost laughs -- 

HAROLD
 --No, you don t

KOPUS
Know she would never hit a kid and 
then just leave him to die in the 
road.  Just saying -- believe it or 
not -- you got an ally in me.  And 
cause  gonna need one --  you re
people up here are pretty damn fed 
 gonna dump a hundred up -- they re
years of bad shit back on your 
wife, nail her to the cross.  
(MORE)50.

KOPUS (CONT'D)
I could make sure any witnesses 
give the right kind of statements 
in the morning -- make sure this 
 turn into something.doesn t

Harold looks a little dubious.  He gives Kopus a look, then 
heads back for his truck, opens the door --  

KOPUS (CONT D)
Oh, wait, almost forgot --

Harold turns around...  Kopus hands Harold his sidearm.

Harold takes it, dumbfounded.  

KOPUS (CONT D)
 gonna need that.  You re

Kopus gives him a little salute and a wink, starts walking 
back to his ATV...  

Harold watches him, his face quivering with rage as Kopus 
swings his leg over the ATV and kick starts the engine --

Harold pops the clip out of his gun, checks it, slams it back 
in -- racks the gun.  Holds it at his side, ready...

 stare for a moment... Kopus looks over, holds Harold s
 eyes, a strength that Something formidable in the deputy s
seems to catch Kopus just a little off guard...

After a moment Kopus hits the throttle, goes tearing off down 
some hidden trail... 

Harold stands there, still gripping his gun as the sound of 
the ATV s engine fades to quiet.  The rustling trees seem to 
whisper in the wind, while a thousand thoughts storm behind 
his weary eyes...

FADE TO BLACK.
