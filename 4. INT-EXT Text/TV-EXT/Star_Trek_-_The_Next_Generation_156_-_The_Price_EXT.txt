   Captain's log, Stardate 43385.7. 
   We are in orbit around Barzan, 
   a planet which is entertaining 
   bids for control of 
   what appears to be a most unique, 
   stable wormhole. It could 
   conceivably provide a permanent 
   shortcut within our galaxy. 
 
 
 
 The Ferengi pod moves into position beside the 
 Enterprise shuttle. 
 
 
 As it suddenly blinks into existence in the center of 
 the accretion disk. The subspace anomaly is itself 
 a reflective half-sphere. It is rather like a soap 
 bubble resting on the surface of a table, and can be 
 entered from three planes. 
 
 
 As the Enterprise shuttle noses into the bubble and 
 VANISHES. The Ferengi pod follows a beat later. 
 
 
 The spectacular ride through the light show. A 
 spectrum of primary colors are flowing in waves at the 
 shuttle. There is a beautiful symmetry to these 
 effects. A sense of something perfectly in balance.

 The shuttle continues to move through the light show. 
 
 
 Calm. Quiet. A sharp contrast to the excitement of 
 the last shot. No visible sign of the wormhole...  and 
 then suddenly the shuttle bursts out of "nowhere" ... a 
 beat later, the Ferengi pod follows... 
 
 
 As it stabilizes.

   We made it...

    (to com) 
   Ferengi pod, everybody in one 
   piece over there? 
 
 
 At the other side of the wormhole... which is still not 
 visible... 
 
 
 Alone in space.
