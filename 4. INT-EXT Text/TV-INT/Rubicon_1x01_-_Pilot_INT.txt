      HUGH RUMOHR, 75, fit as a man half his age, sweats alone in 
      the steam.  He is slouched, head down, eyes closed.

      CLOSE on him as he slowly raises his head and squints into 
      the churning white clouds.  He thinks he hears something. 

      Beat, then he relaxes, closes his eyes and sits back.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Rumohr, in a robe, wipes sweat from his face and walks over 
      to a sitting area where toast, coffee, juice and the day s 
      papers are laid out for him. 

      He sits, takes a bite of toast and picks up the front section 
      of the Times.

      He skims the front page, takes a sip of coffee and goes to 
      reach for the next section of the paper.

      His hand freezes a few inches from it.  

      An object is placed on top of the paper.  He picks it up.

      CLOSE on a four-leaf clover.

      ANGLE on Rumohr, his reaction.  Whatever the clover was meant 
      to signify, its intent has been received.

      Beat.

      Rumohr goes to the window.  He looks down at Katherine about 
      to start searching for the kids.

      She looks up at the house and double-takes seeing Rumohr in 
      the window.

      She looks beautiful, happy.  She s about to go back to the 
      game when something in Rumohr s strong, steady stare makes 
      her pause.

      A cloud passes overhead, drawing a shadow over her.  She 
      lifts her chin at him just slightly.

      ANGLE on Rumohr, we might, or we might not, see the smallest 
      fraction of a nod from him.  

      Beat, then Katherine goes back to the game.

      Rumohr steps away from the window, moves to a Jasper Johns 
      flag painting on the wall.

      SHOT of the painting, one flag, within another flag, within 
      another flag.  

      Rumohr takes it off the hook to REVEAL a safe.  He opens it.  
      We SEE $100,000 in new bills and a .9 millimeter PISTOL.

      Rumohr picks up the gun, checks that it s loaded.  It is.  

      He steps back and raises it to the side of his head.

      As he starts to pull the trigger to blow his brains across 
      the room... 

      CAMERA slides away to the antique canopy bed under which we 
      SEE Charlie Rumohr has been hiding.

      DANIEL HADDAS, 67, is on the phone but waves Will in and 
      directs him to a chair.  Will sits.

      Haddas has a round face, round glasses and a round body.  He 
      is a patient, wise man with nothing to prove.

      PAN the room to find charms, talismans, pendants and amulets 
      from his wide travels.

      One item sticks out...an industrial broom.

      Haddas gets off the phone. 

                                  WILL
                    What s with the broom?

                                  HADDAS
                    Mitchell was sweeping up the other 
                    night as I was leaving.  He brushed 
                    one of my shoes by accident.  

                                  WILL
                    Let me guess, bad luck?

                                  HADDAS
                    Very.  Brings imprisonment or 
                    death.  The only way around it is 
                    to spit on the broom, so I bought 
                    it from him and did what I had to 
                    do.  Ridiculous, I know. 

                                  WILL
                    I found a pattern in the big ticket 
                    papers.  And there might be others.

      Will hands him the list, the crosswords and the work he s 
      done drawing out the connections.

      Now Will walks Haddas through it.  

                                  WILL

                    nothing 13th President.  The 
                      executive.  Four down, would-be 
                    alma mater of felonious record-

                                  HADDAS
                    Which is?

                                  WILL
                    Four-leaf clover.  Our three 
                    branches of government are here:  
                      legislative, executive and 
                    judicial.

                          (beat)
                    So what, or who, does the fourth 
                    leaf represent?  

      Beat of Haddas studying the pattern.

                    Usually they re a little more 
                    subtle borrowing from each other. 

      Haddas sets Will s documents on a massive stack of papers.  
      Clearly they ll never get looked at again.

                                  HADDAS
                    Thanks, Will.

      Beat, Will slowly rises, turns to leave, hesitates a last 
      beat, then exits.

      As soon as he s gone, Haddas takes out a piece of paper and 
      starts to hurriedly scribble.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                  HADDAS
                    Something in the crossword today.  
                    I ve never seen anything like it.

                                  INGRAM
                    Which paper?

                                  HADDAS
                    All the indicators.  Someone either 
                    didn t expect the pattern to be 
                    caught or wasn t afraid if it was.

      Haddas gives Ingram the list of ten words which is now in his 
      handwriting instead of Will s.

      Ingram scans it so fast it seems impossible he s actually 
      read it.

                                  INGRAM
                    Whose work is this, Daniel?

                    Depends on what you think of it.

      He sits at his desk and picks up a generic, half-finished 
        Hallmark-ish  HAPPY BIRTHDAY  card, and shreds it.

      He takes out a note card and WRITES a short note.  We do not 
      see what he s written.

                    Happy birthday.

      Will jokingly shakes the gift.  It s very obviously a book.  
      He removes the wrapping.

      We SEE it s  BEST ROAD FOOD IN AMERICA  a guide to out-of-the-

                    Only kind of question to ask. 

      Haddas now gives Will a sealed envelope.  Will starts to open 
      it but Haddas puts a gentle hand on Will to stop him.

      a beat right where he is.  

      He pats Will on the shoulder.  

      Beat, Will looks up at him.

      Haddas has a look of pride and approval, almost paternal.

      Long beat where the train seems to be gliding through space 
      and time with an extraordinary smoothness, lolling easily 
      side to side with a calming, appeasing rhythm.

      Then...

      CAMERA slowly rises beside a man in a gray cashmere overcoat

      Will comes out of his office and is about to leave when he 
      HEARS a single phone ringing down the corridor.

      He walks on for a beat but can t shake that single, shrill 
      ring stubbornly sounding off, like Satan mouthing off to God.

      Several rings, then a brief respite, then ringing again.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Knight to king s bishop three.

      Beat, Will is silent.

                                  VOICE
                    Knight to king s bishop three.

                                  WILL
                    Who is this?

      Beat.  Then...

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    He s dead, isn t he?
                          (beat)
                    Why?

                                  WILL
                    Who is this?

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    I asked why.

                                  WILL
                    It was an accident...

      The line goes dead.  

      Beat, then Will wakens Haddas s computer and does a quick 
      system search for  CHESS  

      Nothing comes up.

      Will gets up and pulls the blinds, then starts looking around 
      the office.  As many times as he s been here, he s trying to 
      see it with new eyes.

      Will starts in a corner and moves around the room s 
      perimeter.  He moves quickly but carefully.  He SEES nothing 
      that catches his eye.

      CAMERA slips between the blinds to SEE Kale Ingram exiting 
      his office and starting to walk this way.

      Back to Will, going through Haddas s file cabinets, drawers 
      and armoire.  

      Whatever he s looking for, he s not finding it.

      CAMERA moves back to the doorway to SEE Ingram approaching.

      He s just a few feet away, when he realizes he s forgotten 
      something and heads back to his office.  

      Back to Will taking a beat to stop, shut his eyes and then 
      open them again.

      CLOSE on him as he glances around the room.

      Something catches his attention...a globe fitted and sunk 
      into an antique wooden table.  

      Will SEES a HOOK keeping the globe shut.

      He unlatches the hook and opens the globe.  

      Inside, he finds a chess board.  The intricately hand-carved 
      pieces are arranged in the middle of a game.

      Will picks up a pawn and SEES initials carved into the 
      bottom:   EB 

                                  WILL
                    EB.  EB.  EB.
                          (eyes flare, he knows)

                    E...B...

      Will pockets the pawn, shuts and latches the globe, then 
      steps out of Haddas s office into the 

      CORRIDOR

      and walks rapidly away.

      CAMERA watches him go for a quick beat, then rotates around 
      to find Kale Ingram standing there.  

      Ingram saw Will exit Haddas s office.

                                                                            CUT TO:

2121

      Will enters the living room which has bric-a-brac and debris 
      a foot thick on the floor.  The only furniture in the place 
      is a La-Z-Boy recliner covered in cat fur.  

      On the tiny kitchen counter, we SEE twenty oversize 
        prescription bottles.

      Will SEES a chess board on the dining room table.

      Ed SEES Will taking note of it.

                                  ED
                    A month or two, a year or two.  
                    Time s a whore.  As for whom I was 
                    playing, who do any of us ever 
                    contend with?

                                  WILL 
                    What were you comprehending, Ed?

                                  ED
                    The work we do:  genesis, progress, 
                      judgement.  Who is it used by?

                                  WILL 
                    Our employers.

                                  ED
                    You do know they hide in plain 
                    view, don t you?  

                                  WILL 
                    Who s  they? 

                                  ED 
                    They?  They s them!  What s the 
                    matter with you?

      Ed violently wipes his hand across the chess board, 
      scattering the pieces.

                                  WILL
                    Nice talking to you, Ed.

      Will starts for the door.

                                  ED
                    They must ve exposed themselves.  
                    Daniel must ve made a connection so 
                    clean they had to act.

      Will stops.

                                  WILL
                    It was a train wreck.  Turn on the 
                    TV, read the paper.  You ll see 
                    Daniel wasn t the only one lost.


                                  ED
                    Train wreck, train wreck, so much 
                      collateral damage, so much grief, 
                    no one would even dream it was all 
                    to silence one man.
                          (beat)
                    You do know they hide in plain 
                    view...

      Ed suddenly quiets, steps back and sinks into his recliner.  
      Deep in the cushions, he looks small, lost and vulnerable.

                                  ED 
                    It s too much.  It s just too much.

      Ed s voice drifts off, he averts his eyes.

                                  ED
                    All the friends I had there, only 
                    one stayed in touch, came by, tried 
                    to keep one of my feet in the real 
                    world, reminded me who I was.  


      ANGLE on Will, his frustration with Ed turning to sympathy.

                                  WILL
                    Goodbye, Ed.

      Ed is still too emotional to face Will.

      Will exits.  The moon has risen, drawing Will s nocturnal 
      shadow on the broken sidewalk.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                  ACT THREE

      FADE IN:

2222

      Will is sprawled out on the couch, an open book on his chest 
      rising and falling with his breath.

      CAMERA arrives at his face, eyes closed, it looks like he s 
      finally sleeping.

      Hold this for a beat, then his eyes flutter open.  He wasn t 
      sleeping, not even close.

      He sits up, the book sliding to the ground.  He drops his 
      head to his chest, runs his hands through his hair.  

      CAMERA closes on his face and we SEE the effects of his 
      worsening insomnia.  

      His skin is pallid, eyes bloodshot and dry, but more than 
      these physical effects, it s his spirit that s fatigued.

      TIME CUT:

      Will sitting at his desk.  The same mountain of material and 
      work waits for his attention but he s staring straight ahead, 
      not even daydreaming, just lost.  

      Beat, then his eyes fall on the book Haddas gave him  BEST 
      ROAD FOOD IN AMERICA 

      Will opens it, flips around and then puts it back down.

      TIME CUT:

      WILL S POV...


      Victoria and Tanya appear in his doorway.  We SEE them 
      talking but we HEAR nothing.

      Beat, then they walk away.

      Bob Test comes after them.  We SEE him offer a few platitudes 
      but again HEAR nothing.

      TIME CUT:

      WILL S POV...

      Miles Fiedler knocks on the door and starts to talk but again 
      we HEAR nothing.  After a beat, he walks away.

      TIME CUT:

      End of the workday.  Will has not moved.  

      We SEE Maggie in the doorway talking but we don t hear her 
      for a beat.  Finally...

                                  MAGGIE
                    Will?

                                  WILL
                          (without looking up)
                      Goodnight, Maggie.

      CLOSE on Maggie, wishing she could say something to comfort 
      him but knowing that s impossible.  Beat, then she forces 
      herself to walk away. 

      TIME CUT:

      Night.

      After twelve hours seated without moving, and still no closer 
      to an answer of how or why this could happen, Will suddenly 
      stands and exits.

                                                                            CUT TO:

2424

      Maggie answers her door, half-asleep, and finds Will has come 
      to see her.  She couldn t possibly look more surprised.

                                  WILL
                    I m sorry to wake you...  

      Will moves past her into the small, brightly colored 
      apartment that straddles a fine line between lived-in cozy 
      and bursting at the seams.

                                  WILL
                    I didn t know where to go.

      Will speaks in a highly animated voice, almost manic, nothing 
      like we ve heard from him before.

                                  WILL 
                    I know how this is going to sound, 
                    but all the rituals, his rituals, 
                    how superstitious he was... 

                                  MAGGIE
                    Slow down.  

                                  WILL
                    His biggest phobia by far was the 
                    number 13.  Respected and feared 
                    it, constantly watched out for it.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Will, can you lower your voice?

                                  WILL
                    He d never step on an elevator, 
                    boat, taxi or train whose serial 
                    number started or ended with 13, 
                    was divisible by 13, aggregated to 
                    13, was divisible by 13...  

                                  MAGGIE
                    Your voice, Will.

                                  WILL
                    His car hasn t been retrieved yet.  
                    It s still in the parking lot at 
                    the train depot where he left it.
                          (hesitates, then)
                    Where he supposedly left it.

                                  MAGGIE
                      Supposedly?

                                  WILL
                    His car is parked in spot 13.  

                                  MAGGIE
                    Maybe he didn t notice the number.

                                  WILL
                    He saw the number.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Maybe he needed to get to work, saw 
                    the train pulling up and it was the 
                    only space open.


                                  WILL
                    There is no way Daniel Haddas would 
                    park there.

                                  MAGGIE
                    If Daniel didn t park there...

                                  WILL
                    He never boarded that train. 

                                  MAGGIE
                    But his remains were identified.

                                  WILL
                    I know...

                                  MAGGIE
                    So how were they found there in the 
                    wreckage?

                                  WILL
                    I don t know.  I don t know.  I 
                    don t know.

                                  MAGGIE
                    What happened was horrible.  But 
                    Daniel s gone.  He boarded the 
                    train and it crashed.  He died 
                    along with 36 strangers.  Maybe 
                    there is no why.

                                  WILL
                    There s always a why.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Will...

                                  WILL
                    You just don t understand.

      Maggie regards him.  She intuitively knows there s something 
      more, and knows it s beyond reach.

                                  MAGGIE
                    How long has it been since you ve 
                    had a good night s sleep?

                                  WILL
                    I can t remember.

                                  MAGGIE
                    You need to rest.

      Will nods and lowers his head. 

                                  MAGGIE
                    This is hard.

                          (beat)
                    Yeah.

      Beat, then Will looks up at her.

      Maggie reaches out and guides a rope of hair out of his eyes, 
      a tender gesture she s been wanting to make for years.

      Their close proximity and his broken down vulnerability 
      suddenly turn this beat intimate and volatile.

                                  KYLE (O.C.)
                    Mommy?

      They both turn to find Maggie s 5 year-old daughter, KYLE, 
      clutching her stuffed clown.  Maggie walks over and picks her 
      up.  Kyle buries her face in Maggie s neck.


      ANGLE on Will, utterly stunned.  He starts to back away.

                                  WILL
                    I m sorry.

      He quickly moves to the door and exits.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Things are back to normal, a busy din of activity.  Will 
      takes the usual route to his office.  

      Will enters, says brief hellos to Fiedler, Test, Victoria and 
      Tanya but keeps moving.

      Ahead, he SEES Maggie.


      She s dressed a little more casually than we ve seen, her 
        shoulder-length hair down.  She looks beautiful.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Did you get any rest?

                                  WILL
                    I m sorry about last night.  Is 
                    your daughter...

                                  MAGGIE
                    She s fine. 

      Maggie notices a sealed envelope in Will s hand.

                                  MAGGIE 
                    What s that?

                                  WILL
                    My resignation.

      This knocks the wind out of Maggie.

                                  WILL
                    There s nothing to worry about, 
                    Maggie.  I ll be gone but your life 
                    won t change much.  

                                  MAGGIE

                    You know they ll put him in 
                    Daniel s job the minute you turn it 
                    down.

      Beat.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Where are you going?

                                  WILL
                    Away.  I m going away.

      Maggie recovers enough to offer a bluffing nod.

      Will enters his office.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      CAMERA moves slowly down a hallway with ornate, stained 
      carpet to a bank of conference rooms, none of which are 
      occupied except the last one.


      There is an eerie quality to the silence here.  The only 
      sound is heated air pumped from ventilation shafts.  

      The art on the walls depicts duck and fox hunts, all of it  
      mass-produced and brutal.

      Finally, we come to the last conference room where an 
      aluminum tripod displays a flimsy cardboard sign which reads:  
       WELCOME  with a smile face in the  O 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Six people, different backgrounds, different hometowns, but 
      their destination, this table, is all that matters.  

      These are the TRUSTEES, appointed for life.

      A few are already seated, a few are standing at a buffet of 
      orange juice from concentrate, burnt coffee, nitrate-filled 
      muffins and taste-free melon.


      They are all talking, laughing, glad to see one another.  
      Some show off pictures of family, some of pets.  These people 
      have known each other a long time.

      Without any prompt, the group quiets, those at the buffet 
      find their seats and the business of the day gets under way.

      ANTHONY PRICE, 48, six four, ruggedly handsome, more God than 
      mortal, looks down the table and starts.

                                  PRICE
                    As anticipated, Pendry Goss should 
                    flatline before today s closing.  
                    We re commissioning an autopsy 
                    study in the morning.  Safe to say, 
                    this is one white paper that should 
                    make for some entertaining reading.  
                    I ll have them expedite.  

      Next is YVONNE TAYLOR, 50, a voluptuous brunette, loud 
      dresser, mind sharp as a boxcutter.

                                  YVONNE
                    The analyst who found the crossword 
                    design, Daniel Haddas is his name.  
                    He s been reassigned.

      DR. THOMAS STERN, 65, has a tan from Palm Springs and an 
      unlit pipe clacking softly in his honey-colored teeth. 


                                  STERN
                    And his replacement?

                                  YVONNE
                    Someone s been identified. 

      The youngest of the group, 46 year-old DANA WHITESIDE from 
      the Chicago suburbs, speaks up.  

                                  WHITESIDE
                    What about the widow?

                                  YVONNE
                    For Hugh s audacity she deserves...

      Yvonne is cut off by BLAKE BROBITH, African-American, halo of 
      gray hair, a jolly face you expect to smile but never does.  

                                    BROBITH
                    We let her be.

      Not another word is needed for consensus to be reached.  All 
      agree, Yvonne shrugging and relenting last.

      The oldest at the table, WARREN SILLIMAN, 91, leans forward.  
      His thinking is graced by a keen, long view of history.

      He coughs.  He s about to start talking again but another 
      cough stops him.  This evolves into a locomotive wheeze.  He 
      clumsily pours himself a glass of water.

      He waves at the group to continue on.  

      After a beat...

                                    YVONNNE
                    We ve gotten some clarification on

      Maggie KNOCKS in Will s doorway.


                                  MAGGIE
                    He s ready.

                                  WILL
                    Thanks.

      Will walks out of his office and starts down the 

      CORRIDOR

      toward Ingram s office.

      As he passes Daniel Haddas s office, he glances in to find 
      MOVERS quickly and sloppily packing up his belongings.

      SHOT of a mover throwing the broom Will noticed early on into 
      a garbage bag.

      CLOSE on Will, deeply upset, enraged, by the lack of care the 
      movers are taking and by the simple fact that Haddas is gone 
      for good.

      SHOT of Will fingering the resignation envelope as he 
      approaches Ingram s office.

      Just before entering, he slips it into his jacket pocket.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Will enters.

                    Apologies again for the lack of 
                    decorum.  They just won t wait.

      Ingram gets up and comes around his desk.

                                  INGRAM
                    I need your answer.

      Will slides his hand into his jacket pocket.

      ANGLE on Will, vengeance in his heart, studying Ingram.

      Finally, Will takes his hand out of his jacket without the 
      envelope and offers it to Ingram.

      Ingram shakes his hand.

                                  INGRAM
                    What changed your mind?

      Ingram studies Will, concludes he can still be trusted.

                                  INGRAM
                    You know, I don t care.  Let s 
                    introduce you upstairs.

      FOLLOW them out into the


      CORRIDOR

      where they head toward the elevator.

      CAMERA is tight on Will.  Behind him as he walks, we SEE 
      STAFFERS turn and stare.

      Will and Ingram arrive at the elevator.  Ingram fits a key 
      into the lock and turns it.  

      The doors open.

      Ingram steps aside for Will.

      Will looks Ingram in the eyes, then boards.

      Ingram takes a step forward but then stops and doesn t enter.

      ANGLE on Will, surprised and confused.

      Ingram locks eyes with Will as the doors close.

      CLOSE on Will as the elevator starts to ascend.  

      Hold this beat for a solid five count, interminable.

      SHOT of the stress building on Will s face.

      Finally, the elevator reaches its destination.

      Just as the doors are about to open...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.
