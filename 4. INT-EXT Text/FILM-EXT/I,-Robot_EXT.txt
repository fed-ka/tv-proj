...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the
elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity.
Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His
shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He
turns and sees...
A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still
obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering
hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up
with a muted WHIR...
ROBOT
(metallic voice)
Good day, sir...
Spooner. Speeds up his pace.
Weaving through the crowd to
lose the robot.
We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment
buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic.
PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting
portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:
Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building
cleaning windows.
A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently
repairs the street. No human supervision.
A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk.
Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...
Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners.
Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries.
Briefcases.
Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:
III LAWS SAFE.
Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.
Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's
neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.
LITTLE GIRL
Hi.
3.
SPOONER
Hi.
But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.
The
robot turns. Looks at the girl.
ROBOT
You are not allowed to talk to
strangers.
Spooner, disgusted.
Has had enough.
He steps off the curb
Just as...
THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.
Training its large
digital EYE on him:
TRAFFIC LIGHT
Please return to the sidewalk.
Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.
TRAFFIC LIGHT
Please return to the sidewalk...
The traffic signal, tracking him.
TRAFFIC LIGHT
You are in violation of city
ordinance 14-B726...
Spooner throws up his hand. Flipping it the bird just as
SNAP! It takes his picture.
CUT TO:

Spooner stepping onto a sleek, densely packed TRAIN. Looks
down at his feet. A trampled flyer on the ground. From the
Anti-Robot League: METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED!
A Robot gets up. To offer him his seat. Spooner. Turns his
back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL...
9
9
The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN. Soaring, gravity-defying
OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline. Older buildings
wedged among the new. All protected by huge glass and steel
shields.
As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to
disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.
The "old" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.
4.
10
10
Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging
Police Headquarters. Modern additions have been made to the
original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess.
11
12
A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city
blocks. The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and
ROBOTS.
13
32
BAM! He BURSTS out into the PLAZA in front of U.S. Robotics.
Squinting into the light. Then PLUNGING into the crowd...
HUMAN...ROBOT...HUMAN...ROBOT...they all look the same from
behind. Spooner running. Through the sea of MAN and
MACHINE. When someone. Starts to SCREAM. At the sight of
his GUN. The crowd begins SCATTERING. Chaos. Spooner
stops. Near a fountain. Turning 360. Looking everywhere...
The Robot.
Gone.
SPOONER (V.O.)
...I want a homicide unit on every
street, sidewalk, alley...
33
34
Spooner. Rolling along in his car.
Eyes, bloodshot.
Peering out the window:
An NS-2 model ROBOT laden with shopping bags, following its
owner down the sidewalk...
Another ROBOT, opening the door at a hotel for GUESTS...
A couple HAULING ROBOTS, loading heavy boxes onto the back of
a truck...
Spooner.
Rubs his eyes.
Turns a corner and spots:
A ROBOT REPAIR SHOP.
28.
The latest models in the window. Shiny. Streamlined.
Spooner watches as a WOMAN leads her faulty NS-2 to the
service entrance.
He stops the car.
35
36
Elegant condos set on prime real estate. Calvin heads down a
tree-lined walk towards her condo entrance.
SPOONER (O.S.)
One of my bullets hit your robot...
Startled. She drops her key card. As Spooner steps out from
behind a tree. The tail of his coat, whipping in the wind.
CALVIN
Detective!...
SPOONER
And I think it's smart enough to
repair itself -- don't you?
CALVIN
(studying him)
Yes. I think so.
SPOONER
Where?
CALVIN
Any repair shop...
SPOONER
No. It's always the owner who
brings the robot in for repair.
Where would a robot without an
owner go?
29.
CALVIN
I'm not sure what you're getting
at.
SPOONER
(stepping closer)
Does U.S. Robotics have a factory
in the city limits?
Calvin.
Tucking her hair behind her ears.
CALVIN
The locations of our factories are
classified.
SPOONER
I don't care.
Calvin.
Looks up at him.
A Mexican stand-off.
CALVIN
I have several conditions if I show
you.
SPOONER
I expected that.
CALVIN
First. I want it brought in
unharmed.
SPOONER
(doesn't like it, but)
Agreed.
CALVIN
Second.
I want to talk to it,
alone.
SPOONER
Too dangerous.
CALVIN
This model violated the Three Laws.
It also moved and reacted
differently than any robot I've
ever seen. There must be some sort
of logical explanation. I want to
find out what that is. No police.
No prosecutors. No you. Just me
and the robot.
Spooner, looks down at this small woman.
Narrows his eyes.
30.
SPOONER
When they told me you were a
psychologist, that wasn't the whole
truth, was it?
CALVIN
I never said I treated human
beings.
37
37
Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16-
lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS
stretches forever in either direction.
A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with
TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to
manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head.
CALVIN
That should be outlawed once and
for all.
SPOONER
That'll be the day I stop driving.
Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR.
Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale.
CALVIN
I can recommend a behavior
modification program, you know --
if you want to overcome your robo-
phobia.
SPOONER
I'm not afraid of robots.
I just
don't like them.
CALVIN
Why? Because they make every
aspect of our lives more
convenient?
SPOONER
Exactly. They do our dirty work.
Ever do hard labor, Doctor? Gets
pretty old, pretty fast. Nobody
can do someone else's dirty work
without coming to hate them. I
don't want to be around when your
robots decide they've taken their
last order.
31.
CALVIN
That day will never come,
Detective. Robots aren't like
human beings -- they don't question
their existence.
Spooner cranks the gear shift.
Throwing her a look.
SPOONER
Spoken like a true robo-phile.
38
38
The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
Spooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade
of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant. A long STEEL GATE -- too
high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex.
39
39
Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R.
ID. She shoots a look at Spooner. They wait. Then, slowly,
the gate begins to open.
40
46
The Robot Suspect takes its chance.
Runs full out.
STOPS.
Bergin is standing in front of a solid wall of POLICE CARS.
UNIFORMED OFFICERS are aiming SPECIALISED RIFLES at the
Robot. FLASHING LIGHTS reflecting off its metal surface.
The Robot turns to Spooner.
Extends its hands.
Palms out.
ROBOT
WHAT AM I?
Spooner is surprised. A POLICE OFFICER fires, RUBBERISED
NETTING shooting out at Sonny. A SECOND OFFICER fires and a
second net covers him. Then a THIRD...
...and the Robot falls to the ground, struggling.
Calvin glares at Spooner.
Furious.
Hurt.
Betrayed.
CALVIN
We had a deal.
But Spooner doesn't look at her.
His eyes are locked on that
Robot.
47
52
Spooner.
Trotting down the front steps of the Police
Station.
Pissed. His cell phone BLEATS...
46.
SPOONER
(answering)
Spooner.
BALDEZ' VOICE
They're making me turn over all the
evidence...
INTERCUT WITH:
53
56
Spooner driving. A small TELEVISION above the windshield.
LANCE ROBERTSON holding a PRESS CONFERENCE outside U.S.
Robotics...
ROBERTSON ON TV
...and I just want to assure you that
this was an isolated incident. The
prototype is now in custody -- and
scheduled for destruction. Your
robots are perfectly safe. There
is no cause for alarm...
Spooner's lip curls. Eyes flicking to a GPS display on the
dashboard. A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP pinpointing HOGENMILLER'S
HOUSE. The CURSOR. Directing him to turn up...
A STEEP DRIVEWAY
Narrow. Out of the way. Spooner's brow furrows.
As he
hears a faraway RUMBLING SOUND...
57
57
Dr. Hogenmiller's house. Small. Simple. Built on a huge
rock promontory overlooking the city. Three DEMOLITION
ROBOTS rolling towards it. Huge, mashing, sporting massive
HYDRAULIC POUNDERS.
Spooner's CAR. SCREECHES to a stop. He jumps out. Races
over to the nearest machine. Looking around -- no people.
SPOONER
(to Robot)
What are you doing?!
A SCREEN. Blinks to life on the hulking chassis.
A
disembodied VOICE...
DEMOLITION ROBOT
Demolition ordered...
SPOONER
Who authorised this?
DEMOLITION ROBOT
Demolition ordered...
Spooner reaches into his coat.
Pulling out his POLICE BADGE.
Scans it over the screen.
51.
SPOONER
Override. This is police business.
Vacate the premises immediately.
DEMOLITION ROBOT
(beat)
Affirmative.
The screen. Blinks off.
Spooner.
Eyeing it.
Turns and
heads for the house.
58
62
...He pours them out into the open. The POUNDERS. Going at
the house like hyenas at a corpse. Roof tiles, beams,
plaster, flooring. SNAPPING and CRACKING as Spooner and the
cat skitter down the carnage.
Heart pounding, breath jagged, face bloodied, Spooner
scrambles away from the POUNDERS. Their bodies GLEAMING in
the dusk sun. The III Laws Safe logo, splashed along their
sides...
Spooner.
Drops the cat.
63
67
Spooner walking along the monorail plaza. Looking a little
worse for wear. PEOPLE. Giving him wide berth. ROBOTS.
Bidding him:
ROBOT
Good morning...
Spooner, shooting them suspicious looks.
As the MONORAIL
pulls up...
CUT TO:
68
77
Spooner stepping out onto the platform, pulling the Homeless
Man along with him. COMMUTERS pour out around them.
As the train pulls off with a WHOOSH. The Homeless Man.
Backs away from Spooner. Grinning insanely. Pointing.
HOMELESS MAN
Why are you protecting them, man?
(short pause)
They were talking about you!
A CHILL. Ripping up Spooner's spine. As he watches the
Homeless Man. Wander down the platform.
Tries. To shake off the feeling. As he turns. To wait for
the next train. Suddenly realising. That he's ALONE on the
platform. Watches. A huge DIGITAL CLOCK. Ticking off
seconds. Sees. CAMERAS in every corner.
Then that feeling. At the back of his neck. He turns and
spots. A couple MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Carrying luggage. Onto
the platform. Then more COMMUTERS show up. Waiting. For
the next train. More MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Following them.
Spooner. Steps up to the platform's edge.
Craning to see.
The approaching TRAIN...
WHEN SUDDENLY. He feels a sharp SHOVE. At the back of his
knee. His shoe, slipping. Arms. Flailing as he...
61.
PITCHES OVER THE EDGE ONTO THE TRACK. People CRYING OUT as
the TRAIN gets closer. Spooner. Whips his head around.
Seeing...
A MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Looking down at him from the platform.
Suitcase in hand.
The MAGNETIC-LEVITATING TRAIN. Right on him. Spooner.
Flips onto his back. Flattening himself. As much as he can.
Clenching his fists. Bracing himself as...
THE TRAIN SCREAMS OVER HIM. The sound, DEAFENING. The force
of the wind. Whipping his tie. His coat. There's nothing,
for him to hold on to. As his legs start to rise off the
track. Caught up. In the VORTEX. Spooner starts sliding.
Along the track...
Gritting his teeth...there's nothing he can do. Getting
sucked towards...the air DOWNTAKE...at the center of the
track. The city...yawning hundreds of feet...below...
78
78
THE EXPRESS TRAIN.
Speeding along.
Then with a WHOOSH it's
gone.
THE TRACK. Empty. No Spooner. Anywhere. Human COMMUTERS.
Stunned. Horrified. Start calling. For help.
The MAINTENANCE ROBOT.
Turns, disappearing into the crowd.
79
79
CLOSE ON a HAND. Hanging onto the track's edge. It's
SPOONER. Dangling. Straining. To get another hand hold
but...
HE SLIPS. His coat ballooning. As he plummets.
Down...
down...down...towards the city...
WHEN SNAP! He's caught. By a cable net. Spooner. Grabbing
onto it. Sweat, pouring down his face. He turns and sees...
THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT
Hurrying down a circular stairwell.
Exiting the station.
ANGER AND DETERMINATION. Flash across Spooner's eyes. As he
hoists himself up. Climbing up the net. Back to the...
80
80
...Track.
Reaching up and clambering back onto...
62.
81
81
...The platform. COMMUTERS. SCREAMING at the sight of him.
A couple SECURITY GUARDS. Rushing towards him...
Spooner. Getting to his feet. Shoving them out of the way
as he starts running. Towards...
THOSE SAME CIRCULAR STAIRS.
Looks over the edge and spots...
THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT.
Down at STREET LEVEL.
Getting away.
Spooner. Looks around. Spots a LIGHT POLE.
Paralleling the
stairs. Takes a step back and...
LEAPS OUT ONTO THE POLE. Hooking his arm around it. Sliding
down like a fireman's pole. Gaining speed when THUMP! His
shoes hit pavement...
82
82
The Maintenance Robot.
Turning a corner.
Down a quiet
street...
SPOONER (O.S.)
Stop!
Swivels round. SPOONER. Running up behind it. Whipping out
his gun. Aiming it at the Robot's head. The Robot. Takes a
step backwards...
SPOONER
I said stop!
The Robot. SUDDENLY swinging the suitcase around. SMASHING
it against Spooner's head. Spooner. Buckles. Falling to
the ground. Managing to squeeze off a SHOT...
The Robot. Deflecting the bullet. With the case.
Raising
it as if to club Spooner with it when...
BAM! Spooner fires a second shot. Piercing the Robot's
breastplate. HYDRAULIC FLUID. Starting to leak. The Robot.
Doesn't hesitate. SLAMS the case into Spooner's face...
BLOOD. Spurting from Spooner's nose. As he fires the gun.
At the fleeing Robot. Gets to his feet. Unsteady. Taking
chase...
83
83
...back out onto the Public Plaza.
Sees the Robot heading
towards a set of...
63.
ESCALATED STAIRS. The Robot. Judging the height. LUNGES
into the air and lands on a STAIR. Denting it. Reaches the
bottom. DISAPPEARING. Into a CROWD of even more PEOPLE...
Spooner. Racing down the stairs. Taking them. Four at a
time. Hits the ground running. Looking. EVERYWHERE.
Suddenly losing track. Of where the Robot went...
Then. Catching sight. JUST AHEAD. Of a ROBOT.
Staring
back at him. Holding SOMETHING. In its HAND...
Spooner.
Plunges into the crowd.
Waving his GUN.
SPOONER
Everyone out of the way!
SCREAMING. PEOPLE SCATTERING. As BAM! BAM! Spooner fires.
Hitting the Robot in its head and back. It drops to the
ground. Spooner. Racing over to it. Sees. It's not the
same Robot. In its hand, a specialised SCREWDRIVER...
OWNER
What the hell do you think you're
doing?!...
Its OWNER. Rushing over. Shoving Spooner aside. But
Spooner's. Not listening. Spotting. A DROP OF HYDRAULIC
FLUID nearby...
Lunges forward.
Following.
The drops.
Running faster.
And
faster...
OWNER
Hey!
...Through the CROWD. POLICE SIRENS. In the background.
As
Spooner. Shoves through. Tracking those drops. Like a
bloodhound. Turns...
84
86
Lt. Bergin. Standing outside Spooner's hospital room. Turns
and looks through the window at him thrashing on the bed...
SPOONER
I want to talk to a human being!
87
88
Spooner walking across the Plaza.
The SUN.
Burgeoning on
the horizon. Comes to...
The ESCALATOR the Maintenance 10 jumped down. Stares down.
At the steps. Waiting. To see the DENTED ONE. Nothing.
68.
89
89
Heads down the ALLEY, where he chased the robot. Studying
the ground. For any hydraulic fluid. Nothing. The
concrete, scrubbed clean.
Spooner.
Rubs his hands over his face.
90
93
The SOUND of a TREMENDOUS CRASH. As we survey a trail of
twisted metal and debris. Only vaguely suggesting the
remains of two CARS...
CLOSE ON one of the wrecks. SPOONER lies trapped at the
center of a distorted mass of metal. No room to move. HIS
RIGHT ARM, TRAPPED...
SPOONER (V.O.)
My right arm was trapped. But I
could hear an ambulance in the
distance. I knew they'd have the
jaws of life...
We hear SIRENS in the distance. Spooner. Trying to remain
calm. As he spots. An ELECTRICAL FIRE. Licking up from the
crumpled hood...
SPOONER (V.O.)
Then I heard it...
VOICE (O.S.)
You are in danger...
That voice. We've heard it before. From his nightmare.
Spooner. Craning to see, through the jagged opening that
used to be his WINDSHIELD. The outline of a ROBOT appearing.
Eye lenses glowing...
70.
ROBOT
You are in danger...
Spooner stares up at the Robot. Not sure how to react.
The
sound of SIRENS. Rushing closer...
The ROBOT.
Starts SMASHING away at the glass...
SPOONER
No!
Halt! Halt!
Spooner.
Trying frantically to pull his arm free. Twisting.
Tugging.
As the Robot's METAL HANDS reach in for him...
ROBOT
You are in danger...
CUT BACK TO:
94
95
The massive facade of U.S. Robotics looming against the dusk
sky. The giant ROBOT STATUE lit up inside.
96
96
Calvin, leading Spooner to a SIDE ENTRANCE. Looks around.
Then scans her I.D. The door. Slides open.
97
101
Spooner. Walking across the Plaza. Throwing a look over his
shoulder. At the LOOMING U.S.R. facade.
Pulls Sonny's DRAWING. Out of his pocket. Looks down at it.
Shaking his head. Passes a TRASH CAN. And drops it in.
Continues on. Hands in his pockets. When...
He STOPS. Something.
Occurring to him.
Turns back to the
trash can just as...
A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW's about to up-end it into a bin...
SPOONER
No!...
He trots back. Plucking the drawing. Out of the can.
Turns
it upside down. Seeing it. From a new perspective.
SPOONER
(echoing Sonny)
"The place where robots meet."
Looks just like a MAP.
102
Spooner emerges from the underground tunnel to the OUTSKIRTS
of the city. A sprawling INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND in the rolling
hills.
The dashboard GPS again displaying the TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP.
103
103
Spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind
him. He slows down. Driving cautiously. The landscape
around him, desolate. Like the drawing.
THE GPS SCREEN shows his car, a WHITE SPOT.
Entering a RED
ZONE. His destination.
Spooner brakes.
Pulls out his GUN.
And...
78.
104
104
...steps out of the car. Trying. To take it all in.
Something about the place. Unnerving. A low HUM.
Permeating the air.
He spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car.
Shining a
FLASHLIGHT on it. Trying to get his bearings.
That HUM. Coming from nearby. On the other side. Of a
burned-out HILL. Spooner. Heads over. Starts cresting it.
As we WIDEN TO FIND...
105
105
...MASSIVE POWER LINES. Running from horizon to horizon.
Spooner slides down some loose shale. Begins to walk along
the line. ELECTRICITY. CRACKLING in the air.
He squints. Into the darkness. Nothing around him. Until.
He hears. Something. The GRATING. Of MECHANICAL JOINTS.
He stops. Not sure. If that's what he heard.
Not moving.
A muscle. When he hears. The sound again.
Behind him.
Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees...
GLOWING EYES.
Appear.
Then recede.
Into the darkness.
SPOONER
Police!
Show yourself!
Nothing. Then. That sound again.
Of metallic joints.
As a
ROBOT. Suddenly emerges...
SPOONER
Come out where I can see you!
ANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light. Spooner, pointing
his gun at one robot. Then the other. Then...
A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR.
Surrounding him.
They start
moving towards him...
Spooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave.
Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES.
The shot ECHOING through the night...
The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM,
hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with
a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came.
79.
Spooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him.
The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some
RUSTED MACHINERY.
Spooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop
JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening.
Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A
laugh of loathing and self-pity.
Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him.
HYBRID ROBOT
Welcome home...ZZZ...sir.
How...ZZZ was your day?...
SPOONER
Great. I'm in a junkyard.
(into the air)
"A place where robots meet." A
place where I'm losing my mind!
HYBRID ROBOT
Very good...ZZZ...sir...
Spooner. Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A
ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him.
Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving
like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a
moment. Disturbed...
When. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT.
Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar
about it.
Spooner. Pulls out Sonny's drawing. A landscape with the
same strangely-shaped building to one side.
106
106
Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure. Sees a
dead electronic SIGN that reads: "JIFFY DATA STORAGE."
Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt.
Spooner tries the door.
Stuck.
Uses his shoulder and...
107
110
Spooner, weaving in and out of traffic. The speedometer,
kissing 200 mph. His hand. Clutching the NAMEPLATE...
84.
WINDSHIELD TELEVISION
...will be destroyed in 45 minutes.
Dr. Lance Robertson, President and
CEO of U.S. Robotics will be
personally overseeing the
execution...
Spooner.
Stabbing out a number.
On his PHONE...
CUT TO:
111
112
SLAMS down his phone.
SPOONER
Dammit!
113
113
The CAR shoots down a ramp into a tunnel system.
114
115
Spooner's eyes. Flicking up to the rearview. Catching, the
transport truck. Coming closer. When. It splits off.
Revealing a SECOND TRANSPORT TRUCK.
Spooner's brow, furrows. As the first truck, begins
overtaking his car on the right. He looks over. As the
truck. Comes up alongside him...
THE SECOND TRUCK...coming up on the left...
85.
116
116
The two TRUCKS. Racing along at over 200. Sandwiching
Spooner's car. Pulling in...closer...closer...
Squeezing Spooner's car like a tin can...
CUT TO:
117
118
Jesus Christ. Spooner's hands. Squeezing the steering
wheel. As the car. Starts VIBRATING. From the pressure.
He keeps looking, to the left...to the right...when...
119
119
The trucks. Suddenly lay off. Pulling out. The First
truck. Speeding forward. The Second, dropping back...
120
120
Spooner. Watching them. Unsure.
Of what they're doing.
Jamming the accelerator. To 230.
To try. And get away from
them. When he sees...up ahead...
121
121
The FIRST TRUCK. Pivoting on its specially designed
SPHERICAL WHEELS. Suddenly traveling lengthwise...
122
122
SWEAT. Springing to Spooner's brow. As he looks in the
rearview mirror. The SECOND TRUCK's, done the same thing.
Coming up closer...and closer...
123
123
The trucks. Planning to CRUSH him between their massive
weights...The U.S.R. Logo...advancing...like some bad joke...
CUT TO:
86.
124
125
BAM! The back truck SLAMS into Spooner. Jolting him in his
seat. As...BAM! The FIRST TRUCK, SMASHES into him from the
front. No way out. As metal GRINDS...TWISTS...and SCREECHES
...bits of the car...TEARING off...
The FIRST TRUCK...backs off...a split second...allowing
Spooner...to spot...up ahead...a small GAP...at the curve of
the tunnel wall...
126
126
GRINDING the gears Spooner's car accelerates...just
zipping...past the front truck...up and around...the concave
tunnel wall...and back onto...a clear stretch of highway...
The TRUCKS. Swiveling back around. To face forward again.
Their massive bodies. Catching up to Spooner...
127
127
Spooner...seeing them...gaining on him...the speedometer...
reaching 275...up ahead...
THE TUNNEL...splitting off into two. Spooner. Heading
towards the LEFT TUNNEL...the TRUCKS...right on his
tail...when...
HE WRENCHES THE WHEEL...switching to the RIGHT tunnel at the
last possible second...
87.
128
128
...The first U.S.R. Truck CRASHING into the divider...jack-
knifing and KABOOM! EXPLODING against the tunnel ceiling...
129
129
Spooner. Watching the ball of FIRE in his rearview mirror.
His car. Badly battered. Metal CRUNCHING. Tires
SCREECHING...
Spooner.
Holding on. As his car. Continues to break up.
Listing.
Rocking. Bits and pieces. Flying off. When it
finally.
Comes to a stop.
Spooner's shoulders, slump.
Then.
He hears a RUMBLING
sound. Turns around...
The SECOND U.S.R. TRUCK.
Barreling towards him...
Spooner. Trapped. Like a nightmare.
Desperately.
Starts
KICKING at the windshield. No go...
The TRUCK.
Racing towards him...
Spooner lunges his weight.
Into the side door.
Giving it.
Everything he's got...
The TRUCK...getting closer...closer...its engine...ROARING...
The side door.
Finally gives.
Spooner pours out...
130
130
...Limping to the side as...The TRUCK SLAMS into his
car...erupting...into another huge EXPLOSION...
The impact...hurtling Spooner...into the adjacent TUNNEL...
He crashes...against concrete...looking up...suddenly
realising...he's in the middle of four lanes of traffic...
CARS...racing by...at mind-numbing speeds...Spooner's
coat...whipping...Spooner...trying...to keep his balance...as
he spies...
A MAINTENANCE DOOR across the way.
Has no choice.
Takes a
deep breath and...
MAKES A DASH ACROSS THE LANES...the cars' SENSORS...causing
them to swerve...SCREECHING...BEEPING...Spooner...just making
it...to the other side...
88.
Wrenching open.
The maintenance door...
CUT TO:
131
132
Spooner. Spilling out from below ground. Onto a public
Plaza. Exhausted. Battered. Spins around to get his
bearings.
The U.S. ROBOTICS COMPLEX rises above the old undistinguished
buildings. Blocks away. Many blocks away.
Spooner.
Checks his watch.
Then breaks into a run...
CUT TO:
133
141
As the entire COMPLEX shuts down for the night.
Non-
essential LIGHTS, blinking off.
An NS-2, opening a limousine door for Robertson.
He looks
around then gets in. It drives away.
EMPTY hallways, offices, labs. Building ROBOTS stand at
rest. Non-functional during off-hours. Like metal statues.
You can hear a pin drop.
142
156
Full power is suddenly restored inside and out. LIGHTS
coming on all at once. ALARMS SCREAMING throughout the
complex.
157
159
Spooner, Calvin and Sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way
MAINTENANCE EXIT. All looking the worse for wear. Spooner.
Turns to Sonny.
SPOONER
Why'd you come back, Sonny? I
thought you weren't programmed with
the Three Laws.
108.
SONNY
Let's just say I wrote some of my
own laws today, Detective: a robot
must protect a friend from
harm...as long as he's not a
complete asshole.
Spooner smiles.
SPOONER
Well, that's certainly a start,
Sonny.
Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.
SONNY
Sonny.
You called me Sonny.
SPOONER
Don't get used to it.
Sonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then
takes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a
HANDSHAKE.
SONNY
Detective Spooner, I...
SPOONER
(anticipating)
Let's just save the thanks, okay?
Sonny nods.
Looks out at the city scape.
SONNY
I don't know what I'm going to do
now.
SPOONER
Good -- That's one of the perks of
freedom.
Sonny looks at him. Grateful. Looks at Calvin. Then
hesitates. Turns. And hurries off across the Plaza.
Calvin and Spooner.
Watching them go.
SPOONER
You're going to have a hell of a
time explaining this.
109.
CALVIN
Don't worry. I have a feeling that
U.S. Robotics will be needing my
services very badly in the future.
She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile. Then
suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS. Spooner, completely
surprised.
CALVIN
I am the only robo-psychologist
around.
She turns on her heel and heads back inside.
Spooner smiles.
160
Sonny walking along deserted streets.
Looking over his
shoulder. Keeping in the shadows.
110.
SPOONER (V.O.)
Victor thought that by letting your
robot exist, I'd be condemning the
human race as we know it to
extinction.
HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
Bah. Sounds like nonsense. But
why are you so worried? We will
both be dead long before then --
161
161
Sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside.
HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
Oh, what am I saying? I am dead
already!
162
162
Sonny steps onto the grounds of the JUNKYARD. The power
lines above him, surging with energy. He walks past the
burned-out husks of industrial machinery.
Then we hear it. The SOUND of MECHANICAL JOINTS. Getting
louder and louder. And just as before, a BROKEN-DOWN ROBOT
emerges into the dawn light. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.
But not quite like before. The robots aren't teetering.
Aren't lumbering. They keep on coming. Their bent and
broken bodies, straightening out as...
DOZENS of ROBOTS rise up. Slowly. Gathering around in a
large circle. As they all turn to look at:
SONNY'S SILHOUETTE. Slowly climbing to the top of the hill.
Looking out at the vast junkyard below.
CLOSE ON SONNY. Standing proud and defiant. The SUN,
creeping over the horizon. A new day filled with infinite
possibilities.
The robots.
Staring up at him.
Eager for what comes next.
