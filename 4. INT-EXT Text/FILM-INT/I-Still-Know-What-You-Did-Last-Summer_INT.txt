The setting sun backlights a series of abstract colored images. Holy
images of STAINED GLASS and lead.
FOOTSTEPS ECHO across the marble floor.
REVEAL - JULIE JAMES
A little older, a little wiser, yet still very pretty, no doubt. But
she's all alone in the house of the Lord.
And those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden
still rests upon her soul.
She reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained
CONFESSIONAL BOOTH.
Julie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters, kneeling before
the CLOSED SCREEN. A beat -- and the SCREEN SLIDES OPEN.
A PRIEST
enters the adjacent booth -- barely visible through the WICKER MESH.
Julie looks down, crosses herself, and begins.
JULIE
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
(a beat)
It's been a year since my last
confession...
Julie swallows hard. This is difficult for her.
JULIE (cont'd)
I've never told anyone this. Not my
mom, not the poice, not even my
friends -- except for the ones who
were there and they...well they're
not around anymore. You see I...I...
PRIEST
Yes?
JULIE
I killed a man. Well, I thought I
had...then...
She balks at the memory of it. The priest bows his head in the shadows
of the other side.
JULIE (cont'd)
(emotional)
You've got to understand...It was
all an accident. A terrible accident.
It's been a whole year. I've tried to
get past this, but I just can't.
PRIEST
Go on...
JULIE
I have these dreams...horrible
dreams. And this man is always there
with me.
PRIEST
(reassuring)
I know...
JULIE
You see, he was a killer. He
murdered Helen and Barry, and he
would have killed me too, if I
hadn't...gotten away with it.
(regathering)
I don't know, I guess I just need to
deal with the fear, the guilt...to
finally say his name. Ben Willis. His
name was Ben Willis...
The confession is cathartic for Julie. She looks relieved until,
PRIEST
I know...
Julie stops. Looks through the screen. A chill shoots through her
body.
JULIE
You know? But how could you...
Clouds of icy steam shoot through the partition. Julie moves closer to
the screen, trying to get a better look.
PRIEST
(growls)
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!!!
A STEEL HOOK
smashes through the screen right in Julie's face! She SCREAMS!
SMASH CUT TO:
Still screaming -- Julie jumps back, seemingly knocked out of her
chair. She fights the unseen demon.
Sitting beside her, Julie's friend WILL BENSON reacts. He's a good-
looking kid in a shy, humble kind of way. And he tries to help her,
but she's too busy turning ten shades of red.
The PROFESSOR lowers his glasses, makes it even worse.
PROFESSOR
Nice to see you find Political
Science so stimulating --
The lecture hall erupts with laughter.
JULIE
I'm sorry --
Julie grabs her stuff and bolts.
CUT TO:
Julie opens the door and steps inside. She locks three deadbolts. She
stands there, alone, listening to the SILENCE. She doesn't even have a
cat. A faucet DRIPS in the kitchen.
The faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the
lock on each window. She stands for a moment.
She picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge
and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and
a jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf.
She thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet.
She takes the whole mess toward her bedroom.
She hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely
furnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the
windows, then climbs into bed with the food.
On the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at
one of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing.
Outside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going
places. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns
off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the
room.
DISSOVE TO:
Julie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed.
There's a CLICK in the front hall. And ANOTHER.
Julie's eyes shoot open. She listens. Another SOUND, almost like the
front door being CLOSED.
Her arm reaches for the bedside light. She hits the switch. The bulb
POPS.
JULIE
(whispers)
Okay. Okay. Face your fears...
She gets off the bed and stands still.
JULIE (cont'd)
(whisper)
There's nothing...
There's another NOISE down the hall.
JULIE (cont'd)
(whisper)
Quiet.
Julie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen.
She gets a large KNIFE. She listens. It sounds like somone's in the
living room. She steps through the kitchen door.
As she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway
toward her bedroom.
There's NO ONE there.
JULIE (cont'd)
Okay, calm down, imagination.
She relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly AJAR, light
from the hallway slanting through.
JULIE (cont'd)
I can't take this anymore. I can't.
Holding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway. There's
a soft RUSTLING coning from her bedroom. She gets a flashlight out of
a drawer and starts down the hallway.
JULIE (cont'd)
(fatalistic)
Let's just do it.
She moves faster toward her bedroom. she listens outside the doorway.
It sounds like someone's in the closet. She moves into the room.
There's a noise in the darkened closet. Julie moves into position.
She turns the flashlight ON and lunges for the closet.
INT THE CLOSET
KARLA WILSON, 19, all grace and attitude, is on tiptoes reaching for a
box of shoes. She SCREAMS.
Julie SCREAMS. They both SCREAM together. Julie drops the knife and
flashlight.
KARLA
I thought you were out of town!
JULIE
What are you doing in my closet?
They hug, jumping up and down with relief.
KARLA
I thought you were out of town!
JULIE
What are you doing in my closet?
KARLA
i just wanted your black pants, but
I'm not ready to die for them!
Julie turns on the light in the hallway. Karla has her shoes in her
hand and black pants draped over her arm.
JULIE
That was heart attack time, Karla.
KARLA
No. When I put these skinny pants on
my body...Now, that's heart attack
time.
Karla looks down and sees the knife. She picks it up with two
fingers --
KARLA (cont'd)
And we're going to put away the
utensils and you're coming with me.
Julie flops down on her bed.
JULIE
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat,
ugly, and depressed.
KARLA
Yeah, right -- whatever.
JULIE
I think I just really hurt Ray's
feelings.
KARLA
(keeping it upbeat)
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great
guy, nothing against old Ray, but
he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in
Southport. Will's a nice guy, too,
and he lives right down the street.
Karla picks up the flashlight and goes into the closet.
JULIE
There's nothing between Will and me.
KARLA (V.O.)
Yet. Nothing yet.
She emerges with clothes for Julie. Holds up one outfit.
KARLA (cont'd)
What we gotta do is keep moving. No
time to mope. I'm working at the
club tonight. And you, dancing queen,
are coming with me.
JULIE
No I'm not.
Karla holds up another dress for Julie -- strapless, sexy, the one.
KARLA
Fine, then be fat, ugly, and
depressed.
Karla is dancing around. Julie laughs at her friend and takes the
dress when Karla hands it to her.
CUT TO:
It's a hopping college joint: crowded, loud MUSIC, a dance floor, and
rivers of cheap booze.
AT THE BAR
Julie sits next to Karla as she waits for her drink order.
A handsome young man slides in front of them. This is TYRELL MARTIN,
23, handsome, no pretention, a little dangerous, with a killer smile.
TYRELL
You know what I want to do to you
...right now, don't you? There's
gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
KARLA
(playful)
I don't think so. It's pretty
crowded.
TYRELL
Just for a minute, baby. I got
something I wanna tell you.
He's looking for a dark corner or a storeroom or something.
KARLA
(teasing)
If you can say all you gotta say
in a minute then I don't wanna hear
it.
TYRELL
I'll talk real slow.
He's kissing her ear. She starts to giggle.
The bartender sets down drinks on Karla's tray.
KARLA
(re: Julie)
Ask her to dance.
Tyrell hesitates.
KARLA (cont'd)
Go on.
Karla cuts away through the crowd, delivering drinks. Tyrell turns to
Julie.
TYRELL
You're the most beautiful woman
in the bar tonight, Jules.
JULIE
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable
force of nature.
TYRELL
That's right. It's how the species
survives. You'll never convince me
otherwise.
(beat)
Wanna dance?
Karla passes by --
KARLA
Say yes.
JULIE
No.
KARLA
No means yes.
JULIE
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have
you seen my people dance? We make
the mouth face, we move the
fingers --
TYRELL
(heading for the floor)
Worse comes to worse, you can stand
there and watch me.
KARLA
Come on, I'll take a break and
we'll all dance.
is packed and thumping. Karla is dancing her way through the crowd.
Tyrell and Julie follow behind her.
Karla sees Will. He's dressed up and nervous. She smiles.
KARLA (cont'd)
Whaddayou know? Will Benson lookin'
fine.
JULIE
(suspicious, but
having fun)
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
KARLA
Nope. I told him that you
absolutely, positively would not be
here at this bar between ten o'clock
and eleven o'clock tonight. And then
he came anyway.
WILL
(shy to a fault)
This was not my idea.
JULIE
What?
WILL
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
Will looks down at his feet. He and Julie stand there not quite
knowing what to do.
TYRELL
Where I come from, you want to
snatch the goodies, you got to at
least talk to them first.
Tyrell and Karla go for it on the dance floor, leaving Will and Julie
alone. They look at each other. They look at everyone dancing.
WILL
How about a drink?
Will is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar. Julie seems to be
relaxing, having a good time. Then, she looks up into the balcony and
sees, in a strobe light's FLASH --
SOMEONE IN A SLICKER
watching her intently. She squints for a better look, but he's gone.
WILL
(yelling over the din)
You okay?
She's chalk white and crestfallen. Her whole affect is "Will I ever
have a normal time?" She drifts amay toward the stairs to the balcony.
WILL (cont'd)
Hey Julie?
Will catches Karla and Tyrell's eyes. They're worried.
Julie catches another glimps of THE SLICKER.
She pushes her way through the crowd up the stairs.
Julie looks all around -- finally spotting the MAN IN THE SLICKER from
behind, making his way to the other side.
He slices through a crowd of students, and Julie keeps following. He
turns down a service corridor.
Julie follows, frightened, but unable to resist.
She catches him at the end of the corridor. She reaches out and grabs
the stranger's arm.
JULIE
Ben...
The stranger turns around. It's only a club kid in a tacky vinyl
raincoat and hat. She's shaken.
SLICKER GUY
Hye, baby. You following me up
here?
(a come-on)
Well, all right.
Julie turns away and hurries down the hallway. Todd follows, but his
figure quickly fades.
CUT TO:
With morning sun filtering through her blinds, Julie wakes up to the
strange sound of THUMPING. She gets out of bed and slowly exits the
room.
The noise gets louder as she heads down the hall.
ANGLE ON A CLOSET
The noise is at its loudest -- Julie reaches for a doorknob -- and
yanks open the door.
ANGLE ON A CLOTHES DRYER
rocking and banging inside the closet. Julie frowns.
Julie spins, once again startled by Karla, who crosses to the dryer,
flipping open the lid and then jumping back to catch the shoes as they
pop out on the fly.
JULIE
(still sleepy)
That could break the machine.
KARLA
Julie, people who end up making
rules like that end up beating
their kids with wire hangers. It's
a fact.
The phone RINGS. Karla looks at her watch.
KARLA (cont'd)
It's Tyrell.
JULIE
(resigned)
The number's unlisted...
KARLA
Would you relax? We've been dating
three months. He ain't stalking
your butt.
JULIE
Okay, okay. You're right.
KARLA
I know it, and it feels good.
(answering the phone)
Hi, Ty.
A DJ for a local radio station BOOMS from the phone.
MARK (V.O.)
This is Mark in the Morning for
Magic 96.7 Radio Station! Who am I
speaking with?
Julie watches her friend get excited.
KARLA
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh
my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.
(to Julie)
Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
MARK (V.O.)
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at
home over the long fourth weekend?
KARLA
Well, I'm in school and --
MARK (V.O.)
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7
Quicky Getaway?
KARLA
Yes!
Julie hits the SPEAKERPHONE BUTTON and Karla hangs up. The DJ's voice
echos through the appartment.
MARK (V.O.)
Good, then I hope you remember your
geography, Karla, because all you
have to do to win is tell me the
capital of Brazil.
Karla's smile abruptly fades.
KARLA
(into phone)
Brazil? Um...
She looks to Julie, whose face is as blank as hers.
KARLA (cont'd)
You don't know?! You have to know.
You know everything...
MARK
C'mon, Karla, one easy question,
one great getaway!
JULIE
(shrugs)
...South America...Carnival...
MARK (V.O.)
Karla, we need an answer. No
looking it up.
KARLA
Still here...thinking...
(stalling)
You mean Brazil, the country?
MARK (V.O.)
Okay, Karla, five seconds.
(counting down)
Five...Four...
Julie has an idea. She scramles for the kitchen. Grabs a BAG OF FRESH-
GROUND COFFEE from the FREEZER.
MARK (cont'd, V.O.)
Three...Two...
Julie tosses the bag across the room to Karla. Karla reads the label:
RIO BLEND -- 100% BRAZILIAN COFFEE.
KARLA
(blurting)
Rio de Janeiro!
MARK (V.O.)
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
KARLA
(wincing)
No. Yes?
BELLS and WHISTLES and triumphant MUSIC.
MARK (V.O.)
You just won Magic 96.7's Quickie
Getaway...a trip for four to Tower
Bay Island in the fabulous Bahamas.
Karla and Julie jump up and down ecstatically.
KARLA
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
MARK (V.O.)
We'll call you back with all the
details...So what's your favorite
radio station?
KARLA AND JULIE
Magic 96.7!
Julie hangs up and joins Karla dancing on the couch.
KARLA
I won. I won...I won, I won, I won.
(teasing)
Now, let's see...There's Tyrell,
that's one. And, there's my parents
...And I got some cousins.
(beat)
Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark
said four tickets. That means you
gotta get yourself a date.
Julie thinks, she seems torn.
CUT TO:
The music's even LOUDER in here. The mood is high...Two buddies going
to propose to a girl. Dave adjusts the radio to another AM station --
DAVE
Man, I love AM radio. You got
right-wing conspiracy, tips for
pregnant womem, Single-A baseball
games, and real country music...
None of that new crap...
He adjusts the dial again, tuning in a country song, "MAMAS, DON'T LET
YOUR BABIES GROW UP TO BE COWBOYS," by Waylon Jennings and Willie
Nelson.
Dave starts singing along, extra LOUD and out of tune.
DAVE (cont'd)
(singing)
"...Mamas, don't let your babies grow
up to be cowboys, don't let 'em pick
guitars and drive them old trucks. Let
'em be doctors and lawyers and such."
Ray looks at his goofy friend singing and starts to get a little happy
himself...
Then, Ray sees something in the road ahead. He turns down the radio.
They both stare --
RAY'S POV: A CAR TURNED SIDEWAYS
its HAZARDS blinking.
Ray slows and creeps past the car. The driver's door is open. It
appears EMPTY.
A BODY
is sprawled out in the road away from the car. Ray pulls over to the
shoulder and stops.
DAVE
(nervous)
I don't know, man. Maybe we should
keep going, find a phone --
RAY
No.
DAVE
The guy looks dead.
Ray has seen this before --
RAY
Maybe not.
He throws open his door.
Dave watches Ray in the road. He leans across the seat and rolls up
Ray's window.
Behind him, the SLICKER FIGURE gets closer, moving to the passenger
side of the truck.
Something FLASHES IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRROR.
A nearly empty jet. Karla has her head on Tyrell's shoulder. Julie is
reading a book.
Will's knuckles are white from gripping the armrests in fear, and his
eyes are clenched shut. Julie looks on with concern.
JULIE
Just take deep breaths and think of
something happy from childhood.
WILL
What if I don't have anything happy
from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax
going five hundred miles an hour, or
four thousand, four hundred feet a
minute...
(calculating)
Which is over seven hundred feet a
second. Imagine hitting something at
seven hundred feet a second.
JULIE
Deep breaths --
WILL
(no deep breaths)
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks.
You can by surface-to-air missiles
over the internet. Planes use
O-rings...which freeze in tap water.
Planes fall from the sky for
practically no reason at all.
JULIE
You've got a better chance of
getting hit by lightning.
WILL
Right. Planes get hit by lightning.
They get hit by meteors. They hit
other planes.
Tyrell shakes his head.
TYRELL
(exasperated)
Something is gonna hit your butt if
you don't quit complaining.
KARLA
(sypathetic)
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Will doesn't move, frozen with fear of flying, but more closely bonded
with the concerned Julie.
CUT TO:
The hotel is tastefully appointed with island decor. AN ORNATE METAL
STAIRCASE leads UP to the ROOMS -- and DOWN (AS THE SIGN SAYS) TO A
FITNESS CENTER.
In one direction, the foyer meets the entrance to a tropical
RESTAURANT/BAR. And in the other, A LOOBY LOUNGE is visible --
surrounded by four walls of BOOKS and HOTEL MEMORABILIA.
In a dark corner of the room, a uniformed MAID named OLGA dusts off a
massive WOODEN GLOBE.
Julie smiles at the woman on their way through the lobby, but Olga
shyly looks away.
Arriving at the FRONT DESK, the four of them find it deserted. They
wait patiently, then impatiently.
ANGLE ON A DESK BELL
as Karla slaps it with her palm. The bell RINGS for a long time then
fades into SILENCE.
KARLA
Hello? Hello?
JULIE
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Julie turns to consult the maid.
ANGLE ON THE GLOBE
The big ball is spinning. But Olga is no longer in sight.
Tyrell heads toward a DOOR beside the counter with a sign which reads:
PRIVATE OFFICE.
TYRELL
I'll scare somebody up.
He grabs the knob and pulls the door open to...
RROWWWR? A PIT BULL ON A CHAIN JUMPS UP INTO HIS FACE -- its toothy
maw snapping shut about a half inch from his nose.
TYRELL (cont'd)
Whoa!
Julie and Karla laugh. Karla goes to hit the bell once more -- ONLY TO
HAVE HER HAND GRABBED IN THE PROCESS.
Karla gasps. Pulls away. We see the hand belongs to the hotel manager
-- BROOKS, balding, 40s, talks slowly, and seems to have secrets he
won't share with guests.
BROOKS
What can I do for you?
KARLA
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Will saunters away to look at the books in the lobby.
BROOKS
(condescending)
Ah, yes. Roll out the red carpet.
Our contest winners are here at
last.
He scans a sheet as Tyrell stares at the pit bull.
TYRELL
Nice dog.
BROOKS
Not really. I've found peices of
guys like you in his stool.
Tyrell is put off by this aggressive comment.
TYRELL
What's your problem, buddy?
BROOKS
(innocent)
I don't have a problem in the world.
JULIE
(covering)
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
BROOKS
(proud)
Built in 1948 for a member of the
Rockefeller clan. The tile work was
imported from Spain. A lot of history
in these walls...Judy Garland stayed
here...Hemmingway fished for marlin
right off that dock --
TYRELL
Okay, we get it...It's old.
BROOKS
It'll outlive you, I'm sure.
Creepy thing to say. Slides a registration form.
BROOKS (cont'd)
Wilson comma Karla...
(sees something on
the form)
Oh --
KARLA
Oh, what?
Brooks covers --
BROOKS
You're in 201 and 202.
KARLA
(expecting this)
Is that bad?
BROOKS
(lying)
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon
suites.
Tyrell wraps his arms around Karla. Julie looks uncomfortably towards
Will.
JULIE
Your what?
BROOKS
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids
haven't exchanged vows, yet?
JULIE
We haven't exchanged anything.
KARLA
Julie, we're talkin' suites!
(excited)
That'll be just fine with us.
BROOKS
And, while you're here, our marginally
trained, off-season staff of five will
attend to your every need.
KARLA
Wait...Did you say off-season?
BROOKS
July fourth weekend. Storm season
starts today. The clouds roll in like
clockwork.
JULIE
Storm season?
BROOKS
It's our version of winter.
(hands over the keys)
201 and 202. There's Scrabble and
Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
And Brooks turns away through the office door. They walk toward their
rooms. Will catches up with them.
CUT TO:
They walk down the hallway. Karla seems annoyed.
KARLA
Ain't nothin' free in this world.
Everybody says it, and it's true.
(dissapointed)
I wanted you all to have a good trip.
TYRELL
We will, baby...All this means is we
got the whole island to ourselves.
WILL
And it's been blue skies all day. It
might be perfect all weekend.
JULIE
It beets being on the mainland.
KARLA
Oooh, the mainland --
TYRELL
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby.
Tropical!
The mood is improving. A SQUEEKING NOISE interupts.
A BRASS LUGGAGE CART has appeared behind them. And ESTES, 60s, the
weary Haitian porter, steps from behind it.
ESTES
(a Carribean accent)
201 and 202...Who put you in...?
(hesitant)
Don't use these much --
JULIE
(suspicious)
Why's that?
He sees their happy, expectant faces and changes the subject.
ESTES
No real reason.
(then)
Pretty fancy rooms for kids your age.
KARLA
We won a competition.
ESTES
Oh, yeah? What you have to do?
TYRELL
Guess the capital of Brazil --
KARLA
Rio, baby!
ESTES
Ahh, good for you, girl.
(waiting for a cue)
...And, where would you like me to
put the bags?
A beat as Julie and Karla exchange a look. Then, Karla tosses one of
the keys to Julie.
KARLA
(to Estes)
Their stuff in there...
(grabbing Tyrell)
...and ours in here.
JULIE
Karla! You promised.
KARLA
(looking at Tyrell)
I also promised Tyrell.
TYRELL
Promised me what, baby?
(joking around)
I made all my promises to William.
Tyrell makes fake goo-goo eyes at Will. Estes looks away.
TYRELL (cont'd)
Sweetie, you brought your nightie,
didn't you?
WILL
Forward! A girl needs time to make up
his mind.
(to Julie, thoughtful)
Julie, look, if it's cool, I'll sleep
on the couch and they can have their
own room to practice for that real
honeymoon.
But Tyrell grabs Karla and drags her into the room. We here GIGGLES.
WILL
I'll take those.
ESTES
No, I've been doing this since before
you were a dream in your father's eye.
Estes grabs the bags and takes them into the room. Julie and Will are
left staring at each other.
WILL
You sure it's okay with you?
JULIE
(noting his sweetness)
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't
snore.
WILL
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets
out of hand.
She laughs and they go into the room.
CUT TO:
BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. Ray is hooked up to a heart monitor. Although he's
asleep, we can tell he's bruised and generally beaten up.
WE RACK to a DOCTOR checking on him through the glass.
We see a COP next to the doctor.
COP
He's beaten up pretty bad --
DOCTOR
Yes, but he seemed certain his friend
was killed out on the highway by
somebody named Ben Willis.
(hisitant)
He said he has a hook on his hand. He
said he was driving a BMW.
As the cop stares at him deadpan, the doctor realizes how rediculous
this must sound.
CLOSE UP: Ray's eyes pop open. He's listening.
The cop explains things to the doctor.
COP
There's no body. And there was no
other vehical involved.
(beat)
He fell asleep at the wheel...and ran
his old truck into a guardrail. He got
thrown way the hell down into a ditch.
He's damn lucky.
They walk back down the ICU.
DOCTOR
(nodding)
He suffered a severe head trauma --
COP
Probably once he rests up, it'll all
come back to him.
The doctor and cop approach the nurse's station. The NURSE is reading
a magazine. She folds it away.
Suddenly, the monitoring equpment goes OFF with a series of LOUD
WARNINGS.
NURSE
(already moving)
That's your number twelve --
The doctor, nurse, and country cop hurry back toward Ray's room.
NURSE (cont'd)
(yelling)
Get me some help down here. We got a
flatline, room twelve.
THEIR POV - THROUGHT THE DOOR
The wires and monitors are unhooked and Ray is GONE.
CUT TO:
A resort bar on the beach. Ocean breezes and surf SOUNDS come through
the window.
It's tiki galore, complete with a bamboo bar and fishing gear hanging
from decorative nets from the ceiling. There's a KARAOKE STAGE in the
corner.
Will and Tyrell enter and head straight to the bar. A bored bar
tender, NANCY, looks just like Jennifer Esposito, doesn't look up from
her paperback.
NANCY
You guys lost?
TYRELL
(re: the emptiness)
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
NANCY
Wanna drink?
WILL
We didn't get all dressed up for
nothing.
TYRELL
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or
how about a Mai-Tai?
NANCY
How about some ID?
They freeze.
NANCY (cont'd)
Kidding.
They nod.
WILL
The guy at the desk said the place would
be quiet, not dead.
NANCY
Didn't anyone tell you this is --
TYRELL
The last day of the season. Yeah, we
heard.
WILL
So why are you still here?
NANCY
That's none of your business.
Tyrell sizes her up quickly.
TYRELL
What's the matter, boy trouble?
NANCY
Not anymore.
TYRELL
He leave you?
NANCY
No. I shot him.
Will and Tyrell exchange a danger-Will-Robinson glance.
NANCY (cont'd)
What you want is a Dark and Stormy:
Vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch
of Tabasco. Sailors drink it for luck
in the hurricane season, trust me.
ACROSS THE BAR
Karla and Julie walk in talking quietly to one another.
JULIE
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great,
and he's cute --
KARLA
He's cute...And he's got a crush on
you...
(off Julie's look)
But...
JULIE
(appologetic)
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Karla looks at her. She's sincere, but firm.
KARLA
Ray made up his own mind...so, you're
free to make up yours.
Joining the men, but continuing her thought --
KARLA (cont'd)
For the next foury-eight hours...
(joking)
Your smile is a frown...turned upside
down.
She illustrates with her own big smile.
TYRELL
Pretty cool bar.
KARLA
They all start to look the same once
you've worked in one.
(to Nancy)
Am I right, sister?
Nancy reaches out a hand and they touch just the tips of their
fingers.
JULIE
(to Nancy)
I'm Julie. This is Karla.
NANCY
Nancy.
(sarcastic)
Welcome to Tower Bay's most happenin'
hotspot.
Nancy continues making their cocktails.
JULIE
backs into something, turns and gasps -- it's a statue of an OLD
WHALER, complete with HARPOON, WHITE BEARD, and YELLOW SLICKER.
She doesn't let Karla see that it upset her.
Nancy puts their drinks down in front of them.
NANCY
Four Dark and Stormies...
They all pick up their drinks.
KARLA
(toasting)
To a great weekend --
WILL
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the
weather!
KARLA & JULIE
I'll drink to that!
They drink and toast again.
KARLA
(to Nancy)
So what do you do around here for fun?
Nancy looks straight at Will --
NANCY
Make fun of tourists mainly.
(beat)
Or let them make fun of themselves...
She flips a switch that lights the Karaoke stage.
KARLA
Karaoke -- perfect.
JULIE
Don't even think about it.
KARLA
Okay, I won't.
She's already heading for the stage.
TYRELL
Go baby! Go!
AT THE STAGE
CLOSE ON the karaoke machine. Karla flips through a binder full of
songs.
KARLA
Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is
for somebody who really needs it.
(finds one)
Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese!
NANCY
(it's true)
Everyone thinks their a singer.
JULIE
No way.
KARLA
Yes.
JULIE
No.
KARLA
Yes.
JULIE
Not me...no way...
WILL
Come on, it'll be fun.
KARLA
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your
hands together for my friend, my very
best friend, Julie James.
But there will be no mercy.
KARLA, TYRELL, & WILL
(chanting in unison)
Ju-lie! Ju-lie! Ju-lie!
Reluctantly she goes to the song book. She sees something
particularily awful.
JULIE
You asked for it.
(to Tyrell)
Song number thirty-nine.
Tyrell nods and punches a few buttons. Julie takes the stage as sappy
strings begin to swell. She looks at the MONITOR, then
melodramatically at the crowd, and begins to sing -- no, BELT --
Gloria Gaynor's "I WILL SURVIVE."
JULIE (cont'd)
(singing)
First I was afraid...I was petrified...
(continues singing under)
Will stands, clapping. Tyrell pounds his chest. Karla flips up her
LIGHTER, swaying like a hard-core fan. And Julie continues, crooning
out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance.
JULIE (cont'd)
(singing)
I will survive...I will survive...
ANGLE ON THE KARAOKE MONITOR
The schmaltzy lyrics keep scrolling by -- white against black. But
then...in the middle of the song...the color changes. RED CAPITAL\
LETTERS BEGIN TO FILL THE SCREEN.
JULIE (cont'd)
(singing --
then trailing off)
And I still know...what you did...
last summer...
Her voice trails. Her smile abruptly fades.
MICROPHONE
falls to the floor. The room echoes with an electronic WHUMP. Everyone
stops dancing, confused.
CLOSE - JULIE
trembling, shaking, a mess. Will jumps onstage.
WILL
Julie? What's wrong?
JULIE
It's...him.
WILL
What do you mean, Julie?
JULIE
He did something to the screen...it,
it, said...
Julie loos at the screen -- the normal lyrics are still scrolling. She
suddenly feels their eyes upon her. They're looking at her like she's
having a nervous breakdown.
JULIE (cont'd)
Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry...
Stung, she rushes off the stage.
KARLA
Julie...
But it's to late. She's bolted from the bar.
CUT TO:
Julie steps into her room. Closes the door behind her. She falls back
against it, trying to calm herself down.
JULIE
There's no way...just stop it right
now...
She looks around the cozy room.
JULIE (cont'd)
Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic.
Julie starts to undress, get ready for bed, the day of travel finally
catching up with her. She grabs something to sleep in. Tosses it on
the bed. And that's when she sees it,
CLOSE - ENVELOPE
propped on the pillows. Her name written across. She is frozen
momentarily.
Almost against her will, she moves toward the envelope. She reaches
down and picks it up.
She hesitates, then opens the envelope. She pulls out a SINGLE WHITE
CARD.
ANGLE ON THE CARD
In bold print it reads: SURPRISE!
DARKFIGURE
appears over Julie's shoulder. Julie can feel the presence. She spins,
scaring --
WILL
who YELLS and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding. The
bottle bursts and covers them with spray.
JULIE
(realizing)
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
WILL
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I
didn't think...
She grabs a TOWEL off the bathroom door, trying to help him clean up
the mess.
JULIE
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
WILL
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
JULIE
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a
little on edge. I'm really sorry.
WILL
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me.
I'm the one. I understand.
(covering the awkwardness)
I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
JULIE
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
He picks up a rose. Most of its petals on the floor.
WILL
I just really like you and I want you to
feel good about everything...You know? I
want you to be happy.
He hands the rose to her. There's a moment between them. He
reluctantly heads for the door.
CUT TO:
Karla bounces playfully on their big bed as Tyrell crosses toward the
windows.
KARLA
Tha's it.
(bounce)
I've decided.
(bounce)
I'm changing my major to finance.
(bounce)
And going to Wall Street.
TYRELL
Why?
KARLA
'Cause that's the only way I'm ever
gonna be able to afford a big bed like
this.
She falls back against the plush comforter, looking up at herself in a
long MIRROR HANGING RIGHT OVER THE BED. Tyrell loves this and quickly
moves beside her in the bed. She lets him get real close, then she
jumps up --
KARLA (cont'd)
Jacuzzi.
Tyrell reaches for her, but she bounces off the bed.
TYRELL
Ah, baby, let's stay right here.
Karla pulls her suit out of a bag and models it seductively and
flirtatiously for Tyrell.
KARLA
I spent a hundred bucks on it...even if
it's just so you can pull it off.
Tyrell gets off the bed --
TYRELL
I like the sound of this.
CUT TO:
In the empty night lobby, behind the desk
THE TELEPHONE
RINGS and RINGS. We push in on the phone RINGING unanswered in the
night. Nobody is around to answer it.
CUT TO:
The DOOR CREAKS OPEN once again to her room. And from a STRANGER'S POV
-- WE SLOWLY CREEP INSIDE.
A CLOUD OF STEAM billows from the open BATHROOM. THE SOUND OF A SHOWER
is heard. We MOVE TOWARD IT.
Eyes closed, Julie stands with her face right under the showerhead,
trying to relax. Something softly goes THUMP.
Julie opens her eyes. Turns off the shower. Stands there, frozen,
listening.
JULIE
(calling out)
Will...?
No reply.
AT THE BATHROOM DOORWAY
In a robe with a towel on her head, Julie peeks into her room. Nobody
there. She sighs, and crosses back to the bathroom sink.
AT THE SINK
Julie looks to a spot where her toothbrush should be. She frowns.
Looks around. Some of her things are missing. She peers into the
fogged-up bathroom mirror.
She whips the TOWEL off her head and WIPES IT ACROSS THE MIRROR,
MAKING THE BEDROOM BEHIND HER VISIBLE.
Ready to spit, she looks down. AND IN THAT INSTANT -- WE SEE A SHADOWY
FIGURE PASS BEHIND HER IN THE BEDROOM. She looks back up...and HE'S
GONE. Julie turns on the water to rinse.
ANGLE ON THE BEDROOM DOOR
as it SLOWLY CREAKS SHUT, the SOUND DROWNED OUT by the SINK.
Julie turns off the water -- and KLUNK-KLUNK -- and NOISE at her door.
The sound STOPS.
She steps out of the bathroom, crossing toward the door.
JULIE
Will?
No answer. She peers through the PEEPHOLE.
JULIE (cont'd)
Is that you?
She unlocks and opens it. Nobody there.
Julie quickly closes the door and relocks it, her heart rate just
begining to rise again as...
KLUNK-KLUNK. She hears it again. Then, the sound STOPS. But standing
at the door -- she realizes that's not where it came from. Her eyes
immediately go to...
THE CLOSET
Damn. That's where it came from. She slowy pads across the room in her
slippers toward the door. Trembling...she reaches for the handle...AND
TUGS IT OPEN!
There's NOTHING. She stares a beat. DRIP DRIP DRIP.
She sees something on the floor of the closet. She touches a finger to
it.
IT'S BLOOD.
She looks up.
THE DOCKHAND
comes dropping down at her, dangling, enmeshed in barbed wire. He's
dying before our eyes. Blood bubbling from his mouth. His body
twitching.
Julie stares at the body. She's almost catatonic. She blinks. She
blinks again.
Suddenly, in DEATH CONVULSIONS, his arms fly toward her --
She SCREAMS --
CUT TO:
Everyone is gathered in the center of Julie's room. Julie is held
tight by Will. Brooks, the hotel manager, conducts the investigation.
Brooks approaches the closet door. Julie holds her breath. He throws
it open. A long beat.
BROOKS
I don't find this at all funny.
Julie steps in -- stares into the empty closet. She can't believe her
eyes.
She searches their faces, looking for someone to believe her.
JULIE
There was a body! I swear it!
WILL
(delicately)
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe
you were dreaming.
JULIE
(sharp)
I wasn't dreaming.
BROOKS
I knew you people were goining to be
trouble. I knew from the first time I
laid eyes on you.
Julie grabs Brooks by his robe.
JULIE
Listen to me. He's here.
BROOKS
Who? Who is here?
She doesn't know where to start. Nancy pokes her head around the door.
NANCY
What's going on?
TYRELL
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the
closet.
NANCY
Cool.
TYRELL
The rest of us see bathrobes.
JULIE
(sharp)
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right
there.
TYRELL
(not taking it seriously)
Fine. Show me the body.
Will wanders over to the closet and checks it out.
KARLA
Think about this, Julie. What did you
actually see?
JULIE
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck
from up there.
BROOKS
(case closed)
In the morning we'll talk to Derrick, the
"dockhand guy," and put the whole thing
to rest.
(looks to Nancy)
Now, let's slow down on the Dark and
Stormies and get some sleep.
NANCY
Don't look at me --
JULIE
I want off this island.
BROOKS
(tired)
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry
left hours ago. And we got a storm
coming. There won't be another one for
days.
TYRELL
There's a storm coming?
BROOKS
'Tis the season, like I told you. It's a
big one.
Julie goes for the phone.
JULIE
Then I'll call the mainland for a
charter.
BROOKS
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
She picks up the phone, listens, then dangles it from her hand.
JULIE
It's dead.
An exasperated Brooks heads for the door.
BROOKS
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna
be rough, but we'll make it.
KARLA
What about a radio?
BROOKS
Sorry. Emergencies only.
KARLA
What the hell would you call this?
BROOKS
I'd call this four spoiled city kids who
wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up
their butts.
(beat)
All we can do now is batten down and ride
it out. If things get really bad, there's
a storm shelter.
And Brooks is gone. Outside the window, it starts to rain. There's a
CLAP of thunder.
JULIE
looks out the window with glazed-over eyes.
It's a claustrophobic room. Estes turns away from the window,
shirtless in his uniform pants. A beaded cord hangs around his neck,
small fishhook dangling from it.
Beside the candle, he picks up a leather bag and dumps out a handful
of voodoo icons: roots, coins, sea glass, chicken's foot. He sets them
on a divination tray.
He opens vials and sprinkles powder and assorted liquids into a small
wooden bowl. He opens a drawer and extracts a toothbrush. He dips the
brush in the bowl -- covering its bristles with a sticky goo. He holds
the brush over the candle's flame. The old man watches it SIZZLE.
ESTES picks up
A STRAW FIGURE
and impales it on his fishhook necklace.
His eyes roll back in his head. He enters a trance.
DISSOLVE TO:
Olga, the maid, pushes her laundry cart toward the end of a long,
dimly lit hall. She sees a pile of dirty linens outside of a room --
ROOM 228.
She stops, perplexed. There's nobody staying in this room. She picks
them up and stuff them in her cart. Then she knocks on the door.
OLGA
Housekeeping.
(beat)
Housekeeping.
She knocks again and notices her hand leaving bloody marks on the
door. She looks at her other hand. Her arms and hands are covered in
blood.
She turns back to the linens. Something bloody is wrapped inside of
them. She paws at the sheets, trying to unravel the mystery --
The door the Room 228 slowly cracks open. A STEEL HOOK reaches out and
slices into her apron. It tugs. She turns, and she starts to SCREAM,
she is yanked into the room.
A DO NOT DISTURB sign flips over the handle and the door SLAMS shut.
We hear her SCREAMS from inside.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON AN ENGAGEMENT RING
Ray's engagement ring. The pawn shop owner, MAC, cowboy hat, knows his
job, holds it up to the viewing loop next to his eye.
MAC
Jeez, that's a full carat --
RAY
How much?
MAC
Well, there's some flaws in her...
RAY
How much?
Mac looks around his shop at the usual jumble of crap: vacuum
cleaners, golf clubs, guitar amps...
MAC
Don't really have the market for
something like this...
(like it hurts him)
I can go two...two-fifty.
RAY
Make it three hundred. And throw
that in, too.
REVEAL - .38 REVOLVER
encased in a glass cabinet.
MAC
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And
you got your waiting period.
RAY
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun
and keep the ring.
Mac barely hasitates, he knows he's getting a steal --
MAC
Fine, buddy.
THE GUN AND THE RING
go down on the counter next to each other. Mac pulls out some forms.
MAC (cont'd)
Fill these out. Leave the dates blank.
Ray starts writing. Mac is overcome by a moment of humanity.
MAC (cont'd)
Buddy, are you sure this is the way
you want to go?
Ray gives him a steely stare --
RAY
Is it loaded?
Mac shakes his head.
RAY (cont'd)
Load it.
Off Mac's sadness at young people today.
CUT TO:
We move into the hotel room and gradually reveal FOUR SETS OF FEET at
the end of one bed. They are crammed into a king-size bed together.
Julie is awake. She gets out of bed and moves toward the window.
It's raining outside. The wind is blowing. The storm has arrived.
Karla pulls a sleeping hand off her chest. The hand belongs to Will.
She pinches the hand. Will starts.
Tyrell kicks his feet around, trying to get some room.
TYRELL
This ain't the romantic weekend I
had in mind.
Karla kisses Tyrell on the cheek.
KARLA
(to Julie)
You get any sleep at all?
JULIE
Some.
Tyrell glares at Julie by the window. Sees the incredible rain.
TYRELL
Oh, look. Another day in paradise
with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss
Psychotic Episode.
KARLA
Hey --
TYRELL
(calling to Julie)
See any dead bodies out there? Any
fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
Julie ignores him, staring out the window.
WILL
Leave her alone.
Angry at her boyfriend, Karla gets out of bed and joins Julie.
TYRELL
I'm just saying what all of you are
thinking. It's bad enough gettin'
rained out without having to hold
her hand the whole time.
WILL
You don't have to be a jerk.
Karla pulls Julie close in a show of support for her friend whose mind
everyone believes has been inventing dead bodies.
JULIE
It's okay...He doesn't believe me.
That's his right. I'm starting to
think I'm crazy, too.
KARLA
Hey, slow down, turn off the little
motor up in there...What do you say
we go to the gym and work off a
little stress?
Julie doesn't look to enthusiastic.
CUT TO:
Karla and Julie enter the gym. It has Nautilus machines, treadmills,
Life-cycles, free weights, tanning beds, speed and heavy bags.
Karla walks over and does a full roundhouse -- spinning and planting
her foot dead center of the heavy bag.
JULIE
Nice move.
KARLA
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of
that and see how he likes it.
Julie smiles at her friend bravado. She steps over to a stairmaster
and starts her workout.
CUT TO:
Will and Tyrell step out of the room into the long, empty corridor.
They cross to a balcony overlooking the lobby. The whole place seems
deserted.
TYRELL
Where is everybody?
WILL
(gallows humor)
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.
(ghostly)
Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll,
joinnnn usss.
Will's voice echoes across the lobby. Tyrell is maybe a little
nervous, but hiding it.
TYRELL
Shut up.
They walk down the steps to the lobby.
They cross the lobby.
WILL
(calling out)
Hello?
(worried)
There's nobody here, Tyrell.
Tyrell's already out the front entrance.
Julie has finished on the stairmaster. Both she and Karla are sweaty
after a good workout. Their moods have improved.
KARLA
Come on, Vampira. I got just the
thing for you.
Karla leads Julie over to the tanning beds.
JULIE
Cancer in a box.
KARLA
No, this is the safe sun.
(joking)
It's better than a day at the beach.
Julie is reluctant.
KARLA (cont'd)
Come on, a little photosynthesis and
you'll feel like a new --
JULIE
Houseplant.
Karla opens the canopy of the tanning bed.
KARLA
Exactly.
Julie peels off her sweats. Lies down in her underwear. Straps on a
small pair of GOGGLES.
Karla lowers the canopy over Julie.
ANGLE ON A WALL TIMER
Karla sets the DIAL.
KARLA (cont'd)
Set to three seventy-five, bake for
one hour...
JULIE
Karla!
KARLA
Just kidding.
ULTRA-VIOLET TUBES
come to life -- Julie is bathed in purple light.
CUT TO:
Tyrell walks across the court to the sagging net.
There is a RUSTLING in the foliage around the court. SOMETHING moving
fast and quietly.
TYRELL
(calling out)
Hey, Bong Marley. Come here.
The door SLAMS shut behind him.
Tyrell looks back at the door. The latch seems to have stuck and it's
no longer swinging.
Tyrell turns back toward the other door and sees
The PIT BULL
standing in the doorway. Tyrell stares at the dog. The dog GROWLS at
Tyrell, low and menacing.
TYRELL
I'm gonna kill you, Bong Boy.
Simultaneously, Tyrell turns and the dog lunges forward.
Tyrell sprints to the door -- it's LOCKED by a length of metal slipped
into the coupling.
He turns to see the dog bounding at him --
Tyrell leaps up the fence just as the pit bull lunges for him. The dog
catches his pant leg. Tyrell kicks him away and frantically scrambles
up.
The dog relentlessly barks and snaps as Tyrell climbs the fence.
WILL
looks in at the dog angrily charging the chain-link. He looks up at
Tyrell.
WILL
Come on. Jump. I've got you.
He reaches out to try and catch Tyrell.
ON THE FENCE
Tyrell finally looses his grip and falls back, landing on top of Will.
He rolls quickly to his feet.
TYRELL
Thanks.
(furious)
I gotta find me a pool boy.
CUT TO:
Karla hammers the bag with a series of quick punches. She finally
stops to catch her breath and hears a THUMPING from the other room.
Karla sticks her head out the door to the gym, listening. At the end
of the hall
AN OPEN DOOR
is visible, a single BARE BULB lighting the room. Karla moves
curiously toward it.
Karla slowly sticks her head around the corner just as the THUMPING
NOISE SOUNDS LOUNDLY. She reacts --
A THUMPING DRYER
in a small laundry room. Karla relaxes.
KARLA
(doing Julie)
Gee, Karla...That'll break the
machine...
She approaches the MACHINE, which is rocking with the noise.
KARLA (cont'd)
Damn. How many pairs you got in
there?
She opens the dryer door and jumps back.
A BLOODY SHOE
flies out and into her arms. She looks down a beat, and SCREAMS bloody
murder.
A hot spray of blood gushes from the machine.
REVEAL - OLGA'S DISMEMBERED BODY
tumbling inside the dryer. Karla SCREAMS again. Then she hears the
SOUND of heavy boots coming down the hall. She runs to the door and
locks it.
She's trapped in a bloody basement cell. Suddenly somebody POUNDS on
the door. Karla SCREAMS.
She runs across the room, shoving a folding table toward a row of
BASEMENT WINDOWS.
The door is hit again and again. Somebody is throwing their shoulder
against it.
Karla bangs hysterically on the windows, leaving bloody handprints on
the panes.
CUT TO:
Julie's eyes suddenly open through the GOGGLES. She thumbs off her
WALKMAN.
JULIE
You say something?
Nothing. And just as Julie lies down again, Karla's frantic SCREAMS
echo down the hall.
Julie goes to push open the canopy. As she does, the CANOPY LID is
JAMMED DOWN ON TOP OF HER. A CHAIN shoots through the handles. Julie
is locked on the grill.
JULIE (cont'd)
Karla! Somebody? Hey, this isn't
funny.
Suddenly the lights go off. Julie thrashes around, trying to free
herself.
JULIE'S POV - THROUGH THE PURPLE LIGHT
She sees someone walking around in the room. The person steps closer.
Julie could almost reach out and touch him.
She begins to SCREAM!
They spill into the room. A light fog hangs in the air. The two of
them begin to COUGH and CHOKE.
Titus sits on the floor facing away from them, facing a window through
which gray light pierces the gloom.
Titus doesn't move. He's too still. In front of him is a large BONG
that still SMOKES SLIGHTLY.
TYRELL
Hey, pool boy.
Tyrell closes the distance and kicks Titus in the back.
Titus falls over like a block of wood, rictus already setting in.
His hands are bound behind him. The cord is tied off to some pipes
against the wall.
HIS FINGERNAILS SCRATHCED GROOVES
into the floor, scrabbling for the window and fresh air.
Will points out two empty one-gallon PLASTIC BOTTLES.
ANGLE ON THE BOTTLES
One is labeled CHLORINE, the other MURIATIC ACID.
Will pulls Tyrell from the pool house.
Karla ducks down on the table just as the window EXPLODES inward.
Tyrell kicks in the pane and looks in.
TYRELL (cont'd)
Give me your hand!
She reaches for him. He pulls her up and out through the window.
Tyrell and Will suddenly burst through the door.
ANGLE ON THE TANNING BED
Where Julie is just visible, her fingers madly groping for a way out.
JULIE
Oh, God, get me out. Get me out.
Will struggles to open the bed, but the chain holds strong.
Tyrell grabs a nearby dumbbell.
TYRELL
Hang on...
ANGLE ON THE CHAIN
Tyrell slams the barbell down, shattering the fiberglass handles.
A few of the ultraviolet tubes POP as Will yanks up on the cover.
They help Julie up, her eyes adjusting to non-purple light.
JULIE
(almost relieved)
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's
here...
(already moving
for the door)
We've got to get to the radio and
call for help.
KARLA
I think we can classify this as an
emergency situation.
They head for the manager's office.
CUT TO:
They burst into the middle of the room before seeing that Brooks's
head has a machete sticking out of it.
TYRELL
Yo, Brooks, listen up --
(reacting)
Whoa --
Tyrell, Will, and Karla look at the radio, which is smashed on the
floor next to Brooks.
Julie stares in shock at the reverse wall, at
A STUFFED MARLIN
with the words "I STILL KNOW" written on it in blood.
Karla SCREAMS --
TYRELL
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting
psycho.
KARLA
We gotta get out of here. Now.
THE POWER CUTS OUT and the hotel plunges into darkness.
Julie SCREAMS and runs from the hotel.
WILL
Julie!
Standard bus folks: old people in Panama hats, buzz-cut military geeks
on holiday.
Ray sits in a seat. He's in pain and does not look good.
He pops a handful of pills into his mouth and washes them down with an
Orange Crush --
A dignified OLD LADY has been watching him --
OLD LADY
People live healthy in Miami.
(sincere, but unsettling)
It's the future down there every day
of the week...The future.
Ray slumps back, waiting for the pills to work.
RAY
I'll keep that in mind.
CUT TO:
The door to Estes's room BANGS inward. Tyrell, Will, Karla, and Julie
charge into the room.
TYRELL
Yo, Freak Boy --
The cluttered room is empty.
WILL
He's not here.
Tyrell and Will begin roughly searching through Estes's possessions.
TYRELL
We're gonna find some weird crap
in here.
In the corner there is a curtain used as a partition. Julie pulls the
curtain back and discovers
A SMALL, HEAVY CABINET
sitting in the corner. It seems to glow from inside while casting an
evil pall over the room.
Julie moves toward it and hesitates before opening the doors.
Inside -- is a small voodoo shrine. A candle has burned low before it.
Hanging before the altar is
THE LITTLE STRAW MAN
impaled on a fishhook.
JULIE
Voodoo.
TYRELL
I told you.
Julie looks closer. She sees her toothbrush, a hair tie, assorted
other knickknacks belonging to her friends.
TYRELL
(to Karla)
Missing a hair tie?
Karla looks in. Tyrell snatches the straw man up.
TYRELL
We found our guy.
THUNDER rumbles across the sky like the judgement of God.
CUT TO:
Julie, Karla, Tyrell, and Will walk quickly down the corridor. They
have grabbed some of their things.
TYRELL
We gotta find flashlights, torches,
guns if they got 'em, anything
that'll help.
Will and Tyrell eye the stairs leading down to the lobby.
TYRELL
Wait. Maybe he's down there
collecting the body parts.
Will and Tyrell exchange a glance, an "are you man enough?" kind of
glance.
WILL
Let's go.
The men head into the kitchen and bar area.
WILL
We'll only be a second, okay?
TYRELL
Yeah, wait right here, it's the
safest place.
Karla is terrified and waits by the stairs, but something catches
Julie's eye. She walks across the lobby.
KARLA
Julie, where are you going?
Julie keeps walking. She sees historical pictures of the hotel: work
crews during construction; the first limbo contest; fishermen standing
next to sailfish and marlin.
Near the pictures, Julie sees the globe. It's spinning slowly.
Julie hesitates, then walks toward the globe. It stops spinning. She
looks down at it.
CLOSE ON - THE GLOBE
and Julie's hand finding Brazil. We see the capital is not Rio, but
Brazilia. This is dawning on Julie when we hear --
ESTES (v.o.)
Brasilia.
She jumps out of her skin. Estes was standing right there in the
shadows.
ESTES (cont'd)
That's the capital of Brazil, not
Rio.
Karla SCREAMS.
Tyrell comes flying across the lobby past Karla. He dives on Estes,
tackling him to the floor. Will is right behind him.
WILL/ESTES/TYRELL
Let go. I got him. That's me. It's
him. We got you...
JULIE
Leave him alone.
Tyrell holds up battered Estes --
TYRELL
Here's youre killer --
ESTES
No --
WILL
We found your voodoo crap --
ESTES
No --
They shake Estes, finally giving him a chance to speak.
ESTES (cont'd)
I found the bodies this morning...I
tried to use the radio, but he
already destroyed it.
JULIE
Let him go. I believe him.
KARLA
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
ESTES
I haven't hurt anyone...I stole
those things to help you. To
protect you.
JULIE
He's telling the truth. He could've
easily killed me. He didn't.
(beat while
this sinks in)
Look, we didn't even answer the
radio question right...This whole
thing was a setup.
KARLA
What do you mean?
JULIE
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It
was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
TYRELL
(starting to lose it)
You've got all these theories but
where is he? Where? Where's your
fisherman killer?
JULIE
I don't know.
TYRELL
(losing it)
You never do...The guy at the
nightclub, the body in your room last
night. Little notes that only mean
something to you. How do we even know
you're not the one behind this --
Estes steps forward --
JULIE
(to Tyrell)
How do we know you're not?
ESTES
(to Julie)
I know who you're talking about. He
used to work here at the hotel.
(beat)
And I've seen him around again. Out
in the woods by the orchard.
They look at Estes...Is he telling the truth?
ESTES
I can't remeber his name, but I
don't forget a face.
(beseeching)
I can show you...
They stare a beat --
WILL
How do we know you're not setting
us up?
ESTES
Where else you gonna go, son?
They look to the office, the gym...The sense of death surrounding
them.
KARLA
I know I don't want to stay in
here.
JULIE
We'll be better off in the open. If
we stick together, maybe we can kill
this creep for good.
TYRELL
Show us.
They begin moving for the door.
CUT TO:
A gear-strewn office. Paulsen watches an episode of Party of Five.
There is a loud KNOCKING at the door.
PAULSEN
What the...
Paulsen slowly gets up. He cracks the door open. Ray stands
silhouetted against the rain.
RAY
I need to get to Tower Bay Island.
Paulsen senses something isn't right.
PAULSEN
We're closed.
Ray pushes his way in --
RAY
I need to get there, now.
Paulsen looks at him standing there drenched.
PAULSEN
Did you happen to notice what's
going on outside?
Ray pulls out the gun and points it at Paulsen --
RAY
I'm not looking for a weather
report, I'm looking for a boat. So
which one's yours?
CUT TO:
They move cautiously into the kitchen. Blue emergency lights flicker
above them. It's a big room with plenty of nooks and crannies for
somebody to be hiding in.
Tyrell picks up a couple of different knives. He hefts them in his
hand.
TYRELL
What I need is a gun. Not a steak
knife.
Karla grabs a paring knife --
TYRELL (cont'd)
You gonna clean vegetables? You
gonna stir-fry? You need something
that'll get his attention.
He picks up a huge butcher's knife and cuts the air with it. He then
roughly empties other drawers looking for more weapons.
Karla looks to Julie, something on her mind. Julie catches the look.
KARLA
(hurt)
I'm your best friend...You could
have told me the truth about what
happened. I would've understood.
JULIE
(sad)
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing
to be over. I didn't want to involve
anybody else.
KARLA
It's too late for that.
Julie steps over to Karla.
JULIE
I'm so sorry. I brought this on
everyone. It's my fault.
Tyrell picks up on the mood swing. He moves closer to them. He's
sympathetic.
TYRELL
Forget that. You didn't do nothing.
This fisherman's a piece of scum.
(hard for him to admit)
I should've been listening to you...
I'm sorry.
Julie smiles for a second.
TYRELL (cont'd)
Now, let's take a look at the
pantry.
KARLA
You think that's a good place to
hide?
TYRELL
I don't know, but I'm starving.
CUT TO:
Tyrell, Julie, and Karla approach the pantry -- a huge steel door.
Tyrell steps inside.
TYRELL
Steel door...Food...Perfect.
He starts looking for something to eat --
CLANK. There's a soft CLATTERING from somewhere in the room. Everyone
freezes, staring into the darkness.
Tyrell puts a finger to his lips, then creeps down an aisle,
listening. There's nothing but SILENCE.
He moves toward the first aisle...He jumps out. The aisle is empty.
JULIE AND KARLA
move down an aisle behind him.
Tyrell ducks around to the second aisle. He slices the air, ready to
pounce. This aisle is empty.
JULIE AND KARLA
nervously move another aisle down.
Tyrell moves stealthily toward the third aisle...This is it. He lunges
forward into the row...Empty, also.
There's a small SOUND...A MOUSE scampers off under the shelves. Tyrell
turns and smiles at Karla and Julie --
TYRELL
It's just a --
A ROLLING PIN
bashes him on the back of the head. Tyrell hits the floor,
unconscious.
JULIE AND KARLA SCREAM
KARLA
Ty!
A DARK FIGURE jumps down from the shelves. Tyrell puts his arms up --
TYRELL
(yelling for mercy)
Don't kill me --
JULIE
Wait, it's Nancy --
Nancy, the bartender steps out of the shadows brandishing her rolling
pin.
CUT TO:
Tyrell stands at the sink, where Karla holds a towel full of ice to
his head. Nancy, the bartender, looks on apologetically.
NANCY
I'm sorry, but you could've been
the one doing all of this --
TYRELL
And so could you -- crazy fool.
NANCY
You stumbled into my hiding place.
TYRELL
Must have missed the sign.
NANCY
Excuse me, but this island didn't
have a murder rate until you people
showed up.
(chilled)
I've never seen a dead body before.
JULIE
Get used to it.
NANCY
Who's doing this?
TYRELL
(friendly)
Don't even get her started...It's a
long, long story and you probably
wouldn't believe a word of it.
Tyrell moves as he talks, fed up and exhasted. He crosses past the
stove and under a huge hanging rack of pots and pans.
TYRELL (cont'd)
I mean, all I know for sure is this
is the worst vacation of my life...
I'm tired, and I'm hungry, and I
personally haven't seen one damn
psycho killer...
THWACK! A STEEL HOOK
sinks deep into the base of Tyrell's shaved skull, a look of abject
surprise on his face.
The women freeze as Tyrell dances like a marionette before being
hoisted up and hung on the rack like a used saucepan.
THE FISHERMAN
is in the vent above the stove. He stares out at them from the hood of
his slicker.
Ben jumps from the range onto the floor. Karla is in shock. Julie
yanks her and they flee.
As she goes, Julie picks up
A LOOSE KNIFE
and hides it in her back pocket.
CUT TO:
Julie, Karla, and Nancy run into the lobby. The storm is WAILING
outside the front doors.
They pause for a second. Behind them we hear the rapid THUD-THUD-THUD
of Ben's boots.
Nancy goes straight to a desk and pulls out a flashlight. She points
to the main staircase.
NANCY
I know where we can hide.
The women run up the stairs. Behind them, we hear Ben's FOOTFALLS
echoing.
On the top floor, they race toward the end of a dark hallway.
At the far end of the hall, Nancy illuminates a section of the
ceiling.
NANCY
Give me a boost up --
Julie helps Nancy reach a pull cord in the ceiling.
A WOODEN LADDER
pulls down. Nancy quickly climbs up.
BEN WILLIS
enters the hallway and continues toward them.
ON THE LADDER
Karla slips, nearly knocking Julie to the floor. They both scramble
upwards --
Ben hits the ladder --
Just as Julie reaches the top rung she SCREAMS --
BEN'S HOOK IS ON HER FOOT!
Nancy appears in the opening and throws a brick down at Ben. It hits
him in the chest and knocks him back.
Julie makes it into the attic. They pull the ladder up behind them
like a drawbridge.
Julie, Karla, and Nancy surround the hatch they've just shut. They
fumble with it --
JULIE
There's no way to lock it.
KARLA
What do we do?
From below comes LAUGHTER. There's a tug on the hatch, cracking it
open. The girls pull it back shut, but it's hard to get a grip.
There's more tugging, the hatch bending down; they can see Ben. Then,
the rope SNAPS. The hatch slams shut.
NANCY
There's no way to grip this thing.
Suddenly the STEEL TIP of the HOOK pokes through the crack...It
wriggles around...Turning...And begins to pull the hatch down.
They try to hold it...But it's no use. They let go and jump away.
The attic is lit by a cathedral window. It's crosshatched with wooden
beams and pink insulation.
NANCY
Watch your step...
THUNK! Karla's foot goes through a gap between two beams.
SMASH CUT TO:
KARLA'S FOOT
dangles through the ceiling.
SMASH BACK TO:
Julie helps Karla back up onto a beam.
NANCY (cont'd)
Stay on the beams!
Karla and Julie follow her precarious progress.
Ben climbs off the ladder to a beam. He watches them leap from beam to
beam. His hook glints in the light.
Julie, Karla, and Nancy move toward the cathedral window. They turn.
They are cut off. They spread out against the wall looking for an
opening to get back to the hatch.
Ben feints toward Nancy then swipes at Julie --
He misses. She leaps away. She looks down. Instead of insulation, she
sees a
WINDOW INTO THE HONEYMOON SUITE
She sees her bed through a one-way mirror. Julie stares, momentarily
transfixed. Karla is edging her way around the side of Ben.
BEN
(re: the mirror)
You'd be amazed by what you'd see.
My wife with every man on the
island, for example.
(to Julie)
And you, sexy...I loved watching you.
JULIE
You sick freak.
Ben suddenly whirls and lunges at Karla. He grabs her, but they both
lose their balance, teetering for a moment on one of the beams, before
falling --
They CRASH through the mirror --
Karla and Ben hit the bed in a rain of glass.
Karla bounces to her feet and dives out of the way as Ben swings his
hook.
The roof shatters in an explosion of flying glass.
Karla land on her back.
She's unconsious --
CUT TO:
Julie and Nancy look at the empty space which once was a roof
supporting Karla --
JULIE
(screaming)
Karla!
Ben turns and looks up at Nancy and Julie. Then, he sprints from the
balcony.
Julie and Nancy duck back into the attic.
CUT TO:
Julie and Nancy climb down into the hallway. They are cautious,
expecting Ben at every turn.
They hurry across the lobby.
CUT TO:
A sprawling, steam-filled room, dense with vegetation of all sorts and
shelf after shelf of beautiful orchids.
Karla lies unconscious. Slowly, she opens her eyes.
There's a rustling in the flowers. She tries to get up, but can't yet.
She waits in terror as
BIRDS
fly up and out of the hole she's made in the roof.
Karla tries to stand and her leg gives way. She tests her knee --
KARLA
Oww...
Karla starts hobbling. She reaches the door -- it's locked from the
other side.
There is a thick glass window set in the middle of the door.
The cranes startle again, something upsetting them. Karla spins to
look. Nothing.
CUT TO:
Julie and Nancy arrive at the door. Karla pounds on the other side --
points to the lock.
KARLA
It's locked!
Nancy sees a KEY RING by the door.
NANCY
It's gotta be one of these.
Nancy tries the first of many keys. Something catches Julie's eye. She
moves in for a closer look. Her eyes go wide --
ORCHID HOUSE - JULIE'S POV
A powerful BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks. Fills the room with a pulse of
bright light. BEN IS STANDING INSIDE AND HE'S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR
KARLA.
JULIE
(terrified)
He's inside.
Karla spins. Sees him. Her terrified scream blends with the cranes,
now SHRIEKING VIOLENTLY.
KARLA
Please! Hurry!
Nancy fumbles with the keys. Drops them. Julie tries to keep calm.
JULIE
Come on...
Ben closes fast, slicing the tops off orchids as he goes. He skewers a
bud on the tip of his hook.
Karla pounds on the door.
KARLA
(frantic)
Hurry!
Nancy fumbles for the right key but the lock is old.
JULIE
Nancy...
NANCY
(crying)
It's jammed!
The key is stuck.
KARLA
(through glass)
Come on!!
She's running out of time. Julie sees a FIRE AXE encased in the glass
safety box.
JULIE
(determined)
No way!!
Julie smashes the glass with her elbow. Grabs the axe.
JULIE
(to Nancy)
Move!
Julie hammers the door with the axe. Wood splinters. Glass cracks.
Ben is almost on top of Karla now.
Julie swings. The axe breaks the glass, pulls the frame out. Julie
drops the axe. They grab Karla. Pull her through.
Ben swings. The hook rips Karla's shoe, but Julie and Nancy pull her
through.
Julie and Ben are face to face. Julie has the axe in her hands. She
stares him down.
JULIE
Come on, gimme a shot --
Ben rips off his hook, eyeing Julie.
KARLA
(shouting)
Julie, come on.
They flee. Ben tries the door, realizes it had locked behind him. He
can't fit through the circular window. He throws his shoulder against
the door. And again. And again.
The door frame starts to give --
CUT TO:
Stairs lead down into darkness. Karla hesitates --
KARLA
I don't know...
JULIE
Come on, you can make it.
Julie gets in, pulling Karla in behind her. They pull the door closed
behind them.
NANCY
There's a light somewhere.
The darkness is complete. We hear MOVEMENT.
KARLA
Julie?
JULIE
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
NANCY
This place has emergency power.
Just ease you way down the stairs
and I'll find the light.
JULIE
Okay. I'm at the bottom. Karla,
just get my hand.
KARLA
I'm holding your hand!
JULIE
No, you're not.
KARLA
...Nancy?
Nancy pulls the chain on an overhead bulb. The lights go on,
illuminating
THE DEAD CORPSES
of Brooks, Derrick, Olga, and Titus -- whose hand Karla is holding.
The women SCREAM!
They muddle together, trying to collect themselves.
Suddenly, there is a POUNDING on the iron door. They SCREAM.
Then, Julie remembers the axe. She motions the others to stay back --
JULIE
All right --
The iron hatch is slowly opening. Julie gets the axe into possition --
WILL
pokes his head through. He's clutching a piece of wood as a weapon.
WILL
It's you guys, thank god. Is
everyone okay?
They are ecstatic to see him. They bound up the concrete stairs --
KARLA
Help's here. Help's here.
Will slumps down on the bar floor. He's floating in and out of
consciousness. Julie leans over him, concerned.
JULIE
Oh, my god, you're bleeding to
death.
She looks back towards Nancy --
JULIE (cont'd)
We need a first-aid kit.
NANCY
(already moving)
I saw one in the lobby.
Karla starts, then hesitates. Will moans, looks at her.
NANCY (cont'd)
I'll come with you.
WILL
You'll be okay. It's over.
Karla and Nancy rush from the bar. Julie looks tenderly at Will. He
looks back at her. She pulls some hair off his forehead. He smiles
weakly.
JULIE
Will, just hold on. We'll get you
fixed up.
CUT TO:
Karla and Nancy go to the area near the check-in and behind the desk.
NANCY
Look up there. I'll look over here.
Karla looks behind the desk. Nancy is searching the shelves.
CUT TO:
Julie tenderly searches the area around Will's stomach. She's fussing
with the clothes, looking for the wound.
JULIE
You've got blood everywhere, but I
can't find the wound.
Will takes her head in his hands, looks her in the eye.
WILL
That's because it's not my blood.
The slow change in Julie as she realizes...
She starts to run. Will roughly grabs her.
WILL (cont'd)
It's time you woke up, Julie.
His voice switches to that of a familiar radio disk jockey.
WILL (cont'd)
(as Mark in the Morning)
AND START CONTEMPLATING THE ULTIMATE
MAGIC GETAWAY!
He drags her out of the bar.
CUT TO:
Nancy sees a white metal box sitting on a shelf. She reaches for it...
It's a first aid kit.
ANOTHER HAND
reaches over and lands on top of her hand. She jumps and sees Estes
right behind her. Karla SCREAMS.
ESTES
Will...He's in on it. He's --
Suddenly Estes's expression changes to surprise, and
A SPEAR TIP
appears in the front of his chest.
Nancy screams and looks over Estes's shoulder to see
BEN WILLIS
standing there holding a spear gun.
Estes topples over on top of Nancy, pinning her underneath his dying,
convulsing body. Nancy struggles to get loose.
NANCY
Help me.
Karla rushes to Nancy. She tugs on her arm, trying to pull her free.
The fisherman strides toward them. He raises his hook. He swings at
Karla's head.
THE HOOK CATCHES
on a beam. Karla struggle with Nancy.
KARLA
Come on, come on.
Ben tries to free his hook hand. Karla looks up at him. He calmly puts
his foot onto Estes's back and steps down with all of his weight,
driving
THE SPEAR TIP
deep into Nancy who expires with a sigh.
KARLA (cont'd)
Damn you.
Karla, blind with rage, attacks the fisherman. He kicks out with a
boot and sends Karla fying onto
A GLASS TABLE
in the lobby area. The table explodes. Karla is finished.
The fisherman works his hook free from the post. Karla is unmoving and
looks quite dead.
CUT TO:
Julie lets herself into the house. She leans her bike against another
bike in the hallway.
It's a perfect day. Birds CHIRPING. WIND in the willows. There's
another NOISE...from inside her house.
She goes perfectly still. And listens. Behind her, by the kitchen, the
shadow of a FIGURE moves. She whirls.
NOTHING
She creeps down the hallway toward her kitchen. She pauses --
The dark figure almost knocks into her. She SCREAMS.
It's Ray. He's holding a disemboweled toaster.
JULIE
Ray...what are you doing?
RAY
(toaster)
Oh...it's not working right.
You're home early.
(sees she's shaken)
Did I scare you?
JULIE
Never do that again.
RAY
(tender)
Hey -- I didn't know you were here.
It's okay.
(beat)
We got the refrigerator in. Come
see.
She sees the love in his eyes. She hugs him.
JULIE
I love it here.
RAY
It's gonna be great.
DISSOLVE TO:
Julie climbs to the top of the stairs. She passes Ray in the bathroom.
She pauses in the doorway --
Ray is at the sink in boxer shorts. He's using an electric Waterpic
devicice that has just been opened, a gift from the party. It makes a
low WHIRRING sound.
RAY
(seeing her)
Checking the locks again?
JULIE
You know me to well.
Julie smile and walks to the bedroom.
CUT TO:
Julie climbs into bed with a book. The bedroom is clean and orderly.
The windows are closed. The closet door is shut.
The room is decorated simply: a high antique bed; unopened boxes; a
highboy; an antique mirror leaning against the wall. A stuffed bear
sits in a chair.
There is a CLATTER from another room. Julie freezes. She waits. She
hears it again. She climbs out of bed.
CUT TO:
Julie walks into the dark spare bedroom. The CLATTERING SOUND comes
from the open window. The wind is blowing the blinds.
Julie relaxes. She shuts the window. As she leaves the room, we notice
the dirty imprint of a boot below the window.
Julie passes Ray who is still absorbed with the new toy.
Behind him, the door softly closes. The lock twists. Ray is oblivious,
happy being the dental-hygene pacesetter of the household.
Julie enters the room. She looks at the closet door. It is open a
crack. She hesitates, trying to remember if it was open before -- it
wasn't.
Julie approaches the closet. She catches her refelction in the mirror
next to the closet. She peers into the crack of the closet. She can't
see anything. She throws open the closet door.
NOTHING
She looks around the room.
JULIE
What is my problem?
She sits down on the bed.
We see her bare feet from under the bed.
She smiles, relaxes. She looks in the mirror leaning against the wall.
Something has caught her eye. She freezes. She turns slowly back to
the reflection in the mirror. She sees the glint of steel --
A HOOK -- CRASH ZOOM INTO REFLECTION --
THE FISHERMAN CROUCHING UNDER HER BED
Julie turns too late --
The fisherman lunges out and grabs her legs. Julie screams. She goes
down --
Her nails scrape into the wooden floor as she is dragged under the
bed.
