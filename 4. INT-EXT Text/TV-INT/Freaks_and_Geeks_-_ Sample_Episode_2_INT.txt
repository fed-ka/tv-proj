      A TIGHT CLOSE UP of Sam's face. It is a face of panic, of 
      fear, of confusion. His eyes dart from one side to the 
      other.

                                  SAM
                          (to himself)
                    Oh, man ... what was I thinking?

      We PULL BACK to see that Sam has his back up against the 
      door of the boys' bathroom. He's also wearing nothing but a 
      pair of white underwear.

      Okay, just act natural and no one will notice.

      He takes a deep breath, moves away from the door, grabs the 
      handle, hesitates a second, finds his resolve and opens the 
      door.


      The halls are crowded with students. Sam's head peeks out 
      from the bathroom. He looks up and down the hall, sees the 
      students and takes another deep breath. Steels himself and 
      steps out into the hallway, wearing only his underwear.

      He walks tentatively at first, ready for humiliation. A few 
      people give him a quick glance but no one seems to notice.

      Sam seems to get a little more confidence and walks a 
      little more casual. People are TALKING to each other, 
      involved in their own worlds. Sam's face relaxes as he 
      walks on.

      He sees Cindy Sanders come around the corner and head 
      toward him. She's walking with a girlfriend and is deep in 
      conversation. Sam looks nervous but keeps walking toward 
      her, trying to act casual.

      Just as he's about to pass her, she looks over at him.

                                  CINDY
                    Oh, my God.
                            (looks him up and down)
                    Sam, where's your clothes?      Suddenly, everybody stops what they're doing and looks at 
      him. They look shocked. Some GASP.

                                  SAM
                    I ... uh ... I forgot to put them on 
                    today.

      Cindy stares ... and then starts LAUGHING. The other 
      students all start LAUGHING too. Sam's face fills with 
      terror and he takes off running. As he runs, everybody he 
      passes points and LAUGHS. Sam's dying of embarrassment. The 
      school bell RINGS.

      SMASH CUT TO:


        RIIIINNNNNGGGG!!! Sam's alarm is going off. Sam bolts up in 
      bed.

                                  SAM
                      Noooooooooo!!!

      He wakes up and looks over at the clock. It reads 7:00 am.

                                  JEAN (O.C.)
                            (from kitchen)
                    Sam, get up. You're gonna miss your 
                    bus.

      Sam stares at the clock, then falls back, his head hitting 
      the pillow and disappearing into it. He MOANS.

                                  SAM
                    Oh, man, I hate high school.

                                                                              CUT TO:


                              OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE                                        ACT ONE



      Sam is drinking a glass of orange juice and eating a bowl 
      of count chocula, reading the box as he eats. His mom, 
      jean, is making herself a cup of tea. Harold comes in, 
      tying his tie.

                                  HAROLD
                    Sam, are you going to come work at the 
                    store today?

                                  SAM
                    No, I'm going over Neal's. He bought 
                    an Estes rocket.

                                  HAROLD
                    Sam, you should be working instead of 
                    fooling around after school.

                                  SAM
                    But I worked yesterday.

                                  HAROLD
                    Well, guess what, Sam? The store's 
                    still in business. I could use you 
                    today.

                                  JEAN
                    Honey, he's fourteen. Let him have 
                    some fun.

                                  HAROLD
                    Working at the store's not fun? That's 
                    news to me.

      Lindsay comes into the kitchen wearing her old jeans and 
      army field jacket. She heads right for the door.

                                  JEAN
                    Oh, Lindsay, you're not wearing that 
                    horrible jacket again today, are you?                                    LINDSAY
                    Gee, mom, kinda looks like it.

                                  JEAN
                    Don't other kids dress nice?

                                    LINDSAY
                    Mom, nobody cares how I dress.

                                  JEAN
                    I care.

                                  HAROLD
                    Lindsay, I want you to work at the 
                    store after school.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Dad!

                                  HAROLD
                    Look, someone in this family has to 
                    work at the store today. It's a family 
                    owned business. "Family." Get it?

                                    LINDSAY
                    I can't.

                                  HAROLD
                    Why not?

                                  JEAN
                    You've got Math-lete practice, don't 
                    you?

      Lindsay pauses. She doesn't but the set-up's too good.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Yes.

      And she's gone. Jean gives Harold a look.

                                  JEAN
                    Which one's Daniel again?

                                  HAROLD
                    Isn't he the captain of the Math-
                    letes?      BRUM BRUM! The house practically shakes from the bassy 
      sound of a muscle car engine. Jean looks out the window.

      ANGLE ON: A yellow Trans Am pulls into the driveway. It's a 
      rust bucket, painted bright yellow with the Trans Am eagle 
      decal covering the entire hood. Lindsay jumps in.

                                  JEAN (O.C.)
                    I don't think he's a Math-lete.

      The car RUMBLES back out to the street. Then it PEELS OUT 
      LOUDLY, leaving a cloud of smoke.

      ANGLE ON: Jean frowns and turns back to Harold.

                                  JEAN
                    That's the boy she skipped class with.

                                  HAROLD
                    I thought that was a Nick.

                                  JEAN
                    Well, then Daniel seems like a friend 
                    of Nick's. Either way, I don't like 
                    it. Sam, do you know anything about 
                    these boys?

                                  SAM
                    No.

                                  HAROLD
                    You're not lying, are you, Sam?

                                  SAM
                    No.

                                  HAROLD
                    'Cause you know what happens to liars 
                    in this world, don't you?

                                  SAM
                    "They end up getting killed in jail."

                                  HAROLD
                    Right.

      Harold takes Sam's glass of orange juice. Sam makes a 
      panicked grab for it but it's too late. Harold takes a       drink.

                                  SAM
                    Dad!

                                  HAROLD
                    What?
                            (looking at glass)
                    You can get another glass.

                                  JEAN
                    That's all the juice there was left.

                                  HAROLD
                    Oh. Well, then drink the rest.

      Sam looks rather horrified as Harold sets the half finished 
      glass back down in front of Sam. Sam stares at the lip 
      print that shows where Harold's mouth was. We can see this 
      really bothers Sam.

                                  SAM
                    No. You can have it.

      Sam grabs his books and leaves out the door, visibly upset. 
      Harold and Jean watch him go.

                                  HAROLD
                    What's his problem?

                                  JEAN
                    Oh, you know. Him and germs.

                                  HAROLD
                    But I'm his father.

                                  JEAN
                    Let it go, Harold.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      MRS. BRONNER, a salt and pepper haired woman in her 50's, 
      is behind the wheel. She's heavy set with a tight beehive 
      and wears an United Auto Workers wind breaker.

                                  MRS. BRONNER (pleasant)
                    Good morning, students. Find a seat.

      ANGLE ON: Sam, Neal and Bill as they sit. They look 
      surprised.

                                  NEAL
                    Mrs. Bronner's back.

                                  SAM
                    I thought she quit.

                                  NEAL
                    She did.

                                  BILL
                    She quits every year. I heard that her 
                    husband's a spy and so she has to quit 
                    to go to different countries with him.

                                  NEAL (stares a beat)
                    Mr. Bronner's our garbage man.

      BILL Maybe that's just what he wants us to think. Maybe 
      he's undercover.

                                  NEAL
                    Bill, she quits because Kim Kelly and 
                    her friends always make her cry.

                                  BILL
                    Maybe the CIA pays Kim to do that so 
                    nobody'll know why Mrs. Bronner's 
                    really leaving.

                                  NEAL
                    You gotta stop watching so much TV.      ANGLE ON: Lindsay sits toward the middle of the bus. Millie 
      plops down next to her. Lindsay looks like she'd rather not 
      sit next to Millie. Millie just gives her a happy smile.

      ANGLE ON: Mrs. Bronner peers out the windshield up the 
      street. She sees groups of kids on every approaching 
      corner. She squints and sees something. Her face suddenly 
      looks both worried and determined.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      The bus is almost full. Sue and Karen are walking to the 
      back of the bus as Kim gets on. Mrs. Bronner steels 
      herself.

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                    Good morning, Miss Kelly.

                                  KIM
                    It was until I saw your face.

      Karen and Sue LAUGH. Mrs. Bronner forces a tolerant smile 
      as the girls file past her and head to the back of the bus.

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                    Glad to see you're still a comedian.

                                  KIM
                    Glad to see you're still fat.

      Karen and Sue SCREAM WITH EVIL LAUGHTER. Mrs. Bronner looks 
      angry but suppresses it. Lindsay looks out the window. We 
      can tell she really dislikes Kim. Sam exchanges a look with 
      Neal. Neal nods to indicate "here we go again" as the bus 
      GRINDS into gear.

                                  KAREN
                    If you can't find it, grind it!      The whole back of the bus LAUGHS as the bus pulls away. 
      GARY FORMAN, a short fat kid, turns around and looks at Sam 
      and Neal.

                                  GARY (quietly)
                    Hey, look what I brought.

      Gary holds up a bottle of Squirt. It's open but hasn't been 
      drunk out of yet.

                                  SAM
                    Ooo, I love Squirt. Let me have some.

                                  NEAL
                    Gimme some first.

      Neal grabs the bottle and goes to take a drink. Sam looks 
      horrified.

                                  SAM
                    No!

      But it's too late. Neal has his mouth on the bottle and is 
      taking a drink. He finishes, his lips wet with pop.

                                  NEAL
                    Aaah ... Delicious! Here.

      He hands the bottle to Sam. Sam just looks at the top of 
      the bottle, still wet with Neal's spit.

                                  SAM
                            (handing bottle back to 
                            gary)
                    Naa, I'm not thirsty.

                                  NEAL
                    You just said you wanted some. What's 
                    the matter? I don't have cooties.

      A cloud of cigarette smoke wafts past them. Mrs. Bronner 
      sniffs the air, then looks into the long mirror over her 
      head into the back of the bus.

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                    Put out the cigarettes, please.

      Kim and the tough girls just LAUGH derisively. Mrs. Bronner       takes a deep breath and steels herself.

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                    Ladies, I'm not joking. Put out those 
                      cigarettes.

                                  KIM
                    Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were 
                    joking.

      Kim takes a long drag and blows a defiant jet of smoke over 
      the heads of the other students toward Mrs. Bronner's 
      mirror.

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                            (trying to sound calm)
                    Don't make me pull this bus over.

                                  KIM
                    We're not making you do anything, 
                    lady, so why don't you just drive us 
                    to school?

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                    I will as soon as you put those 
                      cigarettes out.

      CLICK! Karen switches her large radio on. The song "BLACK 
      BETTY" blares out, distorting the speakers.

                                  SONG
                    Oh, Black Betty, bam a lam ...

      Mrs. Bronner SIGHS, upset, looks up in the mirror and locks 
      eyes with Kim. Kim stares back, challenging. Mrs. Bronner 
      takes a deep breath and pulls the bus over to the shoulder.

                                  NEAL
                    Oh, man, I hope I'm not gonna be late 
                    for chemistry. I've got a paper due.

      The air brakes HISS as the bus stops. Sam looks back at 
      Kim, studying her. Kim's face is intense, her eyes showing 
      deep anger. The combination of being pretty and mean makes 
      her all the more scary. After a beat, Kim sees Sam staring.

                                  KIM
                    What are you lookin' at, geek?      Sam quickly turns back around. Mrs. Bronner stands up and 
      turns to face Kim.

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                            (yelling over music)
                    Turn off that radio.

                                  KIM
                    What?

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                    Turn off that radio!

                                  KIM
                    What?

      Kim turns the radio up LOUDER. She and the girls all start 
      CLAPPING and dancing in their seats.

                                  KIM, KAREN & SUE
                    "Black Betty, bam a lam/She really 
                    makes me high, bam a lam!"

      Kim prods another freak girl sitting in the back.

                                  KIM
                    C'mon, Lori, get into it!

      They all start dancing and clapping more. Mrs. Bronner is 
      starting to turn red.

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                    I told you girls to turn that radio 
                    OFF!

                                  KIM
                    What? I can't hear you. The radio's 
                    too loud.

      A lot of the bus LAUGHS at that, except for Sam who looks 
      at Mrs. Bronner sadly. He sees her face fill with anger.

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                            (ear splitting scream)
                    EVERYONE, BE QUIET!!!

      Everyone stops laughing, surprised. Mrs. Bronner gives the 
      students an angry once-over, then glares right at Kim. The       radio continues to play, only lower.

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                            (controlled rage)
                    I want you girls to turn that radio 
                    off and put out those cigarettes. Now.

      Silence. A staring match between Kim Kelly and Mrs. Bronner 
      takes place. Both intense.

                                  MRS. BRONNER
                    Did you hear what I said, Miss Kelly?

      Sam watches the scene, unsure. The whole bus seems to be 
      holding its breath. Kim's eyes narrow. There's a rage in 
      her eyes that we've seldom seen on a teenage face. Then ... 

                                  KIM
                            (slowly; hissing)
                    You don't tell me what to do, old 
                    lady. Nobody tells me what to do. So, 
                    just shut your fat, ugly face and 
                    drive the bus, you old whore.

      Mrs. Bronner's eyes show shock. Kim's stare is venomous, 
      hateful. Mrs. Bronner's stunned. She knows she lost the 
      war. Kim just continues to stare daggers at her.

      After a beat, Mrs. Bronner very slowly turns around and 
      makes her way back to the driver's seat. As she passes Sam, 
      Sam looks at her face. She looks damaged. Sam starts to 
      look back at Kim, then thinks better of it.

      Mrs. Bronner sits down and puts the bus into gear. We can 
      only see her back but she looks broken. The bus moves 
      slowly forward. The radio TURNS UP AGAIN. Kim and the girls 
      start SINGING and LAUGHING again. They light up new 
      cigarettes.

                                  NEAL
                          (to sam)
                    Man, I can't wait until I can drive 
                    myself to school.


      The halls are empty. RING! The school bell goes off and the       halls immediately flood with students from their first 
      period classes. Lindsay and Daniel enter through the front 
      doors.

                                  DANIEL
                    Hey, if we skip last period, we can 
                    meet up at Nick's house. He's got the 
                    new Zepplin album.

                                    LINDSAY
                    I'm there.

      MR. ROSSO, the school's guidance counselor, comes out of 
      his office. Sees Lindsay.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Lindsay, I need to talk to you.

      He walks up to Lindsay and Daniel. Lindsay gives him an 
      anti authority "yeah?" look.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Daniel, do you mind if I talk to 
                    Lindsay alone?

                                    LINDSAY
                    Just tell me. He doesn't have to 
                    leave.

                                  DANIEL
                    Naa, it's cool, Linds. I'm gonna hit 
                    the smoking patio. I'll see you at 
                    lunch.

      Daniel takes off. Lindsay gives Mr. Rosso the look again. 
      He tries to ignore her attitude.

                                  MR. ROSSO 
                            (enthusiastic)
                    Lindsay, I talked to the panel and 
                    they've let me extend the deadline for 
                    you to apply to the Academic 
                      Decathlon.

                                    LINDSAY
                    I'm not doing it this year.                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Lindsay, I know you don't want to but 
                    I really think you should. We need 
                    you. And I hate to see you cut 
                    yourself off like this.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Mr. Rosso, I'm not doing it.

                                  MS. DELUCA (O.C.)
                    Lindsay?

      MS. DELUCA, the math teacher, walks up. She's a slight 
      woman with a kind face.

                                  MS. DELUCA
                    How come you weren't in class this 
                    morning?

                                    LINDSAY
                    We had car trouble.
                          (to Mr. Rosso)
                    Is there anything else you needed to 
                    ask me?

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    No, that's all.

      Lindsay turns and heads off. Mr. Rosso and Ms. Deluca watch 
      her go, confused. Mr. Rosso shakes his head.

                                  MS. DELUCA
                    What's happened to her?

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    I don't know. But this isn't going to 
                    happen while I'm here. Not on my 
                    shift.


      Sam is at his locker. He hears girls' LAUGHTER. Turns and 
      sees Kim Kelly and her entourage coming down the hall 
      toward him. Sam stares at her.

      FROM HIS P.O.V.

      Kim Kelly seems to be walking in slow motion. She's still       wearing her long black leather coat. Her black hair and 
      dark eye makeup make her look tough, mysterious. She also 
      looks quite pretty. She jokes with Karen and Sue and yells 
      out to different people. SAM stares at her, studies her. We 
      can see he's strangely enamored. Kim is about to pass Sam 
      when she sees him staring. She, Karen and Sue stop in front 
      of him.

                                  KIM
                    Hey, geek, you got a problem?

                                  SAM
                    Uh ... no. I was just looking for a 
                    friend of mine.

                                  KIM
                    Are you telling me I look like a 
                    friend of yours?

                                  KAREN
                    Hey, Kim, I think he likes you.

      Karen and Sue LAUGH. Kim looks at them, then back at Sam. 
      Moves her face close to his.

                                  KIM
                    Is that true? Do you like me? Do you 
                    love me?

      Even though she's mocking him, there's something hard to 
      read in her face. Could she be serious? The fact that she's 
      so close has Sam dizzy and off-guard.

                                  SAM
                    I ... uh ... I mean, I like you like a 
                    friend.

                                  KIM
                            (moving closer; softly)
                    I don't think so. I think you like me 
                    like me. I think you want to kiss me. 
                    Do you want to kiss me?

      She's very close now. We can feel the chills shooting down 
      Sam's spine. He's scared and suddenly in love.                                  SAM
                    I ... uh ... I don't know.

                                  KIM
                    C'mon. Give me a kiss. I'll be your 
                      girlfriend.

      She moves in to kiss Sam. We see that every hormone in 
      Sam's body has gone into overdrive. His eyes are wide in 
      terror and anticipation. Suddenly, Kim's hand comes up and 
      slashes a huge red lipstick line across Sam's mouth and 
      cheek.

                                  KIM
                    In your dreams, retard.

      Kim pushes Sam against his locker, making the open metal 
      door BANG with a metallic rattle. Karen and Sue LAUGH 
      UPROARIOUSLY. Kim bursts out LAUGHING too and heads off 
      down the hall. Karen and Sue take off after her.

                                  KIM
                            (calling back to Sam)
                    Don't ever look at me again, geek, or 
                    I'll make you wish you'd never been 
                    born.

      She rounds the corner and is gone. Sam's against his 
      locker, staring after in shock. Students walk by, see the 
      lipstick on his face and start LAUGHING. Sam looks at them, 
      not knowing why they're laughing, then touches his face and 
      sees that he's got lipstick on his fingers. He looks 
      horrified and runs off to the bathroom.


      Sam is at the sink scrubbing his face with water. He looks 
      in the mirror. The lipstick is still there. RIIIING! The 
      school bell goes off. Sam looks up at the bell, then in the 
      mirror, SIGHS, and starts scrubbing his face again.

                                  MR. ROSSO (O.C.)
                    C'mon, whoever's in there. Let's get 
                    to class.

      Sam freezes. Turns off the water. Looks in the mirror. The 
      lipstick remains. Mr. Rosso enters. Sam hides his face in 
      the sink.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Sam? Is that you? What are you doing 
                    in here?

                                  SAM
                            (not looking up)
                    I think I'm sick, Mr. Rosso. I'm just 
                    cooling off. I'll be fine.

      Mr. Rosso looks puzzled, goes up to Sam and lifts Sam's 
      head. Sees the lipstick. Sam looks embarrassed and upset.                                  MR. ROSSO
                            (trying not to laugh)
                    Oh no, Sam. Who did this to you?

                                  SAM
                    Nobody.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Yeah? Well, then I have to tell you 
                    that red's not your color.

      Sam looks pained. Mr. Rosso gives him a sympathetic smile.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Don't worry. We'll go down to the 
                    nurse's office. She can get that off 
                    with a little alcohol.

      Mr. Rosso heads to the door. Stops when he sees Sam's not 
      moving.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Don't worry, everybody's in class. No 
                    one'll see you.

      Sam looks relieved and heads out with Mr. Rosso.


      Literature class. Ms. Collins, the English teacher, is 
      writing "GUSTAV FLAUBERT" on the chalkboard. Lindsay is 
      sitting in a desk in the back row. She has the book "Madame 
      Bovary" in front of her, as do the other students. She 
      looks hurt and confused from her run in with Kim.

                                  MS. COLLINS
                    Flaubert wrote "Madame Bovary" for a 
                    reason. It was to show us a ridiculous 
                    woman. A woman who allowed her fantasy 
                    life to ruin her real life.

      Lindsay is staring at the book on her desk. She fingers its 
      edges, riffles the pages with her thumb.

                                  MS. COLLINS
                    Madame Bovary is not an adult, yet 
                    she's not a child. 
                                  (MORE)                                  MS. COLLINS (CONT'D)
                    She's trapped herself in a world that 
                    simply cannot exist for her.

      Lindsay looks over at the window. It's a gray day outside. 
      She can see her reflection in the window. She stares at it. 

      Lindsay looks back at her book, troubled. Behind her, a 
      farmer guy puts the butt of his hand against his mouth and 
      makes a loud FART sound. The class LAUGHS. Ms. Collins 
      gives him a dirty look as Lindsay SIGHS and looks more 
      depressed than ever.


      Mr. Rosso and Sam head down the empty hall. Sam looks 
      around nervously, afraid someone'll see him with the 
      lipstick on.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Hey, Sam, can I ask you a question?

                                  SAM
                    Yeah.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    What's wrong with your sister?

      Sam gives him a puzzled look.

                                  SAM
                    Nothing. She's just weird.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    But she didn't used to be. Why's she 
                    throwing her life away?

      Sam gives Mr. Rosso an odd look.

                                  SAM
                    Is she?

      Suddenly, CHERYL KRAMER, a cute student who works in the 
      principal's office, comes around the corner with some 
      papers. She stops and sees Sam's lipstick. She covers her 
      mouth and starts LAUGHING.                                  CHERYL
                    Oh, my God ...

      Sam sees her laughing, throws Mr. Rosso a dirty look and 
      runs off to the nurse's office, covering his face. Mr. 
      Rosso gives Cheryl a dirty look.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Thanks, Cheryl. That's very helpful.


      Ms. Collins is addressing Nick, who's sitting with some 
      freaks.

                                  MS. COLLINS
                    Did you think that Madame Bovary was 
                    realistic in her expectations?

                                  NICK
                    I don't know, man. She was just 
                    stupid.

                                  MS. COLLINS
                    Thank you, Nick. I'll be sure to 
                    recommend you for the critic's job at 
                    The Literary Review.
                            (turning to Lindsay)
                    Lindsay, I liked your Freudian 
                    analysis of "The Bell Jar" last year. 
                    What do you think Dr. Freud would say 
                    about Flaubert's creation?

      Lindsay looks over at the freaks. They stare back at her. 
      She furrows her brow. Then looks away.

                                    LINDSAY
                    I didn't read it.

                                  MS. COLLINS
                            (truly surprised)
                    You didn't? What's the matter? Are you 
                    busy with the Decathlon?

      The class looks at her. She looks back at the freaks. They 
      look at her, unsure. Lindsay's face hardens.                                    LINDSAY
                    I didn't read the stupid book, okay? 
                    Just ask somebody else.

                                  MS. COLLINS
                    Lindsay, I'm going to assume you're 
                    having a bad day and move on. But this 
                    better be an isolated incident.

                                    LINDSAY
                            (staring at Ms. Collins)
                    Guess what? It's not.

      Lindsay gets up and walks out of the classroom. Ms. Collins 
      watches her go, concerned. FART! The farmer makes another 
      fart sound with his hand.

                                  MS. COLLINS
                      Seidelman, if you do that again, I 
                    swear to God I'll plant you like next 
                    year's crops.

      The farmer stifles his laughter as Nick and the rest of the 
      class look after the departed Lindsay, surprised.


      Lunchtime. The cafeteria is packed. TALKING. LAUGHING.

      IN THE LUNCHLINE

      students are lined up waiting for their hot lunch. Neal, 
      Bill, Art and Sam are there, working their way toward the 
      food.

                                  NEAL
                            (looking at lunch menu)
                    Hey, they're having Ben Franklin beans 
                    today.

                                  BILL
                    What makes them "Ben Franklin" beans?

                                  SAM
                    They're fat and they wear glasses.

      This cracks up the geeks. As they laugh, Sam looks toward 
      the front of the line. Standing by the silverware bins is       Alan White and his short bully entourage. ALAN PULLS A FORK 
      OUT OF THE BIN, LICKS IT AND PUTS IT BACK IN WITH THE OTHER 
      FORKS.

                                  BULLY #2
                    What'd you do that for?

                                  ALAN
                    I always do that.

      The bullies LAUGH. Sam is horrified. He continues to stare 
      as the thought of years of eating off forks from Alan's 
      mouth sinks in. Art sees Sam's face.

                                  ART
                    What's the matter?

                                  SAM
                            (aghast)
                    Alan White just licked a fork and put 
                    it back in with the others.

                                  ART
                    Gross.

                                  NEAL
                    My brother always does that when we go 
                    to the Sweden House smorgasbord.

                                  SAM
                    You mean people do that?

                                  NEAL
                    Yeah. They think it's funny.

      The geeks arrive at the silverware bins. Art, Bill and Neal 
      grab their trays and take their silverware. Sam stares at 
      the fork bin.

      There's a hundred forks jammed in there. No way to tell 
      which one was in Alan's mouth. Sam looks at the silverware, 
      his face contorted in disbelief and disgust.

                                  NEAL
                    Just grab one. You can wipe it off at 
                    the table.

      Sam looks dizzy. He gets out of line.                                   SAM
                    I'm gonna go to the snack counter. He 
                    leaves. Bill looks after him, 
                      incredulous.

                                  BILL
                    But you're gonna miss the Ben Franklin 
                    beans!

      IN THE BACK OF THE CAFETERIA

      The freaks are sitting around their lunch table, which is 
      next to the window and door leading to the smoking patio.

                                  NICK
                    Damn, Linds, that was so cool. She 
                    goes, "I'm outta here" and just books. 
                    Collins was crappin' her pants.

                                    LINDSAY
                    ... yeah.

      Kim, Karen and Sue walk up to the table. She points at 
      Lindsay.

                                  KIM
                    Could you tell that to move? We wanna 
                    sit here.

                                  NICK
                    Then grab a chair. There's room.

                                  KIM
                    I ain't sittin' here if she's here.

                                  DANIEL
                    Then don't sit here.

      Kim walks over to Lindsay and shoves her hard.

                                  KIM
                    Move, bitch.

                                  DANIEL (standing up)
                    Kim, man, I told you this morning. 
                    Lindsay's our friend. Just leave her 
                    alone and get outta here.                                  KIM
                    I'm not going anywhere.

      Lindsay stands up, faces Kim.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Kim, look, I'm sorry that you don't 
                    like me but these guys are my friends 
                    as much as they're your friends. So 
                    why don't you just sit down and I 
                    won't talk to you and you don't have 
                    to talk to me and we'll get on with 
                    our lives. Okay?

      Kim just stares at Lindsay blankly. Is she thinking about 
      it? There's no indication what's going on in her head. 
      Lindsay holds an almost parental look.

                                  KIM
                    Here's a better idea ...

      In one quick move, Kim reaches down, grabs Lindsay's bag 
      off her chair, holds it by the bottom and flings its 
      contents all over the cafeteria. Everybody nearby goes 
      SILENT.

                                  KIM
                    Why don't you just leave?

      Kim throws Lindsay's bag back at her. Lindsay looks at the 
      contents of her bag all over the floor. Sees the picture of 
      her grandmother lying by a garbage can. Without making eye 
      contact with Kim, she walks over and starts picking up her 
      stuff.

                                  NICK
                          (to kim)
                    What the hell'd you do that for? 
                    What's your problem?

                                  KIM
                    I don't have a problem. She's your 
                    problem now.

      Kim storms away. Nick, Ken and Daniel watch her go, 
      completely confused. Nick throws his hands in the air.                                  NICK
                    Chicks, man!

      AT THE GEEK TABLE

      Sam has a Hostess Cherry Pie, Twinkies and an empty package 
      of Ding Dongs in front of him. He's leaning on his elbows, 
      lost in thought, eating the Cherry Pie. Cindy Sanders comes 
      over and kneels down next to him.

                                  CINDY
                    Hey, Sam.

      Sam almost chokes when he sees it's her. He sits up 
      quickly.

                                  SAM
                    Cindy! Uh ... hi.

                                  CINDY
                    I forgot my chemistry book. Can I use 
                    your's for my next class? I'll give it 
                    back right after.

      Sam looks excited, then we see his face go blank.

      SAM'S FLASH OF THOUGHT

      We see Sam's chemistry book. Nightmare shots. Every page 
      has "I LOVE CINDY SANDERS" written on it in the margins.

      BACK TO SAM

                                  SAM
                    Oh, shoot. I left mine at home too. 
                    I'm sorry.

                                  CINDY
                    That's okay. I'll ask my friend 
                    Heather. Thanks.

      Cindy stands up just as Kim is storming by. Kim runs into 
      and shoves her away hard. Cindy stumbles against the table.

                                  KIM
                    Get outta my way, pom pom!

      Kim storms out of the cafeteria. We see Cindy's face fill       with indignation. She heads off after Kim. Sam watches, 
      surprised, then jumps up and heads after them, taking his 
      food with him.


      Kim storms through the trophy area toward the front doors. 
      Cindy's about ten feet behind her. 

                                  CINDY
                    Hey, excuse me. Excuse me!

      Kim stops at the front door and turns toward Cindy. Gives 
      her a "don't mess with me" look. Cindy stands with her 
      hands on her hips. Sam stops in the cafeteria doorway and 
      watches.

                                  CINDY
                    You shoved me.

                                  KIM
                    Yeah?

                                  CINDY
                    I think you should apologize.

                                  KIM
                    To you?

                                  CINDY
                    Yes. I think you were out of line.

      Kim walks toward Cindy as a crowd gathers. Cindy is the 
      very image of rich kid indignation.

                                  KIM
                    You want me to apologize?

      Kim walks right up to Cindy and shoves her back with all 
      her might. Cindy flies backwards and crashes into Sam, 
      whose junk food flies everywhere. They both fall to the 
      floor.

                                  KIM
                    There. I'm sorry.

      Kim turns and heads for the door. Cindy, possessed, jumps 
      up, runs at Kim and shoves her from behind. Kim flies into       the front door and hits it hard. It RATTLES loudly. Sam 
      jumps up and heads over to Cindy.

                                  SAM
                    Cindy, don't.

      Kim turns and glares daggers at Cindy. There's definitely 
      going to be a fight. However, Sam gets in between them.

                                  SAM
                    C'mon, you guys. Don't fight.

      Kim storms over and pushes Sam hard, knocking him down.

                                  KIM
                    I told you not to talk to me, geek! 
                    I'll kick your ass after I kick Miss 
                      Perfect's.

                                    LINDSAY (O.C.)
                    You're not kicking anyone's ass.

      Kim looks over just in time to see Lindsay coming at her. 
      Lindsay shoves Kim hard. Kim stumbles back, then her face 
      fills with rage. She springs at Lindsay and the fight is 
      on.

      Students gather around. The fight is fairly vicious. Lots 
      of misplaced anger. Alan and the bullies burst through the 
      crowd.

                                  ALAN
                    Whoa, girl fight! Cool!

      They start CHEERING as do some other students in the crowd. 
      Most just stare, surprised. Sam looks on, stunned. Cindy 
      stands next to him, looking at the scene in horror.


      Mr. Rosso is at his desk, talking to someone we can't see.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    The thing is, I just really need some 
                    help figuring out what's wrong with 
                    her.

      Mr. Rosso hears the COMMOTION OUTSIDE. Gets up.                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Huh boy. It never ends. Excuse me a 
                    second, would you?

      Mr. Rosso exits as we PULL BACK to reveal that he's been 
      talking to Lindsay's parents. Harold and Jean turn and look 
      after Mr. Rosso, then get up and follow.


      Mr. Rosso comes out to find a huge crowd of students 
      gathered around the fight. VOICES. SCREAMS. He pushes his 
      way through the crowd toward its center.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    All right, all right. Break it up!

      He comes into the fight area and separates the two 
      combatants. He's surprised when he sees it's Lindsay.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Lindsay? What's going on?

                                  KIM
                    That bitch pushed me!

      Cindy Sanders steps forward, her face filled with regret.

                                  CINDY
                    It was all my fault, Mr. Rosso. I 
                    started all this.

      Mr. Rosso gives Cindy a "you've gotta be kidding" look. Sam 
      steps forward.

                                  SAM
                    It was Kim. She pushed Cindy over. 
                    Lindsay was just defending her.

      Sam, Cindy and Kim all start TALKING at once, pleading 
      their cases.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Wait a minute!
                            (turns to Lindsay)
                    Lindsay, what happened?

      Lindsay's trying to be tough but the armor is cracking.                                    LINDSAY
                    Nothing.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Who started this?

                                    LINDSAY
                    I started it. The day I was born. The 
                    day I wish never happened.

                                  JEAN (O.C.)
                    Lindsay!

      Lindsay looks over to see her mom and dad standing there. 
      She can't believe it. They stare at her, surprised, 
      confused, hurt.

                                  KIM
                    Glad to see mommy and daddy came to 
                    save you.

      Lindsay looks at Kim. Kim's smirking. Lindsay looks around 
      at the crowd staring at her silently, then back at her 
      parents. Then she turns and pushes through the crowd.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Lindsay, wait.

      Lindsay runs out of the school. As she runs, we MOVE with 
      her. We see her face. It's filled with pain and 
        humiliation. She runs past us, leaving us looking back at 
      the stunned crowd through the front of the school.


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                      ACT THREE


      Sam, Art, Neal and Bill are walking down the hall between 
      classes. The hallway is crowded.

                                  SAM
                    I've kinda got a headache.

                                  NEAL
                    Yeah, no doubt. You ate a ton of sugar 
                    at lunch.

                                  SAM
                    That doesn't give you a headache.

                                  NEAL
                    Sure it does. My dad's a dentist and 
                    he always tells me that the worst 
                    thing you can do to your body is eat 
                    sugar on an empty stomach. You shoulda 
                    ate the Ben Franklin beans like us 
                    instead of being afraid of a spitty 
                    fork.

                                  SAM
                    I wasn't afraid of it. Besides, it was 
                    gross.

                                  NEAL
                    Alan just licked it. It evaporated 
                      immediately.

                                  SAM
                    But it was in his mouth.

                                  BILL
                    My cousin told me that once Frank 
                    Zappa passed a cup around the audience 
                    at a concert and had everyone spit in 
                    it and then he drank it.

                                  SAM (horrified)
                    Really?

                                  NEAL
                    That's not true.                                  BILL
                    Of course it's true. My cousin told 
                    me.

                                  NEAL
                    Is this the same cousin that told you 
                    Mister Greenjeans is Charles Manson's 
                    father?

                                  BILL
                    No. He said he was Frank Zappa's 
                    father, so I think he knows a little 
                    more about Frank Zappa than you, Neal.

      Neal just rolls his eyes. Suddenly, the guys see something 
      and stop. They stare.

      A couple is making out passionately next to a locker. It's 
      MARK PHELPS and JULIE CANTORE, the class couple. They both 
      walk the line between being popular kids and geeks. But 
      they definitely lean more toward popular.

      Sam, Neal and Art stare at the couple and we can tell they 
      all wish it was them instead of Mark making out with Julie. 
      Bill just looks put off.

                                  BILL
                    Gross.

                                  NEAL
                    Yeah, real gross.
                          (to Sam)
                    What are you gonna do about something 
                    like that? That's spit too, you know.

      Sam thinks about it. His face shows confusion. Then ...

                                  VOICE (O.C.)
                    CLEAN OUT!

      Before Sam can react, Alan runs up behind him and knocks 
      Sam's books and notebook out from under his arm. The books 
      CLUMP onto the floor and the notebook CLICKS open on 
      impact. All Sam's papers WHOOSH out all over the floor.

      Alan and his entourage LAUGH and shuffle their feet as they 
      walk through Sam's papers, kicking them all over the       hallway.

                                  ALAN
                    You oughta learn how to fight like 
                    your sister, Weird!

      And they're gone. Sam just stares sadly down at the mess. 
      Neal, Bill and Art stare at the mess also. After a beat ...

                                  NEAL
                    Well, I'd better get to class.

                                  BILL
                    Yeah, me too.

      Neal and Bill take off. Sam watches them go.

                                  ART
                    C'mon, I'll help you.

      Art kneels down and starts gathering papers. Sam SIGHS and 
      does the same.


      The class is standing around in their gym outfits, waiting 
      for class to begin. Sam, Art, Neal and Bill are standing 
      amidst the group.

                                  ART
                          (to sam)
                    My mom said I could invite you over 
                    for dinner tonight. You wanna come?

                                  SAM
                    Yeah. I'll have to ask my mom.

                                  NEAL
                    Am I invited?

                                  ART
                            (embarrassed)
                    Um ... no. My mom only lets me invite 
                    over people she knows.                                  NEAL
                    Well, how's she gonna get to know 
                    anyone if she never lets them come 
                    over?

                                  BILL
                    Can I come over for dinner tonight, 
                    too?

                                  NEAL
                    Does his mom know you?

                                  BILL
                    I don't know. I never met her.

                                  MR. FREDERICKS (O.C.)
                    All right, you guys. Quiet down.

      Mr. Fredericks comes into the gym. Behind him is a large, 
      paunchy COP in full uniform. He has a handlebar mustache 
      and a big, red face.

      A group of freaks see the cop. They immediately look guilty 
      and sink down behind a group of farmers to hide. Mr. 
      Fredericks brings the cop before the class.

                                  MR. FREDERICKS
                    Today's a special day. We're gonna 
                    learn all about CPR, so I want you to 
                    give our guest your full and undivided 
                      attention.
                          (to a big farmer guy)
                    Got that, Siedelman?

                                  FARMER GUY
                            (trying not to laugh)
                    Got it, Mr. Fredericks.

      Mr. Fredericks motions to the cop, who steps forward.

                                  SGT. KORN
                    Good day, gentlemen. My name is 
                    Sergeant Korn.

      SNICKERS. COUGHING in attempts to not laugh. The cop looks 
      like he's more than used to the response and continues.                                  SGT. KORN
                    Today, I'm going to demonstrate the 
                    proper technique for administering 
                    Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation, or 
                    CPR. This is the most effective means 
                    for reviving a victim of choking or 
                    heart attack at your disposal. But in 
                    order to demonstrate the technique, 
                    I'm going to need a little help ... 
                    from Annie.

      Sgt. Korn motions to the locker room door like a game show 
      host.

                                  NEAL (to Sam)
                    Whoa, we're gonna have a girl in gym 
                    class. Cool.

      Sam looks in anticipation. Instead, Mark Phelps, the male 
      half of the school couple, emerges from the locker room 
      with a body slung over his shoulder. The class reacts, some 
      with GASPS, others with laughter. Mark smiles and waves to 
      the group.

                                  MARK
                    Hey, guys!

      Sam and his gang watch as Mark brings over the body and 
      hands it to Sgt. Korn. It's a dummy of a woman. Sgt. Korn 
      holds the dummy up as if it were a person.

                                  SGT. KORN
                      Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Resusa 
                    Annie, the best friend a guy who wants 
                    to learn CPR ever had.

      Sam stares at the dummy. It's really quite horrifying. The 
      face is fairly lifelike, but it's made out of a pale rubber 
      that makes it look like a dead person.

      Sam studies it, his face showing his repulsion. The dummy's 
      eyes are closed and its mouth is open in a cadaver-like 
      position. It has dirty matted hair and wears an old blue 
      jogging suit. This Resusa-Annie looks a little worse for 
      wear.                                  ALAN
                            (calling over to sam)
                    Hey, Weird, it's your mom!

      The class LAUGHS. Sam furrows his brow. Mr. Fredericks 
      forces himself not to laugh.

                                  MR. FREDERICKS
                    All right, White, put a sock in it. 
                    Sergeant?

      Sgt. Korn puts Resusa-Annie on the gym floor and kneels 
      down next to it.

                                  SGT. KORN
                    Okay, guys, gather around and I'll 
                    show you how it's done.

      The students move forward.


      We PAN across the faces of the guys in gym class. They are 
      all watching something. They elbow each other and stifle 
      their laughter. PAN ENDS on Sam. He has a look of disgust.

      CUT TO REVEAL that Sgt. Korn is on his knees giving Resusa 
      Annie mouth to mouth. He blows into the dummy and the chest 
      rises and falls. He pulls away from the dummy's mouth and       sits back.

                                  SGT. KORN
                    And that's how you perform CPR. Oh, 
                    and remember that before you blow into 
                    the person's mouth, use your finger to 
                    make sure that there's nothing inside 
                    the mouth, such as gum or a mint.

                                  SAM (sotto to Art)
                    We're supposed to stick our finger in 
                    someone's mouth?

      Art shrugs and Sam makes a "never in a million years" face. 
      Sgt. Korn stands up.

                                  SGT. KORN
                    So, you think you guys got it?

      The class MUMBLES in the affirmative. Sam looks at Art, 
      excited.

                                  SAM
                    Hey, you think that's it? Do we get 
                    out early today?

                                  ART
                    I hope so.

                                  SGT. KORN
                    All right, everybody. Line up. You're 
                    all gonna take a turn.

      A Hitchcock DOLLY IN/ZOOM OUT on Sam's face. He looks 
      absolutely panic stricken. His eyes dart down to Resusa 
      Annie on the floor. The pale rubber skin. The open mouth, 
      now wet from Sgt. Korn's spit.

                                  SAM
                    ... oh, no ...

                                  SGT. KORN
                    Now, I know some of you guys might be 
                    worried about germs, so I'm going to 
                    use alcohol to wipe this off between 
                    each student.

      Sgt. Korn produces a very clinical looking bottle of       alcohol and a sad looking rag. He slops some alcohol onto 
      the rag, then wipes it across the dummy's mouth. The mouth 
      and face glistens with wetness.

                                  BILL
                    Alcohol? What if I get drunk for my 
                    next class? I've gotta make a pot.

                                  NEAL
                    It's not that kind of alcohol, dummy.
                            (sees Sam's panicked face)
                    What's the matter?

                                  SAM
                    I ... uh ... I can't ... uh ...

                                  MR. FREDERICKS
                    All right, you guys. You heard the 
                    sergeant. Line up. The guys all get 
                    into line.

      Neal hops to and rushes to the front of the line.

                                  NEAL
                    Cool. I've always wanted to try CPR.

      Art and Bill head off to the line. Sam, however, stays 
      frozen. He looks around in an absolute panic. He sees Neal 
      kneel down and put his mouth onto Annie's. Sam swallows 
      hard and starts toward the locker room.

                                  MR. FREDERICKS
                    Weir, where do you think you're going?

                                  SAM
                    I ... uh ... have to get something out 
                    of my locker.

                                  MR. FREDERICKS
                    It can wait. Get back here and line 
                    up.

      Sam just stares at Resusa-Annie. CLOSE on its mouth. Neal 
      pulls away. The mouth is wet. Sgt. Korn's hand comes in and 
      sloppily pulls the alcohol-soaked rag across the mouth, 
      leaving it wet. Mr. Fredericks walks toward Sam.                                  SAM
                    Hey, I said get in line!

                                  SAM
                            (trying to talk quietly)
                    Mr. Fredericks, I think it's against 
                    my family's religion to do this.

                                  MR. FREDERICKS
                    Weir, I don't care if you're the Pope. 
                    Get in line.

      Sam looks around. The guys in line are staring at him as 
      students continue to give mouth to mouth to Resusa-Annie.

                                  ALAN
                    What's the matter, Weir? You waitin' 
                    for them to bring out Resusa-Danny?

      The class LAUGHS. Sgt. Korn looks at Sam.

                                  SGT. KORN
                    C'mon, son. It's for your own good. 
                    You could save a life someday.

      Sam looks like a trapped animal. His eyes dart around the 
      gym but there's no hope of escape. He trudges over to the 
      back of the line. Bill is standing in front of him.

                                  BILL
                    I guess you're after me.

      Sam's eyes zero in on Bill's mouth. Since Bill is 
      officially "slow," his mouth is permanently ajar and his 
      lips are large, droopy and wet. Sam looks queasy. His face 
      goes white and he starts to sweat.

                                  BILL
                    Are you okay?

      Sam looks terrible. Sgt. Korn sees Sam and calls Mr. 
      Fredericks over. The two confer.

                                  SAM
                    I just need some air.

      Mr. Fredericks comes over and takes Sam by the arm.                                  MR. FREDERICKS
                    C'mon, Weir. I'm gonna take you to the 
                    front of the line so you can get it 
                    over with. Everybody's gotta do it. 
                    It's the law.

      Sam looks too queasy and dizzy to even resist. He stumbles 
      along behind Mr. Fredericks.

                                  ALAN
                    Hey, look at Weir. I think he's gonna 
                    cry.

                                  FARMER GUY
                    Yeah, he probably wishes Resusa-Annie 
                    was Resusa-Danny!

                                  ALAN
                            (punches farmer hard on arm)
                    I already said that, Seidelman.

      Mr. Fredericks brings Sam to Resusa-Annie. Sam kneels down 
      before it. Stares at the pale rubber face. The matted hair.

                                  SGT. KORN
                    Remember, son. Just pinch the nose and 
                    blow.

      Sam closes his eyes and starts to bend down toward it. Once 
      he's there, he opens his eyes. The pale, corpse-like face. 
      Sam stares into the wet mouth. The lips are apart slightly. 
      It's dark inside the mouth.

                                  SGT. KORN
                    Just put your finger in the mouth to 
                    check for blockage. That's it.

      Sam's eyes roll back in his head and he faints.

      ALL SOUND GOES ECHOEY as we go inside Sam's head. The gym 
      is out of focus and spinning.

      The students all run over and gather around. THROUGH SAM'S 
      EYES, we see all their faces staring down at him.

                                  NEAL
                    He fainted.                                  BILL
                    I think he had a heart attack.

                                  ALAN
                    What a queer!

                                  ART
                    Sam, can you hear me?

      Sgt. Korn's big arm comes in and sweeps the students back. 
      The sergeant looks down at Sam.

                                  SGT. KORN
                    Step back, fellas. I'll handle this.

      The sergeant's face, handlebar mustache and all, comes 
      toward us as his mouth opens to deliver mouth-to-mouth 
      resuscitation. SAM'S EYES go wide. We hear a SCREAM.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      Sam is sitting in a chair in his gym clothes with a 
      thermometer in his mouth and a glass of orange juice in his 
      hand. He looks humiliated. The NURSE walks over and checks 
      the thermometer.

                                  NURSE
                    Well, your temperature's normal. I 
                    guess it must have been a hypoglycemic 
                    reaction to all the sugar you had for 
                    lunch. You've got to eat nutritiously. 
                    Okay?

      Sam just gives her a defeated look. She LAUGHS.

                                  NURSE
                    Okay, go on.

      Sam gets up and goes to the door. Puts his hand on the knob 
      and is about to open the door when he suddenly stops. Looks 
      down, remembering he's in his gym shorts.

                                  NURSE
                    Anything the matter?

                                  SAM
                            (turning to nurse)
                    Can I stay in here the rest of the 
                    day?

                                  NURSE
                    Sorry, Sam. You're fine. You'd better 
                    get to your next class.

      Sam gives her a look of dread, SIGHS, and slowly opens the 
      door.


      The halls are crowded with students. Sam's head appears out 
      of the nurse's door. He looks up and down the hall, then 
      slowly comes out in his gym shorts. Tugs at the bottoms in 
      the hopes that they'll miraculously turn into long pants. 
      Sam takes a deep breath and wades out into the crowd. 
      Almost instantly ...                                  ALAN
                    Hey, there's the girl that fainted in 
                    gym class!

                                  BULLY #2
                    Hey, Weird, after he kissed you, did 
                    Sergeant Korn show you his cob?

      They break up LAUGHING, as do most other students within 
      earshot. A bunch of farmers from gym class come over.

                                    FARMERS
                            (chanting)
                    Wuss-y, wuss-y, wuss-y ...

      Alan and the bullies join in. Sam looks horrified and takes 
      off running back to the locker room, running past Diane 
      Crebs and her girlfriends.

                                  DIANE
                    Hey, kid, nice knees!

      They scream with LAUGHTER as Sam disappears around the 
      corner.


      Sam comes out of the locker room, back in his school 
      clothes and carrying his books. The hall is empty. Sam sees 
      he's late for class.

                                  SAM
                    Oh, man ...

      He sprints off down the hall. Suddenly, the door to the 
      girls' bathroom swings open. CRACK! Sam runs right into it, 
      full force. His books go flying and he falls back onto the 
      ground. Kim Kelly comes out of the bathroom.

                                  KIM
                    What the hell ...?

      She looks and sees Sam lying on the floor, holding his face 
      in pain. She starts LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.

                                  KIM
                    Oh, my God. You ran into the door!

      Kim's in hysterics. Sam's really hurt. He's clutching his 
      nose and writhing around in agony. MOANING. Kim continues 
      to laugh but starts to see that Sam's really in pain. She 
      walks over to him. Taps his leg with her foot.

                                  KIM
                    Hey, you stupid geek, get up.

      Sam takes his hands away from his face for a second. His 
      nose is bleeding profusely and he's got blood on his palms. 
      This freaks both he and Kim.

                                  KIM & SAM
                    Oh, my God!

      Kim looks around for someone to help but no one's there. 
      She looks down at Sam who sits up but is still clutching 
      his nose.

                                  SAM
                    I think it's broken.

                                  KIM
                    Oh, crap. Well ... go to the nurse's 
                    office, you retard.      Sam looks at his bloody hands again. He looks like he's in 
      shock. Looks absolutely helpless.

                                  SAM
                    I can't. I ...

      He just grabs his nose again. He's scared. Kim looks around 
      again, SIGHS, then bends down and helps him up.

                                  KIM
                    All right, c'mon. I'll take you.

      She gets Sam up and helps him down the hall. Sam's pretty 
      woozy. He looks at Kim through his haze.

                                  SAM
                    Why are you being nice to me?

                                  KIM
                    I'm not. I just don't want you to 
                    bleed to death 'cause then I'll get 
                    blamed.

                                  SAM
                    That's still being nice ... I think.

                                  KIM
                    Just shut up.

                                  SAM
                            (after a beat)
                    Why are you so mean to my sister?

                                  KIM
                    Hey, I said shut up, didn't I? I'll 
                    leave you here.

                                  SAM
                    You shouldn't be mean to her. She's 
                    having a hard time.

                                  KIM
                    Oh, gee, is she? And I've been having 
                    the time of my life.

                                  SAM
                    She's all sad because our grandma 
                    died.                                  KIM
                    Hey, I'd be happy. I hate my grandma.

                                  SAM
                    But Lindsay didn't hate ours. They 
                    were best friends.

                                  KIM
                    Nobody's best friends with old people. 
                    Old people suck. Adults suck. (after a 
                    beat) Parents suck.

      This seems to take Kim into her own world. She continues 
      helping Sam down the hall. Sam stares at her but she's 
      clammed up. She stops in front of the door to the nurse's 
      office.

                                  KIM
                    All right, here. Now, go in and tell 
                    them how stupid you are.

                                  SAM
                            (sincere)
                    Thanks, Kim. Thanks for helping me. 
                    You're not as mean as I thought you 
                    were.

      He gives her a smile, which obviously makes his nose hurt. 
      He flinches in pain and goes inside. Kim doesn't respond.

                                  NURSE (O.C.)
                            (through the door)
                    Oh, no. Not you again.

      Kim stares at the door for a beat, troubled, deep in 
      thought. Then she turns and heads off down the hall.


      RING! Classes let out for the day as happy students run 
      into the hallway. LOCKERS SLAM. LAUGHTER. The joy of the 
      end of a school day. Sam comes out of the nurse's office 
      with a large white bandage covering his nose. He looks 
      miserable. Neal and Bill approach. Bill starts to LAUGH.

                                  BILL
                    Hey, look, it's Ru--

                                  SAM
                    Bill, if you say anything, I'll kill 
                    you.

                                  BILL
                    I was ... uh ... just gonna say, "it's 
                    Sam."

                                  NEAL
                    So, you gonna fill us in on your new 
                    look?

                                  SAM
                    I'll tell you on the bus. Let's just 
                    get out of here.

      Sam heads off, desperate to escape his bad day. Neal and 
      Bill follow, elbowing each other and trying not to laugh.


      Sam, Neal and Bill are on the bus. Sam is crouched down, 
      hiding his bandaged nose from the other riders as they get 
      on. Kim and her friends get on and head to the back.

      As Kim passes, she looks at Sam. Sees his bandage. Just 
      shakes her head and rolls her eyes as Sam gives her a 
      sheepish smile. Kim heads off to the back of the bus. Sam 
      looks pleased with himself.

      There's a TAPPING on Sam's window. He looks out. It's Art. 
      Art yells through the glass.

                                  ART
                    Are you okay? I was wondering where 
                    you were last period.

      Sam just points at the bandage on his nose.

                                  ART
                    Is that from when you fainted?

      Sam shakes his head "no," then mimes opening a door and 
      getting hit in the nose. He makes a cross-eyed, cartoon 
      face. Art LAUGHS.

                                  ART
                    You still coming over for dinner?

      Sam shakes his head "yes." Art looks pleased and holds up 
      the Star Trek "live long and prosper" finger signal. Sam 
      does it back and Art heads off.        A thirty-something BUS DRIVER guy with very long blond hair 
      and a beard gets on the bus. He stands at the front and 
      addresses the students. He's a real product of the 60's.

                                  BUS DRIVER
                    Hi, everyone. Peace. My name is Steve 
                    and I'm your new bus driver. I know 
                    you guys have had trouble with bus 
                    drivers before and I can relate to 
                    that. I have a hard time with the 
                      establishment too. Adults can be a 
                    real drag.
                            (laughs)
                    But I just want you to know that since 
                    we're all close to the same age, I'm 
                    here to help you guys. If you ever 
                    have any problems with anything -- 
                    school, your parents, your boyfriend 
                    or girlfriend -- just come up front 
                    here and when I'm done driving you 
                    home safely, we'll rap and see if we 
                    can't straighten your head out. Okay? 
                    That sound groovy?

      STUNNED SILENCE. Then ...

                                  KIM
                    Just shut up and drive the bus, ya 
                    stupid hippie!

      Karen and Sue LAUGH. The bus driver's face goes blank, as 
      he realizes he's not in Kansas anymore.

                                  BUS DRIVER (to himself)
                    ... uh oh ...


      Harold, Jean and Lindsay are eating dinner. Harold looks 
      around.

                                  HAROLD
                    Where's Sam?

                                  JEAN
                    At Art's.                                  HAROLD
                    Oh.

      They eat in silence, Harold and Jean looking at Lindsay but 
      not sure what to say. Harold makes a "say something" face 
      at Jean, who makes the exact same face back at him.

      Harold sends it back to Jean, this time mouthing "You're 
      her mother." Jean makes a face, then takes a breath and 
      prepares to speak. Just as she opens her mouth ...

                                    LINDSAY
                          (to jean)
                    You wanna go to the mall after school 
                    tomorrow?

                                  JEAN
                            (thrown)
                    ... huh?

                                    LINDSAY
                    I thought we could go shopping, maybe 
                    get a Coney Island. We haven't done 
                    that in a while.

                                  JEAN
                    Uh ... yeah ... uh ... sure. That 
                    sounds great, Linds.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Yeah.

      Lindsay gives her mom a quick smile and goes back to 
      eating. Jean and Harold look at each other. Shocked. Harold 
      shrugs, as if to say "don't question it." Jean looks back 
      at Lindsay, then smiles happily.

      The family goes back to eating, everyone looking quite 
      happy. At least for tonight.

                                                                            FADE OUT.
