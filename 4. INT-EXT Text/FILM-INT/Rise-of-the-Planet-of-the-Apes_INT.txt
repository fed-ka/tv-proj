WILL RODMAN - late twenties, lab coat over a T-shirt and
jeans - stands at the glass, watching the terrified
chimpanzee slide into the machine.
The focus in his eyes belies the casual dress.
WILL
Start the scan.
A TECHIE sits at a computer screen beside Will.
3.
TECHIE
Scanning.
Another tech, DONNIE - skinny, tattooed - controls the
machine, sending the restrained animal into the scanner.
Caroline moves to an IV STAND beside the scan. The bag's
full of a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN LIQUID.
DONNIE
Stuff looks like Kool-aid.
CAROLINE
Go ahead, I'm sure you could use
it.
(OPENING VALVE)
Starting the therapy...
Will looks at a monitor showing the BRAIN SCAN OF THE CHIMP.
The image starts to shake. Concerned, he looks to the other
room - where he can see the CHIMP'S LEGS SHAKING IN THEIR
RESTRAINTS.
FRANKLIN
She's convulsing.
Caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube, listens to Bright
Eyes' heart.
WILL
(INTO INTERCOM)
Please keep the monkey still.
He focuses back on the monitor.
CAROLINE (INTERCOM)
She's not a monkey.
Will looks from the monitor to Caroline. His look is
intense, tough to read. She blushes slightly at the heat of
his gaze.
CAROLINE (INTERCOM) (CONT'D)
She's an ape. Chimpanzees,
gorillas and orangutans, they're
all apes.
4.
WILL
Good to know. Just keep it from
moving.
She's stung, wonders, why does he have to be such a jerk
sometimes.
He's oblivious to this, instead intent on getting the scan
right. The green liquid moves through the chimp's neck...
TECHIE
Here we go.
Will stares at the scan, his eyes willing the test to
succeed.. .the green liquid LIGHTS UP THE CHIMP'S BRAIN.
CHEER FROM THE GROUP.
Will fights a CONTRACTION OF EXTREME EMOTION that passes
across his face. He quickly hides it - offers up a smile for
the others.
WILL
We're on our way.
(BEAT)
Good work.
CAROLINE
What is this?
Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes, who
sits at a table in front of a LEXIGRAM, a lit-up board with
colorful symbols.
Bright Eyes presses a button.
ELECTRONIC VOICE
Tree.
SUPER: "ONE MONTH LATER."
Caroline holds up a picture of an acorn.
CAROLINE
And this?
The chimp presses another button.
ELECTRONIC VOICE
Acorn.
5.
CAROLINE
Where does the acorn come from?
Bright Eyes considers... then presses a button.
ELECTRONIC VOICE
Acorn.
CAROLINE
Yes, but where does the acorn come
from?
ELECTRONIC VOICE
Acorn.
CAROLINE
NO -
Bright Eyes interrupts, now pressing three buttons.
ELECTRONIC VOICE
Acorn. Tree. Acorn.
The chimp looks at Caroline, who's stunned, trying to process
the ADVANCED THINKING JUST MANIFESTED. Then she presses
another button.
ELECTRONIC VOICE (CONT'D)
Surprise.
The unnatural voice - paired with Bright Eyes' eerily human-
like gaze - is somehow CREEPY... The IMAGE FREEZES and we...
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WILL'S OFFICE
Diplomas on the wall, books everywhere. Bright Eyes looks
out at Will from a computer screen. He's got two CT SCANS
sitting on the desk in front of him.
CAROLINE
We started the therapy four weeks
ago. This was yesterday.
Will's studying the scans. They look good. Real good.
CAROLINE (CONT'D)
There's been clear cell growth.
Both on the frontal lobe and the
neocortex.
She's purposely standing close in order to point this out.
He notices but doesn't respond - there's history between them
and he's regretting that - gets in the way.
6.
WILL
I see that. But I don't understand
the primate behavioral norms. She
knows an acorn's a seed. Wouldn't
any monkey know that?
CAROLINE
No - it's conceptual. Acorn gives
us a tree, which gives us an acorn.
WILL
Abstract thought...
CAROLINE
In a chimpanzee. Unheard of.
Will turns the possibilities over in his mind. Caroline
moves away from him. He barely notices her now.
CAROLINE (CONT'D)
You're calling her a monkey just to
piss me off, aren't you?
WILL
Start the other's on the 112.
(BEAT)
And double this one's dose.
WALTER RODMAN, 60, sits at the piano dressed in a robe,
stabbing at the key with his finger.
Will enters, his posture almost visually changing with the
emotional weight of this man, his father.
WILL
Hey Dad.
Walter looks up, whispers...
WALTER
John... is that you?
WILL
It's me. Will.
WALTER
As thou dost, Anthony.
(staring at the keys)
.he hears no music. No music...
VOICE
(heavy Russian accent)
He's been doing that all day.
A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA.
IRENA
He found an old book of his.
She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's
pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back.
IRENA (CONT'D)
(shrugging on coat)
I had no idea you liked Shakespeare
so much, Mr. Walter.
WILL
My mother was the one. She liked
Shakespeare...
IRENA
(KISSES HIM)
Good night, Walter, hone-ee.
She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm.
I WILL
Come on, Dad.
8.
Will helps his father change into pajamas.
WILL
Remember I told you we were using
Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on
the apes? Well the therapy seems
to be working. We've seen definite
signs of adult brain neurogenesis.
Walter holds up his arms for Will to slide on the pajama top.
WILL (CONT'D)
Board of Directors is coming in a
couple weeks to talk about Phase 2 -
that's clinical trials.
Walter gives no hint he's even listening, much less
understanding what Will's saying.
WILL (CONT'D)
Human trials, Dad. Soon.
WALTER
I rather tell that what is to be
feared than what I fear: for
always... I am Caesar...
There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries..
WILL
I'm going to make you better - I
swear it.
His father looks at him. A moment of recognition?
WALTER
John... ?
WILL
(DISAPPOINTED)
No, Dad, it's me. Will.
Will helps the old man under the bedcovers.
WILL (CONT'D)
John's gone.
He moves to the door, pausing to take in the diplomas on the
walls - Walter's name on all of them. (Physics, Astronomy.)
9.
Will looks at his father lying there on his back, staring up
at the ceiling. The once brilliant man now slipping away.
It's late. Signs of a half-eaten frozen dinner on the desk
beside numerous papers, charts, and Will's computer.
He looks exhausted, gulps from a cup of coffee as he works.
Franklin moves from cage to cage, greeting the apes.
FRANKLIN
Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam.
Monty. Hey - what's the matter,
don't like my cooking?
SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER
He pauses in front of Bright Eyes, huddled at the back of her
cage.
FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
You okay back there?
CAROLINE
Something wrong with Bright Eyes?
FRANKLIN
I'll check on her when we're done.
Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the
next room, where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner.
Lucky's head is shaved, exposing a long, curving scar on his
cranium.
From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open
door as Lucky's strapped down.
From the back of her cage, Bright Eyes watches through the
open door as the ape on the table convulses.
CAROLINE
Okay. Back it out...
DONNIE
Your turn.
Bright Eyes RUSHES FORWARD, HER HANDS GRIPPING THE BARS SO
DONNIE CAN'T OPEN THE CAGE.
DONNIE (CONT'D)
C'mon - Let go -
She understands what he wants but she won't do it. THAT'S
WHEN HE NOTICES: HER HANDS ARE BLOODY.
DONNIE (CONT'D)
Hey! Something's wrong with number
four!
Franklin looks over - he's still dealing with Lucky on the
table...
FRANKLIN
Be right over -
Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes. There's something
different in her face today. Rage? Force of will?
DONNIE
What's the matter with you?
Will stands at the head of a table. A BIG PLASMA SCREEN
behind him shows a BLOW UP OF A BRAIN SCAN. As Will speaks,
he gestures at it with a LASER POINTER.
11.
WILL
0
(AWKWARD)
Alzheimer's affects the entire
neocortex, the hippocampus, and
large subcortical regions of the
brain...
Donnie and Bright Eyes are at a standoff. Once more he tries
to open the cage, once more she yanks it shut.
Again he tries... and is taken by surprise when SHE GRABS HIS
HAND AND PULLS IT THROUGH THE BARS.
DONNIE
Hey!!!
Now Donnie's smashed up against the bars. Hard. The other
apes begin to SCREECH.
Donnie hasn't panicked quite yet, but he's about to.
DONNIE (CONT'D)
Someone get her off of me!
CAROLINE
Hang on -
Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries
over. He eyes the chimps in their cages - GOING CRAZY.
Will continues his presentation. Stevens looks around at the
board members - they're lost.
WILL
In the past, it's been impossible
to target specific areas, both
because of the Blood Brain Barrier -
Jacobs stands, interrupting Will.
JACOBS
What Dr. Rodman has done is to
invent a virus that can, for the
first time, cross the membrane that
protects the brain and deliver a
genetic, therapeutic, payload.
0
12.
WILL
(trying to sell)
This 'payload' would directly
affect the areas of memory, higher
function - and, of course, the
motherlode: intelligence.
The board members stare, trying to comprehend.
BOARD MEMBER
Meaning?
WILL
Meaning.
(deep breath here)
If Phase 2 goes as planned, we're
looking at a cure for Alzheimer's.
With an elbow prompting from Jacobs, Will takes a SAMPLE VIAL
from his jacket pocket and awkwardly holds it up for dramatic
effect.
DONNIE
She's breaking my hand!
CAROLINE
Let go, Bright Eyes! You're
hurting him!
She tries to help pull Donnie away.
CAROLINE (CONT'D)
Let go!
In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own.
LUCKY - RILED UP FROM THE COMMOTION IN BRIGHT EYES' CAGE AND
THE SCREAMING FROM THE OTHER CHIMPS - BREAKS AWAY.
HE CRASHES OUT OF THE LAB, DRAGGING HIS LEASH.
FRANKLIN
Lucky no! Stop!
(TO CAROLINE)
Hit the alarm!
Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it.
DONNIE'S SCREAMS BECOME OTHERWORLDLY AS WE GO TO...
13.
LOUD BEEPING as two GUARDS look to a BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN
of a corridor. They see Lucky dragging his leash as he
scampers - unattended - down the hall.
GUARD #1
Uh oh.
Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN
SILENT AGONY, PUSHED UP AGAINST THE CAGE, CAROLINE TRYING TO
GET HIM FREE.
GUARD #2
Hey, Len...?
Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket...
Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet...
The room is still thrumming with the excitement of Will's
pronouncement.
BOARD MEMBER
What about the safety of the virus?
WILL
Perfectly safe. We're using the
most stable -
A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS.
Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW.
WILL (CONT'D)
NO!
Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and
pinning him to the wall. It happens fast.
The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw, exposing DEADLY
INCISORS...
 BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK.
The chimp turns, leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again.
14.
Will watches as the chimp - and all of Will's dreams -
collapses on the boardroom table.
Will stands at the fringes of the room, watching MEN IN
HAZMAT SUITS pull down SHELVES OF METAL CANISTERS LABELED ADV
112.
His work - destroyed.
The cages are empty, the doors open. Will notes used
SYRINGES on the table, filled body bags lined up on the
floor.
It's a creepy, horrible scene.
FRANKLIN
They're all gone.
WILL
I'm sorry, Franklin. Genuinely
sorry...
What's he got to do to get the hell out of there?
Franklin ignores him, steps inside Bright Eyes' cage. He
moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket.
At first Will doesn't understand what he's looking at. The
lighting's dim and the thing's so small...
But then IT MOVES AND WILL REALIZES HE'S LOOKING AT AN INFANT
CHIMPANZEE.
Will stares at it for a long moment, his brain overloaded.
WILL (CONT'D)
It's impossible. How could a full-
term gestation go unnoticed?
FRANKLIN
They carry small. Must have been
pregnant when they brought her in.
Will tries to get his mind around the situation.
17.
WILL
Who else knows about this?
FRANKLIN
No one.
(BEAT)
I'd bring him home, but my brother-
in-law works for security. He'd
rat me out in a second.
That's when will realizes.
WILL
You want me to take him?
FRANKLIN
He's an orphan now.
WILL
I could be thrown in jail. He's a
chimpanzee who's been exposed to a
possibly dangerous drug.
FRANKLIN
You don't believe that.
WILL
Doesn't matter what I believe.
FRANKLIN
Just for a couple days. Until I
can find a sanctuary.
WILL
That's not possible.
FRANKLIN
I heard you outside, fighting to
keep them alive.
WILL
I was talking about the work, my
RESEARCH -
FRANKLIN
she was just trying to protect him.
WILL
What?
0
18.
FRANKLIN
Bright Eyes - the mother. That's
why she wouldn't let anyone into
her cage.
Will looks down at the helpless baby.
WILL
I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry -
but there's nothing I can do here.
He's got to be put down like the
others.
FRANKLIN
Tell you what, Doc.
(producing a syringe)
I'm done for the day. So you be my
guest.
Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will.
It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He
enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his
little hands.
Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's
belly... but there's no way he can go through with this.
Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who
watches from outside the cage.
WILL
Two days. Then you have to figure
it out.
A BOX OF DIAPERS pulled from the shelf and tossed into a
cart.
Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered
in a blanket - plastered to his chest.
He stops at the powdered formulas, overwhelmed by the array
of choices.
A TEEN rings up the baby goods.
TEEN CASHIER
Hey man. Congratulations.
19.
WILL
Huh?
(REALIZING)
Oh. Thanks.
Will dumps the baby goods on the counter, heads for the
refrigerator. The infant's still plastered to his chest.
He opens the fridge, grabs a crisper drawer, empties its
contents in the sink.
Then Will REACHES INTO HIS JACKET POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE
VIAL OF 112. CAREFULLY HE PLACES IT INTO THE DRAWER AND
ROLLS THE DRAWER BACK IN THE FRIDGE.
Will sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion. A HIGH PITCHED
WAIL comes from another part of the house.
Will sits up, remembering.
Will enters, half asleep, turns on the light. The baby chimp
lies in a cardboard box on the floor and he's obviously sick,
making UNNATURAL WHEEZING NOISES.
0
20.
Will stares down at the little creature, trying to decide
what to do.
Will turns on the HOT WATER. SHUTS the door. Holding the
limp, feeble chimp in his arms, he puts down the toilet seat
and sits.
WILL
It's okay. It's going to be okay.
Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit.
Will looks down at the chimp, struggling for breath. The
room fills with STEAM.
CUT TO:
A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD. He stands at the top of
a tree, an alpha male, eyeing the CHIMPS around him.
In a sudden BURST of movement, the CHIMPANZEE TAKES OFF,
FLYING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH with tremendous force, a FREIGHT
TRAIN OF THREAT, POWER AND VIOLENCE.
Teeth bared in a terrifying display, the ape easily
intimidates all the chimps around him.
REVEAL THAT THE CHIMP IMAGES ARE YOU-TUBE AND WILL'S WATCHING
THEM ON HIS LAPTOP.
Abruptly he closes it. Looks down at the infant, so peaceful
in his arms.
SUPER: "TWO YEARS LATER"
SOUND of a TOILET FLUSH.
The chimp - looking like a toddler - walks out of the
bathroom, hiking up a pair of shorts. WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH
THE HOUSE as he zig zags up and over furniture.
The house looks warmer, cluttered, more lived-in.
The chimp arrives at a hallway, where he leaps into the air
and grabs hold of a CORD that hangs from the ceiling.
As his weight pulls it down, there's a SQUEAK and a FOLD DOWN
LADDER opens from above. WE FOLLOW HIM up the ladder into...
21.
.the attic. Beams of light streaming through a LARGE VENT
TO THE OUTSIDE. Rings and pegs for climbing are set into the
walls. Toys, books and puzzles scattered across the floor.
SOUNDS of KIDS PLAYING and LAUGHING OUTSIDE.
The chimp heads for the vent and peers through. WE GO OVER
HIS SHOULDER TO SEE...
Will comes away from the ladder, heads for the kitchen.
The living room floor is strewn with puzzles and games. One
of them has been completed. Will considers it, looks around
for the box, reads the side...
AGES 12 and up. 12 and up.
Caesar runs past, jumps onto d chair at the kitchen table,
picks up a fork and starts eating his eggs and potatoes.
Will walks over, sits across from him.

22.
WILL
Please pass the ketchup.
Caesar slides the ketchup to Will.
WILL (CONT'D)
Thanks.
CAESAR
(using American Sign
LANGUAGE)
You're welcome.
NOTE: Whenever Caesar communicates he's signing and there
will be subtitles.
A MOUSE moves through a maze as a LAB TECH marks its
progress. Will - in a lab coat - watches with intensity.
The mouse moves effortlessly through the maze until it
reaches an ORANGE CONE at a crossroads. The mouse stops,
studies the cone.
LAB TECH
Is he going to turn left or
right...?
The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a
piece of cheese. Will does his best to hide the excitement
blooming on his face.
WILL
There it is. Restored cognitive
function.
LAB TECH
Same success rate as the primates.
Congratulations.
Dr. Molly Stewart - late 20's, pretty tomboy -- finishes
taking Caesar's blood pressure.
23.
 STEWART
He's right on target. Height.
Weight...
She checks Caesar's ears.
CAESAR
Dairy Queen.
WILL
After. Sit still.
STEWART
What about diet?
WILL
A healthy diet. Fruits,
vegetables.
CAESAR
Ice cream.
Will ignores him.
STEWART
What's he saying?
WILL
He's hungry.
Caesar's angling to climb off the examining table. Will
sends him a look - out it out.
STEWART
He seems extremely intelligent.
How many words does Caesar sign?
Beat.
WILL
You know, the basics.
CAESAR
Soft-serve.
STEWART
I've heard of apes learning up to a
hundred and fifty words. Is he
good with puzzles?
Will hesitates.
0
24.
WILL
He's pretty good.
STEWART
Well, Caesar's healthy, obviously
happy. You're doing a great job
with him.
(doesn't want to alarm)
But there is an anomaly I noticed.
WILL
Like what?
STEWART
When I was examining his eyes, I
noticed a strange green
pigmentation.
WILL
Green?
His heart starts to pound.
STEWART
Green. Never.seen it before.
She hands Will an OTOSCOPE.
STEWART (CONT'D)
Take a look.
Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough, finds
FLECKS OF BRIGHT GREEN PIGMENTATION - JUST LIKE THE 112.
STEWART (CONT'D)
It's faint, can you pick it up?
He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned. She eyes him.
STEWART (CONT'D)
You alright? Want a glass of
water?
WILL
No thanks.
(EMBARRASSED)
Sure, that would be good.
She gets him one. Concerned, Caesar comes over.
WILL (CONT'D)
Forgot to eat today. Not a big
deal.
25.
Stewart hands him the glass. He downs it.
WILL (CONT'D)
(TO CAESAR)
I'm fine.
Stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck. Feels good.
STEWART
Carotid pulse is running a little
fast.
WILL
For a human or a chimpanzee?
First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face.
STEWART
Gotta remember to eat.
Will drives Caesar, both of them licking soft-serve ice cream
cones. He pulls up outside a store: "SMART CHILD"
EDUCATIONAL TESTING TOYS.
WILL (O.S.)
You have to move the whole tower to
another peg, one block at a time.
Walter's parked in front of the TV, not watching it.
Caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three
wooden poles. There are four colored blocks threaded on the
first pole, stacked biggest to smallest, making a 'tower'.
Irena stands next to Will, watching Caesar. There's also a
CAMCORDER on a tripod.
WILL
Here's the hard part: you can't put
a larger block on top of a smaller
one.
Caesar studies the puzzle.
WILL (CONT'D)
Understand?
26.
Caesar's already started. He methodically begins moving
blocks from one pole to another, pausing, backtracking,
getting it right, never a bigger one on top of a smaller...
Will watches, increasingly amazed, as he re-creates the tower
on a different pole. It's easy for him.
Finished, Caesar looks up at him. Will fumbles in his
pocket, HANDS CAESAR SOME M&MS.;
WILL (CONT'D)
(STUNNED)
He did it in fifteen moves.
IRENA
What's the best score?
WILL
Fifteen.
Will looks over at Walter, who's staring at the wall.
IRENA
(AMAZED)
I wonder where he gets such talent?
WILL
(eyes on Walter)
It was passed down from his mother.
Will uploads the MPEG video of Caesar doing the puzzle and
prepares to record an AUDIO ATTACHMENT.
WILL
(into computer mic)
At age two Caesar appears to exceed
his mother's aptitude. He signs
over three hundred words. He
exhibits no visible side effects
from the therapy...
Will flips on a light. Enters. Closes the door behind him.
Taking a key from his pocket he approaches a SMALL, PADLOCKED
REFRIGERATOR and unlocks it. Opens the door.
Inside-WE SEE: THE SINGLE VIAL OF ADV 112.
27.
Will sits on the edge of the sofa, the VIAL of 112 in his
hand. He's deep in agonized thought.
Finally he takes a SYRINGE and FILLS IT WITH THE GREEN
LIQUID. Then he stands, walks to a closed door.
The opening door sends a wash of light into the dark room.
Walter's in bed. He opens his eyes, squinting at the
brightness.
WILL
(syringe in hand)
Dad. I've got something that's
going to make you better.
Will closes the door behind him. WE HEAR A RHYTHMIC
SQUEAKING NOISE as we...
CUT TO:
Will's making sandwiches, his eye on Caesar through the
window.
WILL
(to someone offscreen)
You want turkey or ham?
28.
VOICE (O.S.)
Ham!
WE FIND WALTER just sitting down on the piano bench. He
begins playing a competent version of "CLAIR DE LUNE."
Will pauses, listening to the MUSIC. He moves to the doorway
to watch his father.
The happiness - the relief - is clear on his face.
Will returns to his sandwich making. It takes him a moment
to notice that CAESAR HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SWING.
The color drains from his face.
Todd and his buddy throw the ball over Caesar's head, while
Caesar jumps to try and catch it.
TODD AND FRIEND
Monkey in the middle, monkey in the
middle...
Caesar's having fun, unaware that the game has become keep-
away from him. Until he NOTICES ALICE'S EXPRESSION - SHE
FEELS SORRY FOR HIM.
THEN, IN A STOMACH-LURCHING MOMENT CAESAR REALIZES WHAT'S
GOING ON: HE'S THE BUTT OF A JOKE.
They're making fun of him.
"MONKEY", "MONKEY", "MONKEY"... The chanted words ring in
Caesar's ears. He drops his arms and walks over to Todd,
stepping close, hot rage escaping from his nostrils.
Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face.
Alice runs inside.
STEWART
What does he do for fun?
Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little
thrown by the question.
WILL
Well we've got puzzles, games, a
swing set...
STEWART
My guess is he needs more. More
exercise, more space.
WILL
We'll work on that.
Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen
to his heart. Closing her eyes for a moment, listening.
31.
He gets up his nerve.
WILL (CONT'D)
What about you?
(BEAT)
What do you do for fun?
She opens her eyes, looks at him. He thinks she doesn't
understand the question.
WILL (CONT'D)
How about dinner and a movie?
Stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears.
STEWART
I'm sorry, did you say something?
He starts to try again - but the moment's gone.
WILL
No - nothing.
Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed.
Stewart lingers a moment, certain she's missed something -
but Will doesn't say more.
Caesar - driving with Walter and Will -- looks out the window,
extremely excited.
Will leads Caesar inside the examination room - and finds
himself face to face with a YOUNG MALE VETERINARIAN.
WILL
Where's Dr. Stewart?
S VETERINARIAN
She doesn't work here anymore.
34.
Doesn't work here anymore?
WILL
Do you know where she went?
VETERINARIAN
I'm sorry - I don't.
Will's deeply disappointed.
Caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood TEENAGERS
walk home from school.
One BOY walks with a blonde teenage GIRL, books clutched to
her chest. Caesar watches the Boy flirt with her. The girl
smiles, flirts back.
One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head.
The BOY SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER and returns to the girl.
Caesar's fascinated by these antics. He wants to be with
these teens. He wants to be one of them.
35.
Caesar stands in front of a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, shirtless.
He stands up straight, like a human. Tries to imitate their
posture, their gait.
BUT FROM THE MIRROR A CHIMPANZEE STARES BACK AT HIM. A
CHIMPANZEE WITH GREEN EYES.
THERE'S A PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ON HIS SHOULDER - JUST
LIKE ALPHA'S.
He runs two fingers down the length of it.
Caesar, Walter and Will sit at the dinner table. There's
tension here, but we can't place it yet.
Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S
USING THE WRONG END OF THE SPOON. He clutches the utensil,
staring at it.
WILL
Turn it around, Dad. You're using
the wrong end.
Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending.
With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the
old man, adjusting the spoon.
Will watches. Heartbroken.
A MOUSE runs through a MAZE. It reaches a fork in the path,
leading to two different plastic objects, one green, one
orange. The mouse hesitates, confused.
He backs away from the cone.
A LAB TECH makes a note. Will and Jacobs stand behind him,
reading the number results on a monitor.
Will's obviously discouraged.
WILL
The drug's not staying ahead of the
disease.
0
36.
JACOBS
But we're still making progress,
right?
Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written
all over his face.
WILL
Sure. At this pace we'll get to
trials by the time Hell freezes
over.
Jacobs - embarrassed in front of the Tech - pulls him aside.
JACOBS
This isn't graduate school -
there's a procedure we have to
adhere to.
WILL
It'll take forever. I need to
start developing a primate version
now.
Jacobs looks at Will. He's known him a long time.
JACOBS
How's your father? Haven't seen
him in a while.
WILL
This isn't about him.
JACOBS
He's worse, isn't he?
Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell
him about Caesar, about Walter's treatment - but he can't.
WILL
(EVASIVE)
He's fine.
WE HEAR A PERSISTENT C SHARP COMING FROM A DISTANT PIANO.
It's a familiar, baleful SOUND that continues over the
following...
Will sits in front of the computer, looking at a file crammed
with MPEGs of Caesar doing puzzles and games.
37.
WILL
(into computer mic)
Caesar continues to maintain a high
level of cognition. But Walter's
disease has caught up to the
neurogenesis treatment. Nearly all
initial improvement has been
erased...
Will stops recording. KICKS his desk in frustration.
Walter sits at the piano, hitting his one note.
Caesar passes him, heads for Will's study.
Caesar enters, finds Will at the desk, head in hands. Will
senses his presence. Looks up.
CAESAR
Who Caesar.
WILL
What do you mean?
CAESAR
Who.
With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and
tries to understand what Caesar wants from him.
CAESAR (CONT'D)
Who.
WILL
Caesar is an ape.
(SIGNING)
A chimpanzee.
CAESAR
No "what". "Who".
Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual
leap Caesar's taken.
WILL
Are you asking about your identity?
That's abstract thought, Caesar.
Caesar couldn't care less about 'abstract thought.'
38.
CAESAR
Walter Will father. Will Caesar
father?
Will looks at the chimp - sees the intensity, the pain on his
face. How to begin to answer?
WILL (O.S.)
This is where you were born. It's
the place where I work.
Will and Caesar are PARKED ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE GEN-SYS
LAB GROUNDS, its buildings visible through the fencing.
WILL
I never knew your father, but your
mother came to live here. This is
where you were born.
CAESAR
Caesar mother?
WILL
She was very very smart. And she
passed that onto you through her
blood.
Caesar strains for a better view. Undoes his seatbelt.
CAESAR
Caesar go. Caesar see.
Will locks the car door.
WILL
She's not here anymore. I'm sorry,
Caesar - she died. That's when I
brought you home to live with me
and Walter.
Caesar's getting worked up - he wants out of the car.
CAESAR
Caesar mother...
Will grows concerned.
WILL
No. This is a bad place for you,
Caesar. We're going to go now.
39.
As Will pulls away Caesar strains for a last glimpse,
twisting around to look out the back window.
VOICE (O.S.)
Let's see if we can find something
for you on the TV...
Walter has a new HOME AIDE - a pale, hard-looking older
woman. He sits on the sofa staring at the TV's moving images
as she changes channels.
The Aide settles on a news show covering preparations for a
SPACE LAUNCH. ASTRONAUTS wave to the PRESS CORPS as they
board a SHUTTLE.
TV REPORTER
The Icarus crew is led by Commander
Colonel George Taylor. This is his
fifth space mission...
CLOSE ON a crude drawing of an ape. Caesar sits on the
floor, working on its details. As he draws the white
birthmark - like a falling star - WE REALIZE it's a self-
portrait.
TV's still blaring, but the sofa's empty.
REVEAL Walter, standing in the middle of the room, confused.
As if he's not sure where he is.
Abruptly he turns and heads across the room... and OUT THE
FRONT DOOR.
Hearing the CRASH, Caesar jumps to his feet, rushes to the
vent. He sees Hunsiker emerge from the smashed car, unhurt.
Caesar watches as Hunsiker inspects the ruined front fender,
then turns to YELL at someone.
That's when Walter comes into Caesar's view.
He's in the street, afraid, disoriented - while Hunsiker
rages, jabbing a threatening finger towards Walter's chest.
In a flash Caesar's down the attic stairs.
Jacobs watches the evening NEWS.
REPORTER
The defense claimed the chimp was
merely trying to protect its owner
from perceived aggression.
FOOTAGE OF WILL LEAVING A COURTHOUSE, avoiding News Crews.
Jacobs sits forward, turns up the volume.
REPORTER (CONT'D)
The chimpanzee's distraught owner,
Wilson Rodman, has raised the
animal since he was an infant.
(MORE)
43.
REPORTER (CONT'D)
He pleaded to keep Caesar at home,
citing the ape's remarkable
intelligence.
Will and a chimpanzee? Jacobs stares at the TV, dumbfounded.
Will and Caesar drive. Caesar's dressed up - khaki pants and
a Polo shirt.
WILL
We're visiting a place called "The
Ranch". They have animals.
CAESAR
Real animals?
WILL
You bet. Apes. Chimpanzees,
gorillas, orangutans...
Caesar GRUNTS, excited.
WILL (CONT'D)
It'll be good. You'll like it very
much.
Caesar looks at Will, picking up on something.
CAESAR
Will sad?
WILL
What? No, I'm fine.
They pull into a CLEARING. Ahead is a new world - CONCRETE
AND STEEL BUILDINGS set incongruously into the bucolic
countryside.
A HOUSE/OFFICE, a LIVING QUARTERS, a HORSE PADDOCK - all
cold, efficient structures.
CAESAR
Where animals?
44.
Will sees the PRIMATE CAGES in the distance, next to a GIANT
RED METAL ATRIUM.
WILL
Inside, I think...
.the Chimpanzee House - and stops in his tracks.
This is the source of the APE NOISE. It has an open, indoor
area in the center, bordered by cages of CHIMPANZEES.
Caesar's TAKEN ABACK BY THE LOUD, DARK FORMS POUNDING AROUND
THEIR CAGES.
DODGE
Caesar - over here.
Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for
salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE
REALIZES IT'S A DEAD END.
He turns, but DODGE SHUTS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE AND LOCKS IT.
CAESAR FINDS HIMSELF TRAPPED IN A 10' BY 10' CAGE.
DODGE (CONT'D)
Stupid monkey.
FOR A MOMENT CAESAR'S IN SHOCK, HIS MIND UNABLE TO PROCESS
THE BETRAYAL.
Then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars, jumping to
the ceiling, searching for a way out.
To his left: the faces of THREE HUGE, AGITATED CHIMPANZEES
pound the concrete floor, YELLING at him. To his right:
THREE MORE CHIMPANZEES.
Caesar lets out a PRIMAL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. WE FOLLOW
THE SCREAM as it spreads out over the property...
Will keeps driving, TEARS streaming down his face.
0
48.
Time has passed. Long shadows of late afternoon.
Caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the
cage, heavy head resting on his arms.
He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE,
followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up.
In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR
CHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD
ACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN.
This is ROCKET.
He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage
floor... then SLAMS IT AGAINST THE WALL.
He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a
challenging eye to Caesar.
SCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM!
A terrifying display of power and dominance.
DODGE (O.S.)
Okay, assholes. Dinner time.
Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening
look to Caesar - moves off.
Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out.
Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to
cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in
an occasional rotted vegetable.
The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels
food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet-
looking dog food.
DODGE (CONT'D)
Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow.
Bet you don't get none of that in
the suburbs.
Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL
IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney
looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too.
49.
DODGE (CONT'D)
Think that's funny? That funny to
you, you hairy prick?
Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER.
RODNEY
Look at that!
Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage.
DODGE
One thing you can count on: Long as
there are humans on this earth,
you'll always be a monkey in a
cage.
The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards.
Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his
back as a shield.
The water BLAST is relentless.
Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a
long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the
floor.
RODNEY
What about his clothes? Might
cause problems with the other apes.
DODGE
Leave 'em.
Will looks terrible. He's unshaven, pale, drawn. He sits on
the sofa, surrounded by reminders of Caesar - puzzles, games,
etc. The newspaper's unread beside him.
WALTER (O.S.)
John?
Walter enters, looks at Will.
9
50.
WALTER (CONT'D)
John - where's Caesar?
The old man looks stricken.
WALTER (CONT'D)
Shouldn't we look for him? Isn't
there something we can do?
Will looks up at his father. He's just had an idea.
WE FOLLOW Will as he strides purposefully into the cafeteria.
He's shaved, pulled himself together.
Will spots Jacobs,'lunching with his Blackberry, in a corner.
He heads for him. Jacobs looks up, sees will coming.
Will slides into the seat across from him.
JACOBS
You've been gone a week.
WILL
I was sick.
JACOBS
Too sick to return my calls? You
know it was a funny thing, but I
was watching the news and they
started talking about a seven-year-
old chimpanzee that went nuts - and
all of a sudden, there you were on
the TV. A seven year old chimp,
raised since birth.
The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his
voice. Neither man cares.
WILL
He's the son of chimp 4. And he's
smart. Off-the-charts smart.
Because of the 112. The genetic
therapy was passed in utero - from
the mother to the son. Without a
single negative side-effect.
JACOBS
Aside from biting off a man's
finger.
51.
WILL
He was protecting my father. The
same way his mother was protecting
him.
JACOBS
We've had this conversation
already. We knew the 112 was
making the apes smart -
WILL
(INTERRUPTING)
I tried the 112 on my father.
A conversation stopper. Jacobs is stunned. That's the
effect Will was after.
WILL (CONT'D)
I had a sample vial.
JACOBS
You're out of your mind.
Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit
there. And Jacobs is undeniably, voraciously curious.
WILL
Don't you want to know if it
worked?
Jacobs can't resist...
JACOBS
Did it?
WILL
It was miraculous. Unquestionable
adult neurogenesis - development of
fresh nerve tissue.
(BEAT)
It brought my father back.
But Jacobs is confused.
JACOBS
You told me he was failing.
WILL
It's just like with the mice.
Alzheimer's is a progressive
disease, you need to keep it at bay
 - you need boosters.
52.
Will can see Jacobs turning this over in his mind - the
possibilities. The money.
JACOBS
Why have you waited so long to tell
me this?
WILL
I couldn't risk losing him.
JACOBS
'Him'?
WILL
Caesar.
JACOBS
The ape?
Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity.
WILL
We've discovered a safe treatment.
It's the payday you've been waiting
for. I'll recreate the primate
version of 112 for you.
(BEAT)
But only under one condition.
It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged.
JACOBS
You're giving me conditions? I
could have you arrested for what
you've done.
WILL
But you won't - you need me to
build the drug. Here's what I
need: I want you to get Caesar
back.
JACOBS
(THROWN)
How the hell can I do that?
WILL
However they do things in your part
of the world. Get attorneys into
it. Write checks. Slip cash into
the right pockets.
(pausing for emphasis)
Make it happen.
53.
Early morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar's cage.
He wakes shivering with cold. Notices that the other cages
are empty - that his cage door is open.
Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area.
Caesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet
floor, along with the detritus of feeding time.
He can HEAR the APES in the distance.
Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He
pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE.
Caesar lies on a medical table, NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED.
His shirt's ripped, and he's still wearing the khaki pants,
now filthy and torn. TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST,
PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE.
It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment.
Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing,
restrained to a medical table.
Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings.
VOICE
Caesar.
Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head.
STEWART
Do you remember me? I'm Dr.
Stewart.
She hands him a cup of water with a straw.
STEWART (CONT'D)
Drink.
Caesar doesn't want the water. He signs. She clearly
doesn't understand. He signs again.
STEWART (CONT'D)
I don't understand.
Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW
SOUND. She's taken aback - is he trying to speak?
STEWART (CONT-D)
Can you show me? Show me what you
need.
Caesar pulls at the restraints.
STEWART (CONT'D)
I can't take those off.
Caesar sags with defeat, overcome with DESPAIR.
0
56.
STEWART (CONT'D)
I'm sorry this has happened,
Caesar. So sorry.
Stewart stares at him. Moved at the complexity of his
emotion, the obvious intelligence behind his pain.
STEWART (CONT'D)
I'm here once a week. I'll do my
best to look after you.
A spinning machine, test tubes, a giant propagation tank.
Empty canisters labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
REVEAL WILL in the doorway, watching it all very carefully.
A VIRUS TECHNICIAN approaches him. He's tentative, nervous.
VIRUS TECHNICIAN
Dr. Rodman - I think there's been a
mistake.
Will's been waiting for this observation - he's surprised it
took so long to come up.
VIRUS TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)
I've double-checked the replication
rate of the 113 - and it's
enormously fast compared to the
112.
WILL
That's why we're using it. We need
the drug quickly.
VIRUS TECHNICIAN
But... isn't it risky? I mean, at
this rate of propagation, we
greatly increase the possibility of
mutations that are out of our
control. It's a highly unstable -
WILL
I appreciate your concern - but
it's going to be fine. We plan on
taking precautions.
The Technician pauses, not entirely satisfied. But Will's
look tells him the conversation is over.
58.
BEEP BEEP BEEP...
Will's in his sweats, working. DOORBELL.
They stand awkwardly by the door. She looks great.
WILL
Can I - you want a cup of coffee or
something?
STEWART
No - thanks. I just wanted to let
you know that I've seen Caesar.
Seen Caesar?
WILL
How?
STEWART
I volunteer once a week at The
Ranch.
WILL
Is he alright?
She hesitates, wanting to be honest but not alarming.
59.
STEWART
Yeah. He had a rough start, but
things should get smoother from now
on...
In the other room, Walter and his Aide become visible. Will
follows Stewart's curious gaze.
WILL
That's my dad. He's not doing too
well.
STEWART
Oh. Sorry.
(BEAT)
Anyway, Caesar's going to be okay.
I'm looking after him.
WILL
Thank you... I appreciate that.
Awkward beat.
STEWART
Well. If you give me your number
I'll let you know from time to time
how things are going -
WILL
Let's grab a drink.
Takes her by surprise. Maybe takes him by surprise too.
She's happy he asked.
STEWART
Love to.
A repulsive bowl of primate chow. Caesar - bandaged, beat-up
and miserable - picks at it. In the next cage, the
orangutans sleep.
ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. Dodge and Rodney drive up in a truck,
windows down, radio blaring. Dodge gets out, cigarette in
his mouth, and moves drunkenly to the storage shed.
40 He emerges with two BEERS, throws one to Rodney.
60.
Caesar watches as Dodge offers a beer can to a chimpanzee.
DODGE
Want a beer?
The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away.
DODGE (CONT'D)
Here's a little taste of beer...
He unzips his fly and PISSES INTO THE CHIMP'S FEEDING TROUGH.
Caesar watches, disgusted.
A LEVER THROWN OPEN.
Caesar watches as Dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages
in succession.
Rodney moves to the orangutan house. CAESAR PAYS CLOSE
ATTENTION TO THE LOCK AS IT SLIDES OPEN.
DODGE & RODNEY
Move it! Let's go!
Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing
ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move
across the bridge.
On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE,
ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out,
then moves off to join the others.
Caesar maneuvers to get a better view.
Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him
push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his
arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS
HAND, PALM DOWN, OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE.
Rocket's the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE.
Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA, Buck - still
alone in his cage, staring through the bars, miserable.
Why doesn't the gorilla ever get to go out?
Then something across the ranch catches Caesar's eye: WILL'S
CAR'S DRIVING UP TO THE OFFICE.
61.
His heart skips a beat. He moves to the bars, barely able to
contain his excitement.
The door slides open. Stewart enters, followed by Dodge.
STEWART
How's your arm? Mind if I take a
look?
Stewart rummages in her MEDICAL BAG. CAESAR WATCHES AS SHE
PULLS OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS, cuts off his bandages.
STEWART (CONT'D)
Looking good...
Caesar makes eye contact with Dodge over Stewart's shoulder.
She pulls a harness from her bag.
STEWART (CONT'D)
I'm taking him out. Thought I'd
cheer him up, show him the horses.
DODGE
No way.
As she walks to Dodge, CAESAR GLANCES INTO HER MEDICAL BAG.
STEWART
What are you going to do? Use a
cattle prod on me?
DODGE
If you're into that kind of thing.
STEWART
I'm safer with him than I am with
you.
DODGE
Answer's no.
64.
Stewart turns to Caesar, who's retreated onto a bed of straw.
STEWART
I can't take you.
(glancing at Dodge)
Maybe another time.
RAIN. The apes sleep. Except for Caesar.
Standing in the corner of his cage, Caesar pulls STEWART'S
SCISSORS and a roll of MEDICAL TAPE out from the STRAW.
He kneels at his bedding, gathering sticks and straw. Then
he begins weaving the tape through several sticks, binding
them and extending them end to end.
Caesar pauses, sensing something. He looks over his
shoulder, discovers MAURICE THE ORANGUTAN watching him.
They hold each others' gaze, Caesar taking his measure. Then
Caesar puts a finger to his lips. "Shhhh."
Maurice makes no movement, but the agreement is clear.
Caesar returns to crafting the tool.
Dark FORMS in cages, illuminated by GREEN FLUORESCENT LIGHT.
The DOOR OPENS. EYES OPEN, HEADS TURN.
Will enters - WE SEE THAT HIS HAND HIS BANDAGED.
The apes watch as he walks along the cages, eyes searching
the dark chimpanzee faces.
EACH LAB CHIMP HAS A DIFFERENT COLORED IDENTIFICATION WRIST
BAND.
WILL
Which one of you wants chocolate...
Chimpanzees stare back at him, giving him nothing.
NOISE FROM BEHIND. Will turns. Down the row, A CHIMPANZEE
ARM EXTENDS FROM A CAGE, PALM UP - WITH A RED BAND.
Will walks to the cage, chimp #11, reads the label beside it.
WILL (CONT'D)
"Koba."
65.
He peers inside. Koba stares back, EYES MURKY AND SMALL
BENEATH A HEAVILY PROTRUDING BROW, DARKENED PIGMENTATION
STREAKS DOWN EACH CHEEK. A SINISTER FACE.
He DROPS AN M&M; INTO KOBA'S PALM. Eyes on Will, Koba secrets
it to a "storage spot" inside the cage.
Then he puts out his hand again.
VOICE (O.S.)
Nanotherapy, beta version: Male
Test Subject Number eleven.
Koba doesn't resist as Will straps him to the table.
He watches as a HANDLER -- EVANS - moves into the next room,
opens a refrigerator with a strange BIOHAZARD SYMBOL and
pulls out CANISTER labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
Evans and Will each slip on HAZMAT masks, making sure they're
secure. Then Evans hands the 113 to Will.
All of this avidly taken in by Koba's dark eyes.
Will inserts the adenovirus 113 nozzle into a plastic oxygen
mask.
Koba's eyes are on him as he brings the mask toward the
chimp's face.
EVANS
(THROUGH MASK)
Boy, he's a calm one, isn't he?
Will tilts the nozzle, releasing a BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST INTO
KOBA'S NOSE AND MOUTH.
THE CHIMPANZEE CONVULSES ON THE TABLE.
CHOP STICKS digging into take-out Chinese. Stewart and Will
sit in her kitchen, eating. It's clear from their state of
dress (or undress) that they've been intimate.
Because his hand is still bandaged, he's having a hard time
with the chopsticks.
STEWART
You actually punched him?
66.
WILL
I did.
She thinks it's funny.
STEWART
I've been wanting to do that since
the day I met him.
WILL
I don't advise it. My hand's
killing me.
STEWART
Here. Let me help you out.
She begins feeding him the Chinese food. He puts down his
chopsticks.
WILL
I'm going to get him out of there.
STEWART
I know you are.
WILL
And I'm going to get my dad back
too.
Caesar tapes sticks together. WE SEE that he's created a
THREE-FOOT LONG "ARM". He tapes the scissors firmly to its
end, finger holes sticking out. Finished.
Silently he moves to the edge of the cage. USING THE
CONTRAPTION, HE LOOPS THE FINGER HOLES OVER THE LATCH.
He tries once. Misses. Twice. Misses again. Caesar keeps
trying... until finally the loop's in place.
Then he begins to tug. Tug. Tug. CLICK - the LATCH OPENS.
He glances over to Maurice, who silently watches.
Caesar pushes open the cage door. MAURICE'S EYES FOLLOW HIM
INTO THE NIGHT.
.enters the cage, edging up to the sleeping gorilla.
From this vantage point, Buck looks enormous, his vast chest
rising and falling with sleep. Caesar very carefully wiggles
his toe.
There's a GRUNT and a WHIRL OF BLACK FURRY MOVEMENT. Caesar
finds himself staring into the huge, angry gorilla face.
Caesar - nervous - beckons toward the open door.
Buck understands but can't believe it. For a moment he
doesn't move. Caesar makes the gesture again -- "Come on,
let's go."
Before he can finish, Buck bursts past him...
Caesar senses something: Maurice is staring at him. Caesar 's
beginning to wonder what Maurice wants when the ORANGUTAN
DOES SOMETHING REMARKABLE: HE USES SIGN LANGUAGE.
MAURICE
Happy gorilla.
Caesar's shocked.
MAURICE (CONT'D)
Surprise.
CAESAR
Signing orangutan.
MAURICE
Maurice circus orangutan.
CAESAR
More ape sign?
MAURICE
No. Maurice alone.
They HEAR DODGE'S WHEELBARROW APPROACH.
CAESAR
Careful. Stupid human no like
smart ape.
Dodge begins shoveling primate chow into the troughs.
Maurice and Caesar stop signing and blend in.
Rocket sleeps. Pieces of primate chow hit him in the head.
He wakes with a start. SEES THAT HIS CAGE DOOR IS OPEN.
69.
Rocket gets to his feet, sees CAESAR STANDING IN THE COMMON
AREA.
Rocket GRUNTS and sprints after him - through the chimpanzee
common area - toward the door -
Where WHAM! CAESAR WHACKS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH ROCKET'S
PLASTIC REFRIGERATOR.
ROCKET STAGGERS, TRYING TO RECOVER, AND LANDS ON HIS BUTT.
HE LOOKS UP TO SEE CAESAR... AND BEHIND HIM, STANDING LIKE A
MOUNTAIN: BUCK.
Buck raises his arms and SLAMS them down with a MIGHTY ROAR;
Caesar slings the plastic refrigerator aside, sending it
SKITTERING across the CONCRETE.
The chimpanzees, awake now, watch to see what will happen.
Rocket looks from Buck to Caesar. He's beaten.
STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND, PALM UP, ROCKET MAKES THE
SUPPLICATING GESTURE. CAESAR RUNS HIS HAND - PALM DOWN -
OVER ROCKET'S, SEALING HIS DOMINATION.
A COLLECTIVE GASP OF AWE moves through the ho-use.
Rocket crawls back to his cage, defeated. Caesar - walking
at full height - follows. He CLOSES ROCKET'S CAGE DOOR AND
LOCKS HIM IN.
Then Caesar walks upright around the cages once more, making
eye contact with each and every chimpanzee. He exits with
his Lieutenant, Buck, in tow.
CHIMPANZEE HOUSE HAS A NEW ALPHA MALE.
Will and Evans (the handler) are wearing hazmat masks as they
administer Adenovirus 113 to chimp after chimp.
Chimp after chimp convulses on the table.
They lead Koba to the table. Koba knows what to do. He lies
down, allows himself to be strapped in.
All routine. Everyone's guard is down.
But as soon as the BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST is released, KOBA
 THRASHES OUT AN ARM, HITTING EVANS IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.
70.
WILL
Hold him steady!
Evans tightens the straps on Koba's flailing arm.
WE SEE THAT EVANS' MASK HAS BEEN KNOCKED ASKEW.
Will finishes administering the drug. Koba goes limp on the
table.
WILL (CONT'D)
You okay Evans?
EVANS
Yeah. I'm good.
Will demonstrates the "Tower of Hanoi" puzzle. Koba watches.
WILL
You can't put larger blocks on top
of smaller ones.
(pointing to right side)
Move the stack from here to here.
Koba takes the puzzle and ROTATES IT 180 DEGREES CLOCKWISE,
SO THAT THE LEFT STACK IS INDEED NOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
Will looks at Koba. Koba looks back.
WILL (CONT'D)
(DEMONSTRATING)
You've got to take the blocks off
and stack them again, like this.
Will turns the puzzle back around.
WILL (CONT'D)
Let's see you try.
Koba puts out a palm - asking for an M&M.;
WILL (CONT'D)
I'll give you an M&M; if you can get
the blocks to the other side - but
don't do it the way you did last
time.
Koba thinks, then ROTATES THE PUZZLE AGAIN - THIS TIME
COUNTERCLOCKWISE. Ingenious in its own way.
71.
WILL (CONT'D)
You know what I want. You're just
not going to give it to me.
Koba puts out a palm. There's A LOOK IN HIS EYE, MALEVOLENT,
DISQUIETING.
AND SOMETHING ELSE: HIS EYES HAVE CHANGED. THEY LOOK
SOMEWHAT LIKE CAESAR'S - GREENER, LESS SIMIAN...
WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
What do you think of Koba?
We look through cage bars at Will and Franklin, who stand far
away, across the room.
FRANKLIN
You wanna know if I think the 113's
making him nuts.
WILL
I know he's smart. But there's
something else, something
worrisome. He challenges me.
Taunts me.
Will looks toward us, toward the bars.
WILL (CONT'D)
(almost to himself)
I don't want to try it on...
(CATCHES HIMSELF)
.I don't want to start human
trials if there's any chance of
danger.
FRANKLIN
What you're seeing has nothing to
do with the 113, Doc. The apes're
just like us - they're complex.
Some are loyal, some are selfish,
some have a good sense of humor.
And some are born rotten.
Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of
view, from inside the cage.
Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his
 face frame the two men across the room.
72.
FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
This one's a bad apple, that's all.
A chill runs down Will's spine.
ROCKET'S MISERABLE. Dodge and Rodney watch him through the
bars.
RODNEY
Still won't eat, won't come out.
DODGE
I can fix that.
Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage.
73.
DODGE (CONT'D)
Get that monkey ass out of there!
Caesar watches Dodge BLAST Rocket with WATER. Rocket doesn't
struggle, doesn't fight back. The harsh jet pelts his back.
Rocket sleeps. The FEEDER BIN OPENS AND SHUTS, waking him.
Tentatively, Rocket peers inside the bin: A COOKIE. Never
seen a cookie before. Rocket picks it up. Smells it. Takes
a taste. Wow. He gobbles it down.
At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS.
Caesar stands holding a LARGE BAG OF CHIPS AHOY. He tosses a
cookie to Rocket. Beckons him out of the cage.
Rocket exits warily, on his guard for anything...
But Caesar simply stands with the cookie bag. No gorilla.
No shovel.
He hands the cookie bag to Rocket.
Rocket watches - confused - as CAESAR PULLS THE MAIN LEVER,
OPENING ALL THE CAGES AT ONCE.
CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered.
Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar
makes a motion with his hand.
Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest
chimp. Then another one. Then another.
The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND
ROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE
MOMENT - ROCKET'S FOUND HIS FOOTING.
Now Caesar opens the orangutan and gorilla cages. A moment
of discomfort as Caesar leads the other apes in.
Caesar pulls an orangutan over to Rocket. Rocket hands the
orangutan a cookie. The other orangutans and Buck
immediately line up. Discomfort's gone - now it's one big
 party.
74.
Caesar watches, satisfied, as the apes feast together.
Will's getting ready for his day. Hair wet from the shower,
buttoning up his shirt, he pauses to pour himself a cup of
coffee, look up at the clock.
75.
He takes a sip, heads down the hall to his father's room.
WILL
Someone's sleeping late today -
Will opens the door - and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.
WILL (CONT'D)
Dad?
Will sits with a glass of Scotch, watching TV. Stewart's
looking at a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH.
NEWSCASTER
Captain Taylor and his crew are
navigating the ship around the dark
side of Mars. Communication is
expected to be reestablished -
WILL
I was too late.
She puts the photo down, cuddles against him.
STEWART
You tried. You worked really hard.
Walter knew that.
WILL
Wasn't good enough though, was it.
ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH. It shows a younger Walter and his
two teenage sons...
Franklin's on the phone.
FRANKLIN
Just checking in. You didn't show
up at work today.
CUT TO:
Crummy little place. TV's on with no sound. WE HEAR
FRANKLIN'S VOICE through the phone machine.
FRANKLIN (O.S.)
Hope you're feeling better - let me
know if you need anything.
77.
REVEAL EVANS, LYING IN BED, DEAD - a streak of brown dried
blood across his cheek -- as if draining from his lifeless
eye.
Caesar uses his contraption to get out of the cage. Maurice
grabs his arm.
MAURICE
Where go?
CAESAR
Find Mother.
CLOSE ON WILL'S SLEEPING FACE.
CREAK, CREAK... CREAK, CREAK.
WILL'S WAKENED by the NOISE. What is that?
CREAK, CREAK. . .CREAK, CREAK.
It's coming from outside.
REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will. He gets out of bed,
moves to the window, looks into the back yard.
THE SWING MOVES BACK AND FORTH, AS IF RECENTLY OCCUPIED.
Will scans the grounds - no movement, nothing to see.
Satisfied, he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes.
THAT'S WHEN A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE BED.
It's CAESAR'S SILHOUETTE, noiselessly emerging from the
darkness.
He stands there, looking down at Will and Stewart.
His face is impossible to read.
79.
Rocket's fascinated by photos of Caesar with Will and Walter
along the mantle.
Caesar emerges from Will's room and makes his way down the
hallway.
Stripped bed, a couple of packed boxes. Caesar stands at the
doorway, taking it in.
The Security Guard yawns, checks his watch. Over his
shoulder, on a monitor, WE SEE the dark forms of two
chimpanzees run across the grounds.
Franklin's got the graveyard shift. He's watching a movie on
the office computer - doesn't hear anything.
Eerie, darkly lit. SLEEPING CHIMPS stir. CAESAR and ROCKET
drop to the cement floor.
Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED
FIGURES INSIDE. Caesar walks alongside them, peering into
each one, studying the shadowy, simian faces.
A HAIRY ARM EXTENDS THROUGH THE BARS, PALM UP - IT HAS A RED
BAND AROUND ITS WRIST.
IT'S OFFERING AN M&M.;
Caesar approaches the cage... FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH
KOBA.
HIS EYES ARE BEADY, A STEELY GREY.
THE TWO CHIMPANZEES SIZE EACH OTHER UP. EACH SENSES
SOMETHING IN THE OTHER, BUT NEITHER KNOWS WHAT IT IS.
Caesar moves on. HE'S INTENT, LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.
Rocket barrels forward, grabs the M&M; from Koba's hand.
Koba offers up ANOTHER M&M.; But ROCKET'S EYES ARE ON THE RED
IDENTIFICATION BAND - THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.
KOBA CAN SEE THIS. HE OFFERS IT UP - IN RETURN FOR OPENING
HIS CAGE.
ROCKET CONSIDERS A MOMENT, THEN MOVES TO THE LATCH.
ANGLE ON Caesar.
He's nearly reached the last of the cages, and the
DISAPPOINTMENT IS PLAIN ON HIS FACE.
These chimpanzees are distant, strange. No familiar face.
NO CONNECTION.
Caesar reaches the last cage, where A YOUNG CHIMP, sick,
stares back at him.
Caesar turns away, crestfallen.
81.
He YELLS for ROCKET, and the two of them take off. The LAB
CHIMPS start to SCREAM.
HEARING THE COMMOTION, Franklin puts down his book, heads...
.into the Primate House. Where he stops in his tracks.
KOBA STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, UPRIGHT.
They stare at each other.
Then Koba LEAPS FOR HIM.
Caesar and Rocket enter. That's when WE NOTICE: CAESAR'S
KHAKI PANTS ARE GONE - HE'S NO LONGER DRESSED LIKE A HUMAN.
Caesar opens Rocket's cage. As soon as the door closes
behind him, the huge chimp collapses, exhausted.
Caesar walks around the chimpanzee house, images of the night
swirling through his head. Around him, the chimps sleep,
oblivious.
Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him.
The apes have calmed down. Koba slips back into his cage and
 closes the door.
82.
CLICK. It locks into place.
Sunlight reaches through the bars and streaks across Caesar's
face. He opens his eyes. Looks at Cornelia, still asleep.
Caesar creeps toward the open entrance to her cage.
Caesar emerges into the common area. The chimps are still
asleep.
There's a CLANKING as the OUTSIDE GATE OPENS.
Caesar freezes.
Dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of Primate Chow and the
shovel. Locks the door behind him.
He hasn't seen Caesar yet.
DODGE
Rise and shine, assholes.
The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in
the common area.
THEN DODGE SEES HIM.
DODGE (CONT'D)
What the hell -
(seeing Cornelia's open
CAGE)
You sly son of a bitch. How'd you
do that?
Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds
it in front of him.
He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage.
DODGE (CONT'D)
We're gonna go slow here, alright?
You're gonna go back in your cage,
you're not going to give me no
trouble.
83.
The apes - chimps, orangutans, the gorilla - are silent,
riveted, waiting to see what will happen.
Cornelia stands, watching.
Caesar doesn't take his eyes off Dodge, but his expression is
unreadable.
Dodge reaches Cornelia's cage. He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL
AGAINST THE BARS.
DODGE (CONT'D)
Back!
Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips.
Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples,
Dodge KICKS CORNELIA'S CAGE SHUT.
Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward
the orangutan cage.
DODGE (CONT'D)
We're going to have you fixed,
Einstein, that's for damn sure...
But first we're going to figure out
how you pulled this off...
CAESAR INCHES BACK, KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE'S EYE ON HIM.
DODGE (CONT'D)
Go on. Get in that cage.
Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther.
DODGE (CONT'D)
I said get!
But Caesar doesn't move.
Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement
floor.
He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel
handle. Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage.
DODGE (CONT'D)
Get in that cage, you damn dirty
ape!
 CAESAR'S EYES NARROW. HE STANDS TALL, STRETCHING TO HIS FULL
HEIGHT.
84.
THEN HE STARES DODGE FULL IN THE EYES, DIGS DEEP, AND WITH
TREMENDOUS EFFORT... SPEAKS.
CAESAR
(with his voice)
No!
STUNNED SILENCE.
THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING.
Dodge is thunderstruck - nearly loses his balance.
Caesar has spoken. Actually uttered a word.
Maurice, Rocket, Buck, and all the apes stare, dumbfounded,
trying to comprehend what has just happened.
And then... they go nuts.
SCREAMING. YELLING. JUMPING UP AND DOWN.
That's when Caesar attacks.
He rushes Dodge, wrestling the shovel from his hands.
Dodge spins around to defend himself - and CAESAR HITS HIM IN
THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.
Dodge staggers back.
Caesar SLAMS the shovel in his stomach.
Dodge crumples forward.
CAESAR SWINGS THE SHOVEL UP, SMACKING HIM IN THE FOREHEAD.
Lights out.
Caesar drags Dodge to Rocket's cage and opens the door.
Rocket helps pull him inside.
THEN CAESAR OPENS ALL THE DOORS TO ALL THE CAGES - AND THE
APES COME STREAMING OUT.
They gather around Caesar, who holds up STEWART'S SCISSORS
AND SLICES OPEN HIS OWN PALM.
Then he walks to Rocket, who gets down on his knees and puts
out his hand in the supplicating gesture. CAESAR TAKES THE
SCISSORS AND SLICES ROCKET'S PALM, THEN PRESSES THEIR TWO
HANDS TOGETHER.
85.
He moves to Maurice, who offers up his hand. Caesar slices
the palm and places his hand against it.
Then he turns to Buck - who stands up tall, beats his chest
and YELLS... BUT THEN OFFERS UP HIS HAND.
And now Caesar looks around, as EVERY APE LINES UP, THEIR
OPEN PALMS WAITING.
Will wakes, climbs out of bed, careful not to wake Stewart.
He moves down the hallway, approaching Walter's room. He
pauses, puzzled, at the door - which is AJAR.
Strange.
THE PHONE STARTS TO RING.
Will ignores it -- slowly pushes the door open... AND SEES
CAESAR'S TATTERED PANTS LAID ACROSS THE STRIPPED BED.
He stands there, stunned.
JACOBS (O.S.)
Will? Hello? Will pick up the
goddamned phone!
WILL
Hello?
INTERCUT WITH JACOBS AT THE LAB.
JACOBS
The animal handler - Franklin - was
killed last night. In the primate
house.
WILL
Franklin's dead?
JACOBS
Something very powerful broke his
neck. Snapped it in two.
WILL
Could it have been one of our
chimps?
86.
JACOBS
All our apes are accounted for - 
secured in their cages. But here's
the kicker: One of our security
guards swears he chased a
chimpanzee off the grounds last
night.
Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's
swing.
JACOBS (CONT'D)
Where in the hell did that chimp
come from?!
Mr. Landon answers the RINGING PHONE. He's in his pajamas.
MR. LANDON
The Ranch. Landon speaking.
(LISTENING)
Hey Stewart.
(LISTENING)
Caesar? Dodge fed them breakfast
about half an hour ago...
He holds up a PAIR OF BINOCULARS, looks toward the atrium and
ape houses. Can't see anything wrong.
MR. LANDON (CONT'D)
Let me call you back...
He HEARS THE BACK KITCHEN DOOR OPEN. RUSTLING NOISES in the
kitchen. Opening and closing of cabinets.
MR. LANDON (CONT'D)
Hey Dodge - Stewart just called -
WE FOLLOW HIM out of the living-room, into the...
.kitchen.
MR. LANDON
She said that -
87.
Landon goes pale. ROCKET AND TWO OTHER CHIMPANZEES ARE
STANDING IN THE KITCHEN.
But once inside, the level of destruction is immediately
visible: Overturned table and chairs, plates smashed,
cupboards emptied.
STEWART
Oh my God... I'm calling 911..
Will picks up Landon's BINOCULARS, moves to the front window.
HE SEES: Debris everywhere. Apes free, wandering... DODGE,
LANDON and RODNEY BATTERED AND IN CAGES.
AND - IN THE ATRIUM - SURROUNDED BY HIS CLOSEST FOLLOWERS...
88.
.CAESAR. CLEARLY THE ALPHA MALE. Clearly in control.
WILL
Caesar.
Will lowers the binoculars as Stewart rushes in. She's
trembling.
STEWART
It's going to take them at least
half an hour to get here.
He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an
empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a
couple of stray COOKIES.
He has an idea.
Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON.
STEWART (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
WILL
I'm going to kill him.
STEWART
(HORRIFIED)
Caesar?
WILL
He's dangerous.
STEWART
You're wrong - he can't have been
the one who killed that man -
WILL
There is no other explanation.
A BLACK SHADOW passes by the window. Then another. Stewart
turns. Now there's another.
They're surrounded. She SCREAMS.
Will barricades the back door with a table.
Chimpanzees at every window BANGING ON THE GLASS, wanting in.
GLASS SHATTERS.
Will and Stewart run to the front room, just as the door
CRASHES OFF ITS HINGES - REVEALING BUCK.
89.
WILL
Caesar! I need to talk to you!
Dodge, Rodney and Landon watch as Will and Stewart are pushed
into the cage next door.
WILL (CONT'D)
Caesar!
DODGE
Welcome to the mad house.
STEWART
I called Animal Control - they'll
be here soon -
WILL
(through the bars)
I just want to talk to you!
DODGE
Well this'll be interesting because
your freak'll talk back.
RODNEY
Dodge thinks he spoke to him.
DODGE
He did! He said the word "no" -
right to my face.
WILL
What do you mean?
DODGE
He can talk.
STEWART
That's impossible.
DODGE
Then he must have a voicebox in his
ass, because I heard him!
Caesar walks up.
Will steels himself, feels in his pocket - the POISONED
COOKIE is ready.
0
90.
WILL
Caesar - people are coming. People
with guns. You've got to make the
apes go back in their cages.
CAESAR
(SIGNING)
Apes no belong in cage. Human put
apes in cage.
Will's heart sinks as he sees that Caesar is intransigent.
He means what he's saying.
CAESAR (CONT'D)
(SIGNING)
Never again.
Will takes a moment, DIGS DEEP TO MAKE HIMSELF DO WHAT MUST
BE DONE.
Finally he brings the POISONED COOKIE from his pocket, holds
it out.
WILL
I brought this for you.
Caesar eyes the cookie but doesn't take it.
WILL (CONT'D)
(it's killing him)
Don't you want it?
CAESAR
(SIGNING)
Never.
They look at each other. Two creatures once so close, but
now with a vast chasm between them.
WILL
You went to the lab last night. I
know it was you.
Caesar doesn't deny it.
WILL (CONT'D)
(emotion spilling over)
How could you kill that man,
Caesar? Once you kill you can't it
back - that man's gone forever.
WILL SEES A GENUINE LOOK OF BEWILDERMENT CROSS CAESAR'S FACE.
91.
It gives him pause.
CAESAR
(SIGNING)
Caesar no kill.
WILL
But...
CAESAR
(SIGNING)
Caesar no kill!
Caesar SLAPS the COOKIE from Will's hand.
Rocket immediately comes over to stand by Caesar, but Caesar
doesn't want to fight. He's done - disgusted - with Will.
He turns, begins to walk off.
WILL
Don't walk away. We need to talk.
CORNELIA FALLS IN STEP WITH CAESAR, BUT PAUSES TO SNIFF AT
THE COOKIE ON THE GROUND.
WILL (CONT'D)
Don't - !
TOO LATE - SHE GOBBLES IT UP.
FOR GOOD MEASURE, ROCKET GIVES THE BARS A THREATENING SHAKE,
AND THAT'S WHEN WILL SEES IT: KOBA'S RED WRISTBAND WRAPPED
AROUND KOBA'S ARM.
WILL (CONT'D)
(SHOCKED)
Where'd he get that wristband,
Caesar? That's Koba's band...
(REALIZING)
Did Koba get out of his cage??
Yelling after Caesar.
WILL (CONT'D)
Caesar wait!
But Caesar's not waiting.
Caesar and his chimps BURST THROUGH THE DOOR.
No time is wasted. Cages are opened, LAB CHIMPS liberated.
Koba steps from his cage slowly, measuring the situation as
apes around him go crazy.
Huffs drives - Will in the front, Stewart in back. They can
hear everything through the radio.
WILL
The lab.
HUFFS
You know anything about this?
WILL
That's where I work.
ANARCHY OF MOVEMENT, BLURS of BLACK FUR running amok through
white rooms, tearing everything up.
EMPLOYEES SCATTER - running for the exits. Some duck behind
desks.
ANGLE ON REFRIGERATED CANISTERS OF 113.
Like everything else in the lab, torn down, stomped on,
thrown against the wall.
Caesar and Buck walk through the lab, eyeing the destruction.
95.
Jacobs enters the lab. In front of him is utter silence and
devastation. Like the morning after a huge, destructive
party.
Out of the quiet there's the PADDING SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON
BROKEN GLASS.
Jacobs freezes.
KOBA APPEARS from around a doorway. He and Jacobs look at
each other for a long moment.
Then Koba calmly walks past him.
0
96.
Once outside Koba GALLOPS OFF. Jacobs can see him through
the open doorway disappearing in the direction of the others
Jacobs takes a stumbling step backwards, KICKING SOMETHING
THAT GOES LOUDLY ROLLING ALONG THE CEMENT FLOOR.
IT'S A CRUMPLED CANISTER OF ADENOVIRUS 113. THE NOZZLE'S
BROKEN OFF.
HOFFS
Any idea where they're headed?
Will sees Dodge joining SHARPSHOOTERS in another helicopter
below. He doesn't like it.
WILL
No.
HOFFS
They were seen heading north from
the lab - let's start with that.
Fog rolls in off the bay. Will's strapped into his seat,
looking down at the city below.
HUFFS
You see them?
WILL
No, I can't see -
STEWART
Oh my god.
Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW:
it looks like a BLACK LOCUST moving through the urban sprawl -
chased by numerous Squad Cars - directly behind them, along
parallel streets...
She realizes something.
STEWART (CONT'D)
I know where they're going.
CUT TO:
Will watches Caesar moving the apes down the zoo's pathways,
dodging people, jumping over benches.
WILL
He's going to release the apes.
Looking to his left, Will sees a sniper try to get shots off -
but hesitate.
The apes are too interspersed with fleeing PATRONS.
WRANGLER
What the hell am I supposed to do
when they get here?!
An APE WRANGLER screams into a wall phone at the Ape
Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know
something's coming.
Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers,
turns to see Caesar and his apes.
Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth.
The Wrangler understands - fumbles for his keys.
SOUND OF BOLTS AND LOCKS CLICKING OPEN.
All kinds of apes - Chimps, Orangutans, Gorillas - rush from
their separate enclosures.
Caesar's apes are waiting for them.
Caesar makes eye contact with the GRIZZLED OLD MALE
CHIMPANZEE. Then - as a unit - they all run for the exit.
99.
By now, ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GOING CRAZY.
Above, the sky is full of helicopters now -- some Police, some
News Crews.
Apes are visible streaming from the zoo and emptying onto the
street.
DODGE
That's him! The one with the white
on his shoulder!
A SNIPER takes aim at Caesar - the BULLET RICOCHETS OFF THE
SIDEWALK.
CUT TO:
The TAXI DRIVER - a guy with a THICK MUSTACHE - turns around
to face him.
TAXI DRIVER
Where to, my man?
JACOBS HAS A SHIVER.
JACOBS
24 Marigold.
TAXI DRIVER
Want me to turn down the air?
JACOBS
(DESPONDENT)
Whatever.
HE COUGHS.
CUT TO:
0
100.
Will's plastered to the window, anxiously watching Caesar's
progress.
Below, the BLACK LOCUST that is the pack of apes has grown
larger, but they stay together, moving implacably North
through the San Francisco streets.
Up ahead, the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE COMES INTO VIEW - majestic,
shimmering in the afternoon light.
And Will realizes the moment he sees it.
WILL
They're going to Muir Woods.
(turning to Huffs)
I'm sure of it. He doesn't want to
hurt anyone - he's just trying to
get the apes out of the City!
HUFFS
(INTO HEADSET)
Shut down the Golden Gate Bridge!
WILL
No - let them through!
CUT TO:
Will's gone pale.
STEWART
(ALARMED)
Is he hurt?
WILL
No - not him.
Will and Stewart watch from above as the apes stream
Northward, over and around stopped cars.
HUFFS
(INTO HEADSET)
Tell them to hold their fire until
they get past the traffic!
WILL SEES below that soon Caesar and the apes will reach a
place on the bridge where there are no more cars.
Then they'll be open season.
Then HE SEES the FOUR SQUAD CARS slowly approaching from the
north end of the bridge, SHARPSHOOTERS - and DODGE - on foot
behind them.
ON THE BRIDGE
Caesar looks ahead - realizes that he's at the end of the
bridge traffic.
Ahead is empty roadway. And the slowly approaching squad
cars.
He looks up at the helicopters, rifles at the ready.
103.
He sees the FOG, swirling in and out of the SUSPENSION
CABLES.
Caesar SIGNALS TO MAURICE.
Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and
swirls hundreds of feet below.
Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing,
taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him.
Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car
with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps.
Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into
the fog. Rocket's right behind.
The remaining apes follow.
From the sky Will sees Caesar divide up his army.
Chimps ascend cables, disappearing in and out of patches of
fog.
Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck.
And Buck with his gorilla, take refuge in the stalled
traffic.
BELOW THE BRIDGE
Maurice finds bars and support beams. He and the below-deck
apes begin swinging their way toward the.north end.
ABOVE BRIDGE
Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at
the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top.
They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND
SWIRLING, CHANGING SHAPE AROUND THEM.
A SHARPSHOOTER from a helicopter takes a SHOT.
A CHIMP FALLS TO HIS DEATH. It's a long fall, until - SPLASH
the chimp hits the water.
They keep moving.
0
104.
ON THE BRIDGE
The FOUR PATROL CARS stop, creating a barricade. The
Sharpshooters line up their rifles, ready to shoot.
DODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR, FINDS A RIFLE, AND LOCKS AND
LOADS.
They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the
apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them.
BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables.
Another chimp falls to its death.
Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part
of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's
practically zero.
NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM
IN THE FOG.
OFFICER
They're all around us!
Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH -
WHOOSH...
DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful
of some visibility.
That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG,
CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE.
WITH RELISH, DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE, AIMS AT CAESAR'S BACK.
There's glare from a ray of sunlight that's broken through
the fog.
He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main
cable.
ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE
AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar.
Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES
CAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL.
ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR
UP.
Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO
THE MAIN CABLE.
105.
BAM!
Rocket's hit in the back!
He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE
BRIDGE, TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH.
Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again.
But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON
THE BRIDGE.
The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD
THE BARRICADE.
Like a freight train of menacing power.
Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to
back up.
A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming.
And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade --
MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in.
Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable.
BELOW THE BRIDGE
Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle
waged above is audible.
He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge.
AERIAL VIEW
As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON
CABLES, APES RAMPAGING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE, AND
APES SCAMPERING BELOW.
Vanquishing the humans.
ON THE BRIDGE
THE GORILLAS RUN UP, OVER THE BARRICADE, CRUSHING GUNS AND
CARS.
BUCK'S EYES ARE ON ONE THING.
DODGE.
Terrified but refusing to run, Dodge fires, reloads, fires

again, his face red with the tension of what's to come.
106.
BUCK ARRIVES AT DODGE, PUTS HIS HUGE HANDS ON DODGE'S BODY,
PICKS HIM UP, AND THROWS HIM OFF THE BRIDGE.
Dodge's body twirls through the air -
Will, Stewart and Huffs watch, dumbstruck, as DODGE'S BODY
HITS THE WATER.
Below, the victorious ape army finishes off the battle of the
bridge and follows Caesar through the north exit...
.disappearing into the dense park.
Hunsiker enters, settles into the seat.
TAXI DRIVER
Where to, my man?
It's the Taxi Driver with the mustache - THE SAME ONE THAT
GAVE JACOBS A RIDE HOME.
HUNSIKER
SFO. International terminal.
TAXI DRIVER
You got it.
The Driver COUGHS as he pulls away. Light sweat on his
forehead - he doesn't look too good.
0
112.
CLOSE ON WHEELS TURNING. Hunsiker pulls his suitcase on
wheels through the airport terminal.
It's teeming with TRAVELERS. Holding on to the bannister,
Hunsiker takes the escalator up.
Hunsiker says hello to the FLIGHT STAFF and moves to the
front of the plane.
Hunsiker shakes hands with his CO-PILOT and sits. He flicks
a switch.
