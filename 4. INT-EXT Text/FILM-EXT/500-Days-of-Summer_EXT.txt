For a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on a
park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says
a word.
CLOSE ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No
words are spoken. Tom looks at her the way every woman wants
to be looked at.
A DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us.
NARRATOR
This is a story of boy meets girl.
CUT TO:
(1)
INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
The boy is TOM HANSEN. He sits at a very long rectangular
conference table. The walls are lined with framed blow-up
sized greeting cards. Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t-
shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to
balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored.
NARRATOR
The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New
Jersey, grew up believing that he'd
never truly be happy until the day
he met his... "soulmate."
CUT TO:
INT LIVING ROOM - 1989
PRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie. His
walls are covered in posters of obscure bands. From the TV,
we hear: "Elaine! Elaine!"
4.
NARRATOR
This belief stemmed from early
exposure to sad British pop music
and a total misreading of the
movie, "The Graduate."
CUT TO:
INT OFFICE CUBICLE - PRESENT DAY
The girl is SUMMER FINN. She files folders and answers phones
in a plain white office. She has cropped blonde hair almost
like a boy's but her face is feminine and pretty enough to
get away with it.
NARRATOR
The girl, Summer Finn of
Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share
this belief.
CUT TO:
INT BATHROOM - 1994
Teenage Summer stares at herself in the mirror. Her hair
extends down to her lower back.
NARRATOR
Since the disintegration of her
parents' marriage, she'd only loved
two things. The first was her long
blonde hair.
She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice.
NARRATOR
The second was how easily she could
cut it off... And feel nothing.
CUT TO:
SPLITSCREEN. INT BOARDROOM/ INT CUBICLE - SAME
On the right side of the screen, Tom continues to listen to
some boring presentation. On the left, Summer answers a call,
takes a message, and walks out of her cubicle down a long
narrow hallway.
5.
NARRATOR
Tom meets Summer on January 8th in
a San Francisco office building. In
an instant, he will know she's the
one he's been looking for.
CU Summer opening the door to the boardroom, about to come
face to face with Tom for the first time.
NARRATOR
This is a story of boy meets girl.
But before they do,
CUT TO:
BLACK.
NARRATOR
You should know up front, this is
not a love story.
(240)
EXT STREETS OF SAN FRAN - NIGHT
A 12 year old GIRL rides her bicycle down the block. She
arrives at an apartment complex, jumps off the bike and races
up the front stairs. She rings the doorbell.
INT TOM'S PLACE - LATER
PAUL and MCKENZIE open the door. These are Tom's best friends
since birth. Paul is a doctor and wears hospital scrubs.
McKenzie works in the cubicle next to Tom.
PAUL
I didn't know who else to call.
The Girl removes her bike helmet.
GIRL
You did the right thing. Where is
he?
Tom is in the kitchen breaking things and basically going
insane. About to smash a plate on the floor, he's interrupted
BY:
6.
GIRL
Thomas.
Tom freezes.
TOM
Rachel? What are you doing here?
GIRL (RACHEL)
I'm here to help you.
TOM
Help me how?
RACHEL
First, put down the plate.
Tom slowly obliges.
RACHEL
Now come here and sit down.
Tom sits next to the young girl. Paul and Mckenzie sit on
either side of them.
RACHEL
The key is not to panic.
TOM
I think I'm gonna be sick.
RACHEL
Drink this.
She hands him a glass of water. Tom drinks it down.
MCKENZIE
What is that?
RACHEL
Vodka.
TOM
(grimacing at the taste)
More.
He gulps another down.
TOM
Does Mom know you're here? It's
gotta be past 10.
7.
RACHEL
Don't worry about it. Start from
the beginning. Tell us what
happened...
Tom takes a deep breath.
EXT PARK - DAY
Tom and Summer eat sandwiches in the park.
TOM (V.O.)
We spent the whole day together.
EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY
Tom and Summer walk through the stalls.
TOM (V.O.)
We went shopping.
EXT COFFEE HOUSE - DAY
Tom and Summer seated outside drinking coffee. He reads the
newspaper, she reads a novel.
TOM (V.O.)
We had coffee.
EXT MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Tom and Summer walk out of a movie theatre.
TOM (V.O.)
We saw a film.
INT RECORD STORE - LATER
Tom and Summer shop for music. Tom excitedly shows Summer a
Ringo Starr solo album.
TOM (V.O.)
We bought music.
8.
INT TOM'S PLACE
TOM
I thought it was a great day.
RACHEL
And then what happened?
INT DINER - NIGHT
Tom and Summer in a booth ordering dinner.
TOM
(to WAITRESS)
Um...you know what...let's go
crazy, I'll have BOTH.
(to Summer)
God, I love eating pancakes at
night. It's like the greatest thing
ever. How great is this?
SUMMER
I think we should stop seeing each
other.
INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE
RACHEL
Just like that?
TOM
Just like that.
PAUL
Did she say why?
INT DINER - AS BEFORE
SUMMER
This thing. This whatever it is.
You and me. Do you think this is
normal?
TOM
I don't know. Who cares about
normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you
happy?
9.
SUMMER
You're happy?
TOM
You're not?
SUMMER
All we do is argue!
TOM
That is such a lie!
INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE
RACHEL
Maybe she was just in a bad mood.
PAUL
A hormonal thing.
RACHEL
P.M.S.?
TOM
(to Rachel)
What do you know about PMS?
RACHEL
More than you.
TOM
Oh my god.
MCKENZIE
Please continue.
INT DINER - AS BEFORE
SUMMER
This can't be a total surprise. I
mean, we've been like Sid and Nancy
for months.
TOM
Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven
times with a kitchen knife. We've
had some disagreements but I hardly
think I'm Sid Vicious.
SUMMER
No... I'm Sid.
10.
TOM
(BEAT)
So I'm Nancy?!
The Waitress comes out with the food. Tom and Summer stop
their discussion until the meal is served and the Waitress
leaves. Summer starts to eat.
SUMMER
Let's just eat and we'll talk about
it after. I'm starving.
Without another word she goes back to her pancakes. Tom
watches her eat like this is the worst travesty in the
history of mankind.
SUMMER
(mouth full)
Mmm, you're so right. These are
great!
Tom looks at his food in disgust. He may never eat again.
SUMMER
(INNOCENT)
What?
Tom stands up to go.
SUMMER
Tom, don't. Come back. You're still
my best fr---
THE SCENE FREEZES AND WE ZOOM IN ON TOM'S STUNNED FACE.
INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE
Silence for a few beats.
PAUL
Jesus.
MCKENZIE
That's harsh.
TOM
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
RACHEL
You're gonna be fine.
11.
TOM
(BEAT)
I'm gonna throw up.
MCKENZIE
Or that.
RACHEL
Here.
Tom drinks more vodka.
MCKENZIE
Come on Hansen. You'll be ok.
You're the best guy I know. You'll
find someone.
PAUL
You know what they say...there's
plenty other fish in the sea.
TOM
No.
PAUL
Sure they do. They say that.
TOM
Well they're wrong. It's not true.
I've fished in that sea. I've
jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm
fucking Aquaman!
(to Rachel)
Sorry. What I mean is... there are
no other fish. This was my fish.
Paul and McKenzie share a very concerned look.
CUT TO:
(86)
EXT SIDEWALK - DAY
Tom walks alongside his friend PAUL. Out of nowhere, he says:
TOM
I'm in love with Summer.
12.
PAUL
(BEAT)
For real?
CUT TO:
CU - SUMMER'S SMILE
TOM (V.O.)
I love her smile.
CU - SUMMER'S HAIR
TOM (V.O.)
I love her hair.
CU - SUMMER'S KNEES
TOM (V.O.)
I love her knees.
CU - SUMMER'S EYES
TOM (V.O.)
I love how one eye is higher up on
her face than the other eye.
CU - SUMMER'S NECK
TOM (V.O.)
I love the scar on her neck from
this operation she had as a kid.
CU - SUMMER'S BREASTS (UNDER A BLACK T-SHIRT)
TOM (V.O.)
I love how she looks in my Clash T-
shirt.
CU - SUMMER ASLEEP
TOM (V.O.)
I love how she looks when she's
sleeping.
CU - SUMMER'S LAUGH
TOM (V.O.)
I love the sound of her laugh.
OVER BLACK, play the middle 8 of "Every Little Thing She Does
is Magic" by The Police.
13.
TOM (V.O.)
I love how I hear this song every
time I think of her.
CU - TOM, STARING DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA.
TOM (V.O.)
I love how she makes me feel. Like
anything's possible. Like, I don't
know...like life is worth it.
CUT TO:
EXT SIDEWALK - SAME
Paul and Tom.
TOM
For real, Paul. I'm madly in love
with that girl.
Paul is silent for a beat.
PAUL
Oh shit.
(1)
INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Tom as we saw him earlier. Bored. In the boardroom. Mckenzie
is in mid-presentation.
MCKENZIE
Now I know this may be a little
risque...but if New Hampshire
Greetings wants the jump on those
conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis
at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe
is the wrong approach. The nuclear
family is dead and we need a new
holiday to recognize that.
Mckenzie holds up a home-made photoshopped family portrait of
Martina Navratilova, Ellen DeGeneres, and the kid from "Jerry
Maguire".
14.
MCKENZIE
May 21st. Other Mother's Day.
The co-workers nod and digest this idea. VANCE is the head of
the department.
VANCE
Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea
McKenzie. Along with Grossman's
"Magellan Day" I'd say we've got
some potential here. What do you
think Hansen? Could you write up
some prototypes for these?
Tom is about to answer when... the door opens.
SUMMER
Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There's a
call for you on line 3.
And in walks this girl. Summer. We've met her by now but Tom
hasn't. This is the first time. His eyes go wide and from
that moment on, he can't take them off her.
VANCE
(to the table)
Everyone this is Summer, my new
assistant. Summer just moved here
from...
SUMMER
Michigan.
VANCE
Right. Michigan. Well, Summer,
everyone. Everyone, Summer. Excuse
me, I have to take this.
SUMMER
Nice to meet you all.
Summer gives a little wave before following Vance out.
She doesn't notice Tom whose face looks like he's just seen
God.
15.
(3, 4, 5)
The marquee reads "Part Vampire. Part Giant. `VAGIANT!'"
Tom jogs.
TOM (V.O.)
"One. Exercise. The body's release
of endorphins will assuage the
brain and provide a genuine sense
of accomplishment and success."
Cars pass him at top speed. Bicycles breeze by him. A child
on a big wheel soars past. He may as well be jogging in
place.
Tom backpacks alone in the forest.
TOM (V.O.)
"Five. Travel. Take some time to
see another environment. Get
perspective. It's a beautiful
world. It will be for you again
someday."
This is it, he's finally found some peace. Tom looks up to
the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and
takes a deep breath.
FREEZE ON TOM.
INFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out that
Tom is standing in POISON OAK. There's a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a
step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up
behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER
has Tom sized up in his rifle sight.
UNFREEZE.
Tom starts to itch...
Tom, unshaven, un-showered, walks by himself. He turns a
corner and sees Summer walking towards him. As she gets
closer he sees it's not her after all and breathes a sigh of
relief.
Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost
in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.
SUMMER (V.O.)
Hey.
Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She
may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours.
Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to
do.
SUMMER
(re: suit)
Where you coming from?
TOM
What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have
you been sitting there?
SUMMER
Awhile.
Tom finds it hard to look at her.
110.
SUMMER
I come here a lot. I always loved
this place, ever since you brought
me here.
The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty.
TOM
So... I should probably say
congratulations.
SUMMER
Probably. But only if you mean it.
TOM
I don't know if I do honestly.
SUMMER
I understand.
TOM
Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're
happy.
SUMMER
You really do?
TOM
(BEAT)
God no.
They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate.
SUMMER
How are you, Tom?
TOM
I'm good. Ish.
SUMMER
That's good.
TOM
Yeah I quit the office.
SUMMER
Really? That's great! What are you
doing now?
TOM
Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things.
Awkward silence.
111.
TOM
So who's the guy?
SUMMER
Who, my guy?
TOM
Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I
don't want to know.
SUMMER
Tom...
TOM
No really, I don't.
SUMMER
Ok.
More awkward silence. This one goes on a beat longer. And
THEN:
TOM
It's amazing to me. You're married.
SUMMER
I know.
TOM
You're not only someone's
girlfriend, your someone's wife!
SUMMER
Pretty crazy, huh?
TOM
(SIGHS)
I'll never understand that.
SUMMER
Tom --
TOM
What's different now? How could
things change so quickly?
SUMMER
I don't know. It just happened.
TOM
What happened?! That's what I don't
get.
112.
SUMMER
I... Tom...
TOM
What, tell me...
SUMMER
I woke up one day and I knew.
Tom says nothing.
SUMMER
I knew I could promise him I'd feel
the same way every morning. In a
way that I... I never could with
you.
And there's not much else to say after that.
Tom gets up to leave.
TOM
You know what sucks? Realizing that
everything you believe in is
complete bullshit.
SUMMER
What is?
TOM
Destiny, soulmates, true love. All
that stuff. It's nothing more than
silly childhood fairy tale
nonsense, isn't it? God!
SUMMER
Tom, don't go.
TOM
I should have listened to you,
Summer. You were right all along.
Summer takes a beat to let this hang there.
SUMMER
I was right?
And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.
TOM
What? This is funny?
113.
Tries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's
completely cracking up.
TOM
What are you laughing at?
And she can't stop. She's totally lost control.
TOM
(trying himself not to
LAUGH)
You're a crazy person!
SUMMER
Tom! You're the crazy person!
TOM
What are you talking about?!
SUMMER
One day I'm reading a book at the
corner deli and this guy sits down
and starts asking about it. Now
he's my husband!
TOM
This is funny to you?
SUMMER
What would have happened if I went
to the movies instead? If I went
somewhere else for lunch? If I
showed up to eat ten minutes later?
Tom, it was meant to be, just like
you said. And as it was happening,
I knew it. I could feel it, sure as
the sun. And I kept thinking to
myself "Holy shit. Tom was right."
You were right about all of it.
(BEAT)
It just wasn't me you were right
about.
Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her
wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact
shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a
few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.
SUMMER
Anyway, I should probably be
getting back. It was good to see
you. I'm glad you're well.
114.
Summer gets up and starts walking away from him. After a
SECOND:
TOM
Summer!
She stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely
for the last time ever.
TOM
I really do hope you're happy.
SUMMER
I know.
(BEAT)
See you later.
And she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving
Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every
second.
FADE OUT:
A FEW SECONDS OF BLACK, BEFORE...
FADE IN:
(500)
INT OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY
Tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches
at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers
Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big
time.
Tom waits.
We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a
another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.
GIRL
Are you here to interview?
TOM
Sorry?
115.
GIRL
Are you interviewing? For the
position?
TOM
Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?
GIRL
Yup.
TOM
Ah. My competition.
GIRL
It would appear.
TOM
Gee, this is a little awkward.
GIRL
Yes it is.
TOM
Well, I hope you don't get it.
GIRL
I hope you don't get it.
They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's
during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we
can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this
girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her.
And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.
TOM
So, uh...
GIRL
Hmm?
TOM
Are you from...California?
GIRL
Grew up not too far from here.
Atherton, near Stanford.
TOM
I know Atherton. Nice area.
GIRL
Have I seen you before?
116.
TOM
I, uh, don't know. I don't think
so.
GIRL
Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to
pray or anything but to stand
outside?
TOM
I do! I love that church. It's like
my favorite structure in the city.
GIRL
If only it wasn't near that
horrible mirrored thing...
TOM
Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!
GIRL
Yeah.
(BEAT)
I think I've seen you there.
TOM
You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see
you.
GIRL
It happens. You probably weren't
looking.
A MAN comes out.
MAN
Tom Hansen?
TOM
Yes.
MAN
Come on back.
TOM
Thank you.
He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses
and looks back at the girl.
117.
NARRATOR
If Tom had learned anything... it
was that you can't ascribe great
cosmic significance to a simple
earthly event. Coincidence. That's
all anything ever is. Nothing more
than coincidence.
ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast.
Hardly noticeable. But it's there.
NARRATOR
It took a long time but Tom had
finally learned. There are no
miracles. There's no such thing as
fate. Nothing is meant to be. He
knew. He was sure of it now.
(BEAT)
Tom was...
Tom turns back around.
NARRATOR
...pretty sure.
TOM
(to Girl)
Excuse me.
GIRL
Hello stranger.
TOM
When this is over... uh... would
you like to maybe...grab a cup of
coffee or something?
GIRL
Oh. I'm sorta supposed to meet
someone.
TOM
(DEFLATED)
Oh. Got it... No problem.
He turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on
the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears.
GIRL
Ok.
Tom turns back around.
118.
TOM
What's that?
GIRL
Why not?
TOM
Yeah?
GIRL
Yeah.
TOM
Great! So... I'll wait for you
here, or you wait for me
or...something.
She laughs. She's cute when she laughs.
GIRL
We'll figure it out.
TOM
Ok!
(extends hand to shake)
My name's Tom.
GIRL
Nice to meet you...
She puts out her hand to meet his. They shake.
GIRL
I'm Autumn.
And on his face...
