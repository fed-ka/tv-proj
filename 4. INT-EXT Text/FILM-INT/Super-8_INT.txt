Close on CHARLES' MOTHER AND FATHER, funeral attire. She
looks out of the window sadly; heartsick and concerned.
Behind her, he picks at his plate of food.
CHARLES' MOTHER
I'm so worried for that boy.
CHARLES' FATHER
Joe's gonna be okay.
2.
CHARLES' MOTHER
...she was everything to him.
CHARLES' FATHER
Jack's gonna step up. He's a good
man.
CHARLES' MOTHER
But he was never really a
father...I don't think he
ever...understood Joe.
CHARLES' FATHER
(maybe a little concerned
HIMSELF)
Joe's gonna be okay.
But his wife isn't so sure.
Then, BOYS' HUSHED VOICES:
CHARLES (we'll see him in a moment) LEANS FORWARD, reaching
for food on a buffet table. Charles' leaning has revealed
CARY, a blonde kid in a dark blue sport jacket and tie, and
PRESTON, pale and smart, in a DARK SWEATER:
CARY
What do you think was in the
coffin?
MARTIN
Jesus, shut up.
CARY
I mean cause of how she died.
CARY (CONT'D)
... you weren't wondering that?
PRESTON
No, I'm eating macaroni salad.
We now see CHARLES, big and in an ill-fitting BLACK SUIT, and
MARTIN, good looking, in a shirt and tie, at the buffet:
CHARLES
I was thinking that, about the
coffin.
MARTIN
I don't know how you guys can eat.
3.
CHARLES
Try a Goddamn turkey roll and
you'll discover how. They're
delicious.
CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the
year 1979. At a wake. Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly
dressed. Quiet discussions. Some crying.
CARY
Either nothing was in there, or
like whatever they scraped up--
MARTIN
Jesus -- guys--
CHARLES MARTIN
I heard it crushed her
completely. At least keep your voices
DOWN--
PRESTON CHARLES
A steel beam-- those things
weigh a ton. Literally. If it had been open casket, I
would not be eating right
now. Despite the turkey
rolls.
JACK (O.S.)
Hey-- Lucy.
They look up -- in the other room, a dog (mutt, Lucy) has
jumped on a guest, for food. JACKSON LAMB, Joe's father, 42,
black suit, moves to the dog, walks her out of shot.
CHARLES
Bet Joe's not gonna wanna do my
movie anymore.
CARY
Why?
CHARLES
Why do you think why? The story.
It's about the living dead.
PRESTON
His mother's not a zombie.
CHARLES
But she's dead, shithead.
CARY
Those turkey rolls are pretty good.
4.
CHARLES
Told you.
Joe, Charles and Cary scan the candy aisle.
JOE
-- driving where?
7.
CHARLES JOE
To the train depot -- did you
not read the scene I just
gave you? Does Alice have a license? Is
she old enough? Whose car are
we taking? Are you making
this up?
CHARLES
Jesus, Freak Show, she offered to
drive and I accepted--
CARY
(takes scene pages)
Can I see --?
JOE
-- was she nice? Why is she doing
this? I don't understand, we don't
even know her--
CHARLES
Maybe she just wants to be in a
good movie, y'ever think of that?
JOE
I don't think that's what it is--
CHARLES
I've been working on this movie for
months. I'm just trying to make it
good.
CARY
(reading, disapproving)
Hathaway's married now? Really?
Charles swipes the pages from critic Cary.
JOE
What was she reading?
CHARLES
... what?
JOE
In the silent reading section, what
was Alice reading?
CHARLES
Who gives a rat's ass what she was
reading-- the festival deadline's
in one week -- my movie's gotta be
great!
8.
CHARLES' SUPER 8 MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A MOVIE SCREEN.
SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE SCREEN: kids earnestly playing adults:
DARKNESS. Then a DOOR OPENS. It's DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played
by MARTIN), in silhouette. He enters. It's an old WAREHOUSE,
dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY,
CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his
FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the
light HITTING THE LENS for a moment.
The Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low,
growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy.
Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the
Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We
see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK
DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar.
Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for
it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a
terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the
Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND --
and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie
DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize
that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The
Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist
-- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip
into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED
NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and
after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK
so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS
SKULL!!! The Zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails)
SCREAMS AND DIES and just at Hathaway catches his breath THE
IMAGE DIMS AND FREEZES; the projector has just been STOPPED.
We are in:
Board games, books, records, a stereo, toys, and magic. Super
8 film equipment and paraphernalia. Movie ONE SHEETS hang:
CARRIE, HALLOWEEN, EARTHQUAKE and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.
No sports memorabilia. Charles turns on the lights, looks
anxiously at Joe:
JACK
That was a good zombie murder.
CHARLES
Yeah, but it's not a st-- thank you
for that-- it's not a story yet.
(MORE)
9.
CHARLES (CONT'D)
Older kids enter this film festival
-- I'm competing with fifteen- and
sixteen-year-olds, who have better
stories and cars and production
value, I've got nothing!
CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)
Charles! Dinner!
As he tosses Joe a SUPER 8 FILMMAKER MAGAZINE:
CHARLES
I'm coming!
(TO JOE)
There's a whole article in there
about stories, you should read it,
it explains everything.
JOE
(looks at magazine)
I don't understand how the wife
makes it a story--
CHARLES CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)
Jesus, that's what I've been
explaining: in the scene
we're filming tonight, the
wife telling the detecting
she's scared for him, that
she loves him-- Charles!
-- I'M COMING!!!
-- so when he investigates
the zombie stuff you'll be
scares -- you'll feel
something -- because you
don't want him to die because
they love each other! Does
that make sense?
JOE (CONT'D)
I just can't believe you talked to
Alice Dainard.
CHARLES
You're impossible.
CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)
CHARLES!
CHARLES
GOD, MOM! I'M COMING!
(opens the door, whispers)
Midnight. Okay? Don't forget.
10.
JOE
I won't forget.
CHARLES
Read this.
Joe just nods and looks at the magazine.
A hectic FAMILY: Charles' mother cooks. JEN, his smoking hot
17-year-old sister, ANGRILY sets the table where his father
pays bills. Pale 15-year-old sister PEG does a PUZZLE. Twin 9-
YEAR-OLD BOYS bicker over an action figure. TV in the living
room plays a MATCH GAME. Joe and Charles enter.
JEN
Mom, it's not fair that I can't go
to Wendy's. Every single person is
going except me!
CHARLES' MOTHER
Then every single person can tell
you how it was --
CHARLES' FATHER
Move the puzzle, get the napkins.
JEN
MOM---
CHARLES' MOTHER
It's your turn to babysit.
JEN
So...
PEG
Get off that thing.
JEN
Mom, why can't I switch with
Charles?
CHARLES
Because you crushed Charles' top
hat, you ever think of that?
Disgusted, Jen LOUDLY sets Charles' place as --
JEN
Oh, really, guess what? We're
switching.
11.
Charles grabs a roll.
CHARLES
Guess what, no we're not.
CHARLES' MOTHER
Charles take these to the table!
Benji, it's time for dinner. Hey,
JOE--
JOE
Goodnight, Mrs. Kaznyk--
CHARLES' MOTHER
Grab a seat, we have lots of food.
JOE
Oh no thanks, Ma'am, I'm okay.
(to Charles, loaded)
"See you tomorrow."
CHARLES
Later days.
CHARLES' FATHER
There's always a place for you
here, you know that--
JOE
Oh, yessir. Thank you.
Joe leaves; Charles' parents share a look of pity for Joe.
Joe comes into the kitchen through the BACK DOOR. Lucy the
dog greets him. A TV is head somewhere. NIGHTLY NEWS reports
on the ONGOING CLEAN-UP OF THREE MILE ISLAND. A half-empty
BEER BOTTLE on the table. Joe peeks into the living room --
but no one's there.
Joe looks around for his father. Heads down the hallway.
Stops when he sees something off camera. We HOLD on Joe's
face, sort of quietly stunned.
12.
And we se his POV: Jack, Joe's father, in uniform pants and T-
shirt, sits on the edge of the bathtub, head in his hands,
quietly CRYING.
Joe is stunned, staring at his dad. But he can't look away.
And when he finally starts to head off, Jack looks up. Joe's
mind scrambles for something to say, but Jack sniffles, gets
it together, quick. Puts on a strong face.
JACK
Hey -- I'll be out in a minute--
Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door.
HOLD ON JOE. Stunned and heartsick.
Commodores quietly sing "EASY" on the PA. Joe and his father,
in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack eats a
beef stew and reviews office paperwork, not looking at his
son. Joe eats a grilled cheese, deeply lonely and not even
knowing it.
Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table:
JACK
It's a six-week program, hands-on
training with college coaches.
(BEAT)
You'll like it. I know I did.
Joe looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP. Images of
happy, smiling, healthy ATHLETIC KIDS. Not his thing.
JOE
I thought I was going to have the
summer for myself--
JACK
Things have obviously changed for
us. And it'd be good for you to
spend some time with kids who don't
run around with-- cameras and
MONSTER MAKE-UP--
JOE
I gotta help Charles finish his
movie.
JACK
I have nothing against your
friends. I like your friends.
(MORE)
13.
JACK (CONT'D)
Except Cary, who can't stop
lighting things on fire. You'll
like it there.
(FINALLY)
It's what we both need.
Joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up
from under the table -- and Jack sees that Joe is HOLDING HIS
MOTHER'S LOCKET. Jack wants to cry again. He wants to throw
that locket away, out of sight. But he just turns away.
Joe stares at the pamphlet. PUSH IN on the photo of beaming
15-year-old KIDS. Then CUT TO THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME:
TIGHT ON QUASIMODO; a plastic, painted AURORA model. RACK
FOCUS to the paintbrush that comes into frame -- FOLLOW IT TO
JOE, holding the brush, at his desk, making a model. A boy's
room recently devoid of a mother's oversight; a mess. COMIC
BOOKS and other PLASTIC MODELS, all built and painted by Joe.
CARS and CREATURES and a TRAIN. His bedside CLOCK RADIO
(11:56 PM) quietly plays "BAKER STREET." Then a RADIO SQUAWK -
- Joe grabs a KID'S WALKIE-TALKIE:
CHARLES (V.O.)
Okay, it's time -- don't get
caught, over.
JOE
I won't. Over.
Joe turns off the walkie -- and he grabs a small plastic
FISHERMAN'S TACKLE BOX as we HEAR:
CHARLES (V.O.)
Wanna hear something gross?
CARY (V.O.)
I do.
MARTIN (V.O.)
No please, if you're really asking.
Alice drives. The boys shoved in the back with the gear -- in
front Charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as
he pulls out PAGES, arranging them. With her driving, there's
an unusual, electric energy in the air. Joe eats his
Twizzlers in the back, trying not to stare at Alice.
CHARLES
So I wrote a couple new lines, can
I show you?
ALICE
What?
MARTIN
New lines? Charles-- what, I have
new lines?
CHARLES
Shut up. There aren't a lot--
ALICE
I'm sorta trying to drive--
CHARLES
What would be great is: could you
cry during the scene? Can you do
that?
ALICE
... no...?!
Cary messes with the radio. Alice moves his hand away.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Stop.
CARY
You know the first place I'm gonna
drive when I get my license?
JOE
(offering to Alice)
Want one?
Alice looks at him in the rear view. Their eyes hold a beat.
17.
CARY
New Castle, Pennsylvania. Fireworks
capital of America.
She takes the Twizzler he offers and looks back to the road.
MARTIN
So I don't have any new lines,
right? Because I just learned
these.
CHARLES
Shut up.
PRESTON
I have never been a passenger in a
vehicle without an adult driving.
I'm unresolved as to how I feel
about it.
Preston sets up the lights as Cary arrives to show him his
backpack full of FIRECRACKERS:
CARY
I took apart two packs of cherry
bombs and made my own M-80.
PRESTON
Your obsession with fireworks --
and I'm saying this as a friend --
concerns me. And my mother.
CARY
Well you're a pussy. And your mom
has one.
Cary takes off. Martin returns with his paper.
19.
MARTIN
Bogus, Cary.
Overlapping mayhem, but Charles obsesses over his camera:
CHARLES PRESTON
Holy shit, that was insane! He had a gun! An actual
physical gun!
CARY CHARLES
I can't believe all that just
happened here! Nothing ever My whole camera lends is like
happens here!!! shattered now!
PRESTON
My heart is pounding! That train
could of killed us.
JOE
(TO ALICE)
Are you okay?
As Alice nervously drives, she shakes her head: no.
CHARLES
Oh shit, all the glass just fell
out!
MARTIN
I HAVE NEVER HAD A TEACHER AIM A
GUN AT ME!
ALICE
It's hard enough to drive without
everyone yelling!
32.
JOE
Guys, keep it down!
CARY JOE
Joe: what was Woodward
talking about? I don't know, I don't know--
MARTIN
I'm never taking a train again.
PRESTON
"You'll die, your parents will
die," guys, that is not good
information.
CHARLES
Great, the focus ring just fell
off!
CARY
No one cares about your CAMERA!
MARTIN
Am I the only one shaking?! I'm
also crying --
ALICE
We can't tell anyone we were there -
- we can't say a thing about it --
my dad cannot find out I took his
car, do you guys hear me?!
JOE
It's okay-- no one's saying
anything. None of us.
(to his friends)
Guys -- we're not gonna say
anything -- are we?!
The boys all muster, "no's." Joe turns sweetly to Alice.
JOE (CONT'D)
See? No one's gonna know.
Alice nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Joe.
But they all stare off for a long beat... haunted.
Joe in the bath. The quiet SWISH of water as Joe holds the
CUBIC OBJECT. He relives the night: he mouths explosions.
Remembers the fear... then he smiles.
Joe is STARTLED AWAKE as if from a nightmare; Jack has awoken
him, quickly bucking his holster, urgent:
JACK JOE
Gotta head in early -- -- okay--
Make sure you let Lucy out. -- I will --
Pull back WIDE to see Joe's room -- while in the FOREGROUND
is his desk, crowded with stuff. In focus, however, is the
CUBED OBJECT he took from the crash site. As the shot
progresses, you may notice that THE CUBE HAS CHANGED SHAPE;
THE VOLUME IS THE SAME, BUT THE CORNERS HAVE EXTENDED.
JACK JOE
You gonna -- what, you with
Charles today? Yeah, I'll be with Charles--
Make sure you get the yard. -- okay, I will.
Jack heads off.
34.
TIGHT SHOT: Joe fills Lucy's FOOD DISH with kibble. No dog.
Typical Kaznyk bustle: Father busily packs sack lunches. Hot
Jen eats cereal, reads a magazine. One Twin plays HANDBALL
loudly against a wall. Peg keeps walking through the scene
with clothes. Mother cooks, says to the other twin (in grimy
SHORTS):
JEN
Mom, come on!
CHARLES' MOTHER
No. You're not wearing that. No one
in this house is wearing that.
JEN
Compared to Debbie's these are
long.
CHARLES' FATHER
Just listen to your mother.
JEN
I can't wear these or go to Wendy's
party? This is not fair.
CHARLES' MOTHER
Jennifer Anne, not fair is Africa.
JEN
Mom's racist.
PEG
Are there anymore English muffins?
CHARLES' MOTHER
I don't know, go check.
CHARLES' FATHER
Peg, tell the twins to stop.
PEG
They don't listen to me.
35.
CHARLES' FATHER
Hi, Joe.
It all continues as Joe has entered from the front door.
JOE
Morning, Mr. Kaznyk--
CHARLES' MOTHER
Hi, Joe. Did you hear about the
train accident?
JOE
Uh... no.
CHARLES' MOTHER
It's on the news.
Joe is moving toward the living room, where Charles sits on
the sofa, eyes glued to the TV, A TRAIN CRASH BEING REPORTED
ON THE LOCAL NEWS; HELICOPTER SHOT of the wreck. The CHYRON
READS, "TRAIN DERAILED - AIR FORCE AIDS CLEAN UP." Joe sits
beside Charles. They both watch, stunned, as a PHOTO OF DR.
WOODWARD appears on the TV, with the heading "DRIVER OF TRUCK
CRITICALLY INJURED, BEING TREATED." WHISPERED:
CHARLES
Can you believe this?
JOE
No.
CHARLES
It's on the news. That means it's
real.
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
Meanwhile, local science teacher
Thomas Woodward is still being
treated by Air Force medical
personnel after last night's train
derailment. Woodward apparently
fell asleep at the wheel of his
pick-up truck, which was hit by the
speeding train at approximately one
AM. Eighty-two train cars were
thrown from the tracks in the
derailment, the largest such
accident in Ohio's history. The
condition of Woodward, who has
taught at Lillian Middle School for
the past six years, remains
unknown.
36.
Both stare at the train crash, stunned. Finally, quietly:
JOE
... Looks like a disaster movie,
doesn't it...?
And we PUSH IN ON CHARLES, going from depressed and lost to
INSPIRED:
CHARLES
(WHISPERS)
... oh my God, Joe... that's
AWESOME--
JOE
-- what?
CHARLES
We can use this -- we can film it --
JOE
(starts to smile)
-- you wanna go back?!
CHARLES JOE
(turns to him) --okay--
Holy shit, that's mint.
You're a total brain--! We
gotta get the camera fixed
and the film developed from
last night-- I gotta go steal
some more money from my mom!
Joe at the counter, DIALING THE ROTARY PHONE, Charles behind
him with DONNY, the 19-year-old, dark-haired, bearded
salesman with a big collared button-down shirt.
CHARLES
Lens is cracked. Focus ring broke.
(BEAT)
Ya think it's fixable?
Joe HEARS Alice's phone number RINGING.
DONNY
I think it's cheaper to buy a new
one.
CHARLES
(TO JOE)
We're screwed, man, it's over!
JOE ALICE (V.O.)
We can use my dad's camera --
it's got sound and-- Hello?
JOE
Alice-- hi, it's Joe. Lamb.
As Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film:
ALICE (V.O.)
Hi...
JOE
So we have some new scenes. For the
movie. We were hoping you'd be in
`em.
ALICE (V.O.)
Oh-- no. No, I'm done with that.
Joe twirls a hanging Kodak "RELIVE THE MEMORIES" SUPER 8 film
PROMOTIONAL SIGN, speaking in a soft voice:
JOE
Really? `Cause these are really
good scenes.
Charles hands the film cartridge to Donny.
CHARLES
We need this developed as soon as
possible -- can you do overnight?
39.
DONNY
Asshole, no one can do overnight.
You wanna buy some pot?
Charles reacts; he's never smoked anything.
CHARLES
... no, thank you.
DONNY
You guys are weak.
ALICE (V.O.)
I'm watching the crash on the news.
JOE
Yeah, I know, I saw it.
(CONCERNED)
Are you okay?
CHARLES
Well, what's the fastest you can
do?
DONNY
I can make it a rush, you get the
film back in three days-- what's
your sister up to? The hot one, not
the other one.
CHARLES
I don't know.
ALICE (V.O.)
I should go.
JOE ALICE (V.O.)
-- wait, hold on -- lemme
come over and show you the
pages, okay? I'll be right
there. No, d--
The kids sit at a table at the window. The CAR LOT is across
the street. They're talking excitedly but quietly:
JOE
I make models-- plastic ones-- you
know, glue `em, paint `em--
PRESTON
And he's not embarrassed by that.
CARY
Looks who's talking, Math Camp.
A WAITRESS is there, delivering more FOOD --
CHARLES
Thanks, could I have a coffee,
please? Cream on the side?
WAITRESS
(really?)
Sure.
She heads off. Cary smiles at Alice.
CARY
He is so sophisticated.
CHARLES CARY
Shut up, I like coffee. No one likes coffee.
ALICE
Keep going.
JOE
Air Force trains -- even models --
have these hooks...
PRESTON
Ooo! Ooo ooo ooo! They do -- for
when their train cars are put on
transport ships.
44.
JOE
Every car in that crash had hooks,
every one...
CHARLES
Joe: stop talking about it.
MARTIN
Am I the only one who doesn't
understand what this all means?
CARY
Probably, Smartin.
MARTIN
Shut up, I don't like that--
JOE PRESTON
Dr. Woodward had that map.
He drove onto the tracks.
Maybe there was something-- -- he wanted to destroy,
he wanted to destroy? yeah.
CHARLES
Please shut up, all of you.
CARY
I say he was just sick of being old
and wanted to kill himself.
JOE
He had a gun, why not use that?
PRESTON
There are infinitely more effective
ways to commit suicide: pills,
HANGING--
CARY CHARLES
Pussy, stop pulling the fries
away. I ordered these for a reason.
-- he gets all possessive
with his fries, it's so
annoying.
PRESTON (CONT'D)
You could jump from a building.
MARTIN
Fall down stairs.
PRESTON
Well, that's not really effective.
45.
ALICE
So, if it's Air Force, what would
the Air Force have on a train?
CHARLES
(WHISPER YELLING)
SHHHHJESUS! You heard what the Old
Man said, we can't talk about this!
(to waitress, with coffee)
-- thank you, very much.
PRESTON
Drowning, hari kari, also known as
seppuku--?
CARY
Excuse me, could we please get
another order of fries because my
friend here is fat?
CHARLES
Funny, Chompers, at least I don't
use a booster seat.
MARTIN
What was your teacher even talking
about? Who are we supposed to be
afraid of anyway?
CHARLES
I don't wanna find out -- guys, we
gotta forget we were there. Joe,
seriously... you really wanna take
a chance that something could
happen to your dad, too?
This lands for Joe -- for all of them -- as we CUT TO:
Jack is with Sheriff Pruitt, who stands, distracted, picking
up reports from his desk, on his way out.
JACK
They gave me the run around for two
hours before I was allowed to talk
to anyone.
PRUITT
I'd say they have their hands full,
wouldn't you?
JACK
Nelec -- the Colonel -- refused to
show me their manifest, said they
were carrying mostly airplane parts-
PRUITT
It's Air Force, Jack. Airplane
parts sorta make sense.
JACK
Sheriff, I'm telling you, there's
something else going on -- they're
taking molds of tire tracks -- now
why would they be doing that? Who
are they looking for? And they're
packing these weird little cubes
into crates and they're--
PRUITT
Weird little cubes?
JACK
--yeah, into these red trucks,
dozens of these trucks -- and I'm
telling you, they're scrambling to
get the hell outta there--
PRUITT
I'd say that's a good thing,
wouldn't you?
JACK
Sheriff, I think you need to go
check it out.
PRESTON
And I think you need a break.
(BEAT)
Jack, I've been telling you this
since Elizabeth.
(MORE)
48.
PRESTON (CONT'D)
You're a good deputy. But you need
to take a vacation.
(BEAT)
Go home. Take off your uniform. Go
fishing. And give your son a hug.
Pruitt walks off. Jack, unsettled, watches him go.
FINGERS TAPPING -- they're fingers on a COUNTER, a WALKMAN
sitting beside them. BOOM UP to 23-year-old BREEN, who digs
the BLONDIE he's listening to. He is alone in the station
store. Behind him, 60-year-old SHERIFF PRUITT enters.
SHERIFF PRUITT
Hey Breen, I'm not sure Edie's
paying you to listen to the radio.
Breen doesn't respond. The sheriff throws a candy bar at him.
SHERIFF PRUITT (CONT'D)
Breen.
Breen pulls off the headphones.
BREEN
Hey, Sheriff.
SHERIFF PRUITT
What's that?
BREEN
Walkman. It's like a stereo, play
your own cassette tapes.
(OFFERS HEADPHONES)
You wanna try it?
SHERIFF PRUITT
(pays for the candy bars)
I don't think so. Kids walking
around with their own stereos. Just
what we need. It's a slippery
slope.
He exits the store.
BREEN
... yessir.
Pruitt heads out; Breen puts the headphones on again.
49.
Breen, eyes closed, blasts his Walkman (we only hear TINNY
MUSIC) as, through the window behind him, the rear of the
squad car SUDDENLY SPRINGS UPWARD VIOLENTLY as if the FRONT
SECTION WAS SUDDENLY CRUSHED! PRUITT SCREAMS, MUFFLED, as the
CAR SLAMS back to the pavement -- LIGHTS FLICKER --
PRUITT'S SCREAMS END as Breen OPENS HIS EYES AND RIPS off the
headphones: the hell was that? He looks outside -- sees the
car -- shattered windows. Confused, he heads out --
Breen RUSHES INSIDE -- we're WITH HIM as behind him:
KKKRASH!!!! An EXPLOSION OF GLASS AND JUNK FOOD and --
50.
Joe makes her up -- a not half-bad, simple ZOMBIE MAKE-UP.
Pale skin, sunken eyes and cheekbones. In the background, the
other kids prepare to film.
He hands her a mirror, she gazes into it, sort of amazed.
ALICE
Where'd you learn how to do this?
JOE
Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make-
up Handbook.
She nods. Whatever. Charles is suddenly there, with Cary:
CHARLES
Hey! So I'm gonna need more shots
of the train crash, obviously-- you
know that train model you made? Can
we blow it up and film it?
Joe doesn't want to do this at all. AT ALL. But...
JOE
... sure.
CHARLES CARY
Mint. Gnarly!
Charles and Cary head off, planning the explosions. Alice
looks at him knowingly.
JOE (CONT'D)
I don't care, they can blow it up.
I can show you the train, it's
nothing, it's stupid.
(BEAT)
(MORE)
51.
JOE (CONT'D)
You wanna see it? Later? The...
train? My train model? The train I
made?
The LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE DIM -- BROWN OUT -- then back on.
CHARLES MARTIN
That's like the third time Dude. Bitchen.
that's happened.
ALICE
So how am I supposed to be a
zombie?
JOE
Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul.
Someone with no soul, dead eyes.
Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin?
ALICE
For English? Yeah--
JOE
-- like her. But hungry, like
hungry for human flesh. To make
them turn into zombies, because
that's what zombies do.
Alice considers this -- then, after a beat, starts doing her
best zombie. Joe smiles, `cause it's pretty good.
JOE (CONT'D)
Oh my God. That's really good...
And Alice slowly leans in toward him -- is this performance?
Or is this something else--? And she PUTS HER MOUTH ON HIS
NECK IN A FAKE BITE, which makes Joe go still -- a shiver
down his spine -- he's never felt anything like this in his
life. And when she pulls back, her performance over, she's
smiling. He doesn't know what to say, tries to stay cool.
JOE (CONT'D)
... not bad.
KA-BAM: back door opens, Joe enters. EMPTY PIZZA BOX on the
table. Jack and four POLICE OFFICERS in the living room,
smoking, reviewing POLICE REPORTS, marking MAPS, taking notes
-- WORKING ON THE PROBLEMS THEY'RE HAVING --
OFFICER MIKE
We need more help around here.
OFFICER GORDON
We've got four men on the Pruitt
case alone. We've called into
Dayton, they'll be out in the
MORNING----
55.
JACK
That's not enough. People don't
feel safe here -- and you know why?
`Cause they're not--
The officers agree. Joe moves into the doorway where his dad
and other convene.
JACK (CONT'D)
-- the Air Force isn't answering a
damn question: they've got trucks
at Woodward's house, looking for
SOMETHING --
OFFICER
They've got trucks all over town.
OFFICER JAY
I saw a guy riding shotgun in one
of those trucks -- had some kind of
scanner in his hand --
DEPUTY TALLY
--like a Geiger counter or
SOMETHING--
JACK
I know. They're saying it's just
clean-up at the train crash, but
they're taking molds of tire
tracks. Which means they're looking
for someone-- now what's that
about?
Joe has heard this and DROPPED HIS FLASHLIGHT -- the men all
turn, silent. Joe, on the spot:
JOE
-- have you... seen Lucy?
JACK
I'm sure she's around. I put a
couple of slices in the fridge for
you there.
DEPUTY TALLY
-- oh-- I ate those. Sorry, Kid--
JOE
That's... okay, I'll find a--
Then the POWER GOES OUT -- the men react -- it FLICKERS ON
AND OFF -- Jack grabs his radio a the POWER RETURNS:
56.
JACK
Vicky, you got power at the
station?
DISPATCH (V.O.)
On and off. Brook County's in the
dark.
JACK
Get water and power out there now.
Joe paints his model on the floor of his living room,
watching In Search Of and talking to Charles on his walkie
talkie.
JOE
So the Air Force is looking for a
car -- Alice's dad's car -- they're
taking tire prints from the crash
site. Over.
CHARLES
I don't wanna hear about it. They
could be monitoring us right now!
Jesus, shut up. Over!
JOE
(VERY CONCERNED)
And the military's at Woodward's
house. Looking for his research.
Whatever that means?
CHARLES
Joe -- YOU CAN NOT FLAKE OUT ON ME
AND BE A DICK! Are you gonna come
help me tomorrow or not? I need you
to make Alice a zombie again.
And Joe tries to snap himself out of it. But is disturbed.
JOE
Okay... I'll do the make-up. Over.
ROONEY, 49. Cigarette in his mouth, makes notes on a
weathered clipboard. Glances at the power line. Doesn't
understand what he sees -- PUSH IN ON HIM. He radios in:
ROONEY
This is Rooney at Mary-10, was
there re-routing on this line?
VOICE (V.O.)
Negative, but the grid through
Liberty is dark.
ROONEY
... yeah, `cause there's no
overhead lines on these poles.
VOICE (V.O.)
-- come again?
ROONEY
No power, no comm cables. Stand by.
He DRIVES AGAIN -- we see a WIDE SHOT OF THE LANDSCAPE --
HALF A DOZEN UTILITY POLES -- ALL BARE -- NOT ONE WIRE.
A LOUD TOWN MEETING. Two-hundred frustrated CITIZENS crowd
the auditorium. Jack at the podium, TOWN OFFICIALS, including
the local MAYOR sit on stage as well. Currently, MRS. BABBIT,
52, speaks into the microphone on the floor:
59.
MRS. BABBIT
Twenty microwave ovens: gone from
my inventory. Brook County's
without power -- this feels to me
like a Russian invasion.
The town ROARS its approval -- Jack, impotent, tries:
JACK
Mrs. Babbit, I don't believe the
Russians have anything to do with
what's happening in town-- but I'm
calling the curfew because w--
MRS. BABBIT
Until you can tell me who's messing
with us, I say it's the Soviets and
we're at war. I like you, Jack, but
we need Sheriff Pruitt back.
The town ERUPTS in agreement --
JACK
We have good people working on
that. Mr. McCandless.
A short, bald man of 65, MR. MCCANDLESS speaks:
MR. MCCANDLESS
Since Wednesday morning, my Ham
radio's been a mess -- all sorts of
frequencies I like to scan. Some
kind of buzz modulation-- have you
found that?
PUSH IN ON JACK, HEARING THIS --
JACK
Mr. McCandless, can I speak with
you for a moment, privately?
The Mayor takes over as Jack has a SIDEBAR MEETING with Mr.
MCCANDLESS:
MR. MCCANDLESS JACK
-- it was like having my -- that must be very annoying-
radio hi-jacked-- - you don't know the
frequencies off-hand, do you?
-- sure I do: 13201 to 13710, (pulls out paper, pen)
15015 TO 15048--
60.
DOLLY FAST with an exasperated Jack as he WRITES, tailed by
ASSISTANT DEPUTY ROSKO --
JACK
--Rosko, I need you to get every
radio we have and you tune to these
frequencies -- understand?
ROSKO
No. What?
JACK
Hey Danny, you have a radio scanner
with a descrambler don't you?
DANNY
Voice inverter, yeah.
61.
JACK
Whatever, get it down and set it up
for me.
ROSKO
What is this?
JACK
I think the Air Force is using
UNASSIGNED CHANNELS--
He heads for his office, seeing LOUIS, who is being escorted
out by an Officer across the room.
LOUIS
Hey -- he was at my house yesterday
morning, are you aware of that?
OFFICER ROSKO
(quiet to Jack)
We brought him in about the car lot
and other things -- he's clean.
LOUIS
I'd appreciate it if you would
inform your son that my house if
off-limits. And so it my daughter.
Louis heads out -- HOLD ON JACK AS he turns, ENTERS HIS
OFFICE, and as that door opens, we CUT TO:
The door opens of his messy, motherless room. Joe and Alice
enter. He could not be more self-conscious. He moves stacks
of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of
underwear and socks. He closes the closet and hangs a bath
towel on his desk chair. She looks around sa she enters. The
light dim, intimate.
JOE
Oh gawd, I didn't clean up.
Joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to
the floor; NOTEBOOKS AND SCHOOL WORK spill out and we get a
GLIMPSE of some "B-MINUSES" and other "C-PLUSES" in RED.
Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS:
ALICE
-- you made all these?
62.
JOE
Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre
Dame. I watched that one on TV.
HERE---
Alice sits on the bed. Joe takes the FIVE-CAR TRAIN MODEL.
She moves close:
JOE (CONT'D)
This is the train they wanna
destroy.
Alice hold it. Joe watches her. She really looks at it.
ALICE
... it looks real.
(beat, studies)
It looks so old...
JOE
That's dry brush technique.
(off her look)
After you've painted the base
color, you take something like...
(grabs up Testors bottle)
Euro Gray.
Her face is so close to his. Her hair touches his ear.
ALICE
Euro Gray...
JOE
There are so many different grays,
it's crazy. And you pour a little
onto like a paper plate. Then you
take a dry brush and you just dip
it in, then you brush on the paper,
so the paint's barely on the brush.
Then you make small brush strokes
on the model. Little ones, like
where the wear and tear would be.
Around the wheels. Or where the
doors would slide. Then you do it
again, like with Camouflage Gray--
or here, I used Insignia Red to
make it look like there was another
coat of paint on there before. Like
they painted over it, but you could
see it scratched off.
Lost in thought, he looks at her. Suddenly self-conscious.
63.
ALICE
What was that necklace?
(off his awkward stare)
The one you were holding at the
train crash. Was it your mom's?
It takes him a beat. Finally:
JOE
My dad gave it to her the day I was
born. She wears it all the time.
Used to.
(BEAT)
It was bad, how she-- died and
stuff, but they got the necklace
back. So.
Their tension INTERRUPTED BY an out of breath Charles:
CHARLES
Guys, what the hell?! No one knew
where you were.
JOE
We're sitting right here.
CHARLES
You gotta be the soldier.
JOE
I thought you were calling Evan.
CHARLES
Evan blew us off, he's a pussy.
(TO ALICE)
Excuse me.
ALICE
It's okay.
CHARLES
You gotta do it. You're the only
one.
Jack with OFFICER TALLY (24):
JACK
The hell do you mean you "found my
dog in Brookville?" That's a
DIFFERENT COUNTY--
64.
OFFICER TALLY
Lucy-- that's where she is. We've
gotten nearly thirty calls from
people who have found local dogs.
Thing is, the calls coming in
aren't local.
Tally puts a MAP on his desk -- 28 DOTS in a CIRCLE, anywhere
from a 20 to 150 MILE RADIUS, WITH LILLIAN AT THE CENTER.
OFFICER TALLY (CONT'D)
It's like they all just... ran
away, every direction...
Jack is stunned.
Officer Rosko at his desk, with a YOUNG WOMAN, a HAM RADIO at
his desk beside a REEL-TO-REEL TAPE DECK. He takes notes:
YOUNG WOMAN
It's not her. She never's
disappeared before.
OFFICER ROSKO
Alright. Now what does she look
like?
YOUNG WOMAN
She's got dark hair, it was in
rollers. Do you know what rollers
are?
OFFICER ROSKO
Yes, I know what rollers are.
YOUNG WOMAN
She went to her car--
Suddenly a GARBLED ELECTRONIC SOUND from the HAM RADIO. Rosko
quickly hits RECORD on the reel-to-reel --
OFFICER ROSKO
EXCUSE ME--
He grabs speaker, turns the volume knob, puts the speaker
close to the tape recorder, turns on recorder.
65.
FOUR OFFICERS gather as Jack PLAYS BACK THE REEL-TO-REEL
through Milner's DESCRAMBLER. He WRITES DOWN AS THEY LISTEN
TO MEN'S VOICES, creepily FILTERED and BROKEN UP:
MALE VOICE (V.O.) OFFICERS
--zero-niner center opera - (AD LIB)
ocal position-- fangs out. Listen, that's Air Force.
Cop-- confirm, Operation What are they doing
Walking Distance is-- six- transmitting on these
three-niner, retur-- frequencies? Maybe they don't
erations. want anyone to find em? Maybe
they're not Air Force.
ROSKO
What's he say? Operation what?
CLOSE ON--JACK:
JACK
Walking Distance.
A dozen OFFICERS go through HUNDREDS OF CARDBOARD BOXES of
documents. Books and personal belongings are put into boxes,
taken from the house. Overmyer enters, crosses to Nelec, who
reviews a folder.
OVERMYER
Nothing so far--
67.
NELEC
How much more is there?
OVERMYER
Sixty boxes in the basement, maybe
more.
NELEC
What, more tax returns?
OVERMYER
It's here somewhere. If we can't
find it, Woodward'll tell us where
it is.
But Nelec has seen something outside: THE KIDS.
NELEC
... the hell's that?
OVERMYER
... looks like kids making a
movie...
Behind them, a WINDOW, showing the street, where Jack insists
Joe get into the car. Nelec looks out -- sees Jack take Joe
by the arm, grab the tripod and head to his squad car.
Joe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding,
watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again.
Then he looks over at his friends -- Charles giving him a
"WHAT THE FUCK?!" Look. Alice watches him sympathetically.
She mouths to him a guilty, "...is it me...?" And Joe shakes
his head: "No." But we -- and she -- know better.
Door opens. Jack enters, then lets Joe pass him. Joe closes
the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained:
JACK
This is new. All this. For the both
of us. Dealing with-- all this,
just us. So I'm going to make this
as clear and simple as I can:
You're not friends with Alice
Dainard. When I say no, I don't
mean maybe. I don't mean yes. I
mean no. I've known Louis Dainard
for alotta years-- he's been
nothing but trouble. Your mother
used to say he's not a bad guy, he
just needs a chance, he's just sad -
- well I tried to be good to him,
but I can't. Not anymore. I will
not allow him or his daughter in
this house. I will not allow you
spending time with her, doing
projects or whatever it is that
you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope
we're clear.
Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says:
JOE
We're not clear.
Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds --
JACK
What'd you say?
JOE
We're not clear. You and I aren't
clear about anything. We couldn't
be less clear.
JACK
Joseph Francis Lamb--
JOE
(ERUPTING)
Just `cause mom died doesn't mean
you know anything about me!!! You
don't. You don't know about Alice
either -- she's kind!
70.
JACK
I'm not having this discussion with
you--!
JOE
She's NICE to me!
JACK
I don't care what she is! Her
father is a selfish, irresponsible
son-of-a-bitch!
Jack moves CLOSE to Joe -- intimidating -- Joe steps back --
Jack is fucking intense:
JACK (CONT'D)
You listen to me, I've got twelve
thousand people in this town that
are scared out of their minds--
they've got one person they can
rely on -- it used to be someone
else, but now it's just me.
Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying. And
to whom he's saying it. But somehow, in this moment, he can't
be a better father than law officer. Not yet. More upset at
himself than Joe, he heads out.
TIGHT ON NELEC. Past an IV and medical machinery. He's
looking at someone we don't yet see. In the background,
Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet, simple:
NELEC
I don't want any more trouble. Do
you?
Now we see who he's talking to. IT'S DR. WOODWARD. Battered
and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.
NELEC (CONT'D)
We've been going through your
belongings, looking for evidence.
Of what you knew, how you knew
it... and who else might know.
(BEAT)
I remember you. In the lab. And I
recall we didn't see eye to eye,
but that's no excuse for doing what
you did here.
72.
Dr. Woodward swallows. Feels that his time on Earth is coming
to an end no matter what he does here. By the door, Overmyer
is quietly putting on his BLACK GLOVES.
NELEC (CONT'D)
So in the spirit of moving forward
and avoiding more trouble, tell us
where you put your research. I know
you had someone document the crash
that night. Tell me who that was
and I'll help you, I swear to God.
On my mother's life -- if you help
us now, we will take care of you.
DR. WOODWARD
I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,
when you take care of people.
NELEC
--I'm going to bait him. I'm going
to catch him.
DR. WOODWARD
He's in me, you know. As I am in
him. So when you see him next, as
I'm sure you will... I'll be
watching you, too.
Nelec offers a vague, searching smile. But Woodward will not -
- not ever -- relent. So. Nelec moves to the door, he remains
FACING CAMERA, his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the
bed. PUSH IN ON NELEC'S FACE, UNDERSTANDING HIS TRUE NATURE
AS WE CUT TO:
Joe sleeps, power still out. Then, a KNOCK. He wakes up.
Another KNOCK. His window. He moves to it. Opens it. It's
Alice. Joe is half asleep, but also stunned. Very quietly:
ALIE
-- are you-- were you sleeping?
JOE
Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay?
ALICE
Yeah.
JOE
(BEAT)
Oh, you wanna come in?
73.
And Alice climbs in. Joe sits on the floor. Alice does too.
It's odd and silent for a moment.
ALICE
Power's still out.
JOE
Room's still messy.
ALICE
I was in bed, couldn't sleep.
(BEAT)
Thinking. I wanted to tell you
something, before tomorrow -- Don't
let Charles blow up your train.
Joe stares, amazed at her.
ALICE (CONT'D)
I don't think it's right, do you? I
know he's your friend, but he's so
BOSSY--
JOE
He can be sorta li-- I've known him
since Kindergarten, though--
ALICE
He shouldn't always get what he
wants. I mean, who always gets what
they want? -- I know I don't know
you at all. Even though... it sort
of feels like I do.
(BEAT)
Do you not... feel like that?
JOE
-- no, I totally do, I'm just...
sort of in shock at this whole
CONVERSATION--
And the POWER RETURNS -- Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him
-- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT
HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector
to stop it -- but:
ALICE
-- no, keep it-- please --
Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She
watches the film. Can't take her eyes away.
ALICE (CONT'D)
... is that her?
74.
JOE
... yeah...
And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN... as tears start to
fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER:
JOE (CONT'D)
... it's so weird watching her like
this, like she's still here...
(beat, lost in it)
... she used to look at me, this
way... like really look. And I
just... knew I was there. That I
existed.
A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that.
Finally, quietly:
ALICE
He drank that morning. My dad.
(BEAT)
He missed his shift.
(beat, hard)
Your mom took it for him. The day
of the accident.
Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Finally, eyes
wet, Alice turns to Joe.
ALICE (CONT'D)
... I know he wishes it was him.
Instead of her.
(HARD BEAT)
... and sometimes I wish it was,
too.
Joe just stares at her... heartsick and speechless. Finally:
JOE
Don't say that.
(BEAT)
He's your dad.
Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS.
Joe turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS. A sort of
SHUDDER-HUM. Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound
remains. Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE
CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk.
Joe and Alice move to it. He turns on his desk lamp. The cube
VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly.
ALICE JOE
-- has this--? -- no.
75.
Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube
-- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN.
They are amazed. They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the
SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to
touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY -
- ACROSS THE ROOM -- AND BLASTS THROUGH THE WALL, LEAVING A
FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to
the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Joe, his heart pounding. He
moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance,
trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER.
Alice enters the dark house quietly. She steps carefully
toward her room, when --
LOUIS (O.S.)
Morning.
His voice makes her JUMP. She turns: sitting in the dark, in
an armchair, is her father. He's awake. And drunk.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
You wanna tell me where you were?
Or you want me to tell you.
A tense beat, her mind races. Breathe, Alice, just breathe.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
Sit down.
ALICE
I should go to bed.
LOUIS
I wanna talk to you. I said sit
down.
ALICE
I don't want to sit down.
LOUIS
Then go. Be just like your mother
and leave.
This kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
GO AHEAD, GO!
76.
We're with Louis as he drive -- clearly drunk --
Louis is bleeding. Badly hurt. He adjusts himself --
painfully -- then looks into the CRACKED-GLASS REAR VIEW
MIRROR -- AND HE SEES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIS EYES GO WIDE.
77.
THROUGH THE MOSAIC OF THE SHATTERED REAR VIEW MIRROR, WE SEE
THE CREATURE GRAB ALICE -- HER SCREAMS BECOME HER FATHER'S:
LOUIS
-- ALICE, NO!!!!! NO!!!!!!!
Louis tries to get out of the car -- but it's painful -- and
his door is JAMMED SHUT -- he goes for the passenger door --
Joe stands at the counter with Charles, who is in a bad mood.
JOE
(EMPHATIC WHISPER)
That thing went through my wall.
CHARLES
I told you not to pick it up in the
first place.
JOE
What are you so angry about? That
I'm not going to let you blow up my
train?
CHARLES
That's part of it! Juts a part!
Donny's returned with a DEVELOPED FILM ENVELOPE. A red "RUSH"
stamp on it. He gives Charles his change:
DONNY
Tall your sister Donny from Olsen's
broke up with Karen, that shit
ended a week ago.
Charles heads off -- Joe follows.
Charles threads the film into the projector.
CHARLES
That night of the crash, you
started getting all weird.
JOE
-- what?
CHARLES
Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden.
JOE
Your movie was over! That's what
you said! You were upset. I gave
you a camera! I helped you!
CHARLES
Don't pretend like you did it for
me! You didn't do it for me and you
know it!
JOE
What's your problem?
Charles ROLLS THE FILM, DIMS THE LIGHTS --
CHARLES
It was never about me! It was
always about Alice!
And suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there
she is: ALICE, from the night of the train crash. The scene
plays as they filmed it:
MRS. HATHAWAY
John. I don't like it. This case.
These murders.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
What am I supposed to do, go to
Michigan with you?
THE FILMED SCENE CONTINUES as Joe and Charles argue:
JOE
Well, you're the one who wanted the
wife in the movie!
81.
CHARLES
Not so you could fall in love with
her!
Joe's mind spins -- how does he respond to this?!
JOE
What do you even care what I think
about Alice?!
CHARLES
Because I like her! That's why!
That's why I asked her in the first
place! So I could get to know her,
not YOU!
JOE
-- wait, you like Alice Dainard?
CHARLES
You're such an idiot.
JOE
(from Charles' movie)
Guys, look out!
They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but
it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing.
Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the
SETTLING DEBRIS. Charles moves forward, so the film is now
partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM.
CHARLES
SHIT! Look at all that smoke! We
can't use any of this. And you
won't even let me blow up your
train. Everything's bogus.
JOE
We can make another train and blow
that one up.
Joe moves forward. Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too.
JOE (CONT'D)
I do like her. Sorry about that.
CJAR
Shut up. It's okay.
(BEAT)
That's not even what bothers me.
(beat, finally, sad)
It's that she likes you too. That
really bothers me. I dunno...
82.
But Joe has seen something -- on the screen -- SOTTO:
JOE
... Charles...
CHARLES
I know it's stupid. What would she
ever like me? I haven't leaned out
yet, which the doctor says is gonna
HAP--
But Joe has slapped Charles' arm, his eyes locked to the
screen -- Charles looks too -- AND NOW WE SEE IT: through the
BROKEN CAMERA LENS -- SOMETHING MOVES -- SOMETHING BIG --
FROM THE TRAIN CAR, THROUGH THE WRECKAGE -- what the hell is
it? TOO DAMN BIG -- MOSTLY OUT OF FRAME, ITS SHAPE AND FLESH
TOO BIZARRE -- we only see the LEGS as it clears frame --
CHARLES (CONT'D)
-- Joe, what the hell--?!
PUSH IN ON THEIR FACES AS THEY SEE THE ALIEN THEY'VE CAPTURED
ON FILM -- then from outside: AN AIR RAID SIREN RAMPS,
WHINING THROUGH THE TOWN. The boys look at each other --
afraid. QUICK CLOSE-UPS as they REWIND THE FILM AND RIP IT
OUT AND TAKE THE CANNISTER:
Joe and Charles get on, frightened and uncomfortable. They
sit. Outside: the madness of the evac -- they scan the crowd.
JOE CHARLES
You see your family anywhere? -- no, you see your dad?
-- no...
ARMED Air Force and National Guard SOLDIERS direct MASSES OF
PEOPLE, carrying luggage and belongings. Move with Joe and
Charles, who scan for familiar faces -- suddenly Charles'
MOTHER IS THERE -- embraces Charles:
84.
CHARLES' MOTHER
Charles, Charles -- sweetheart, are
you okay? I went back to the house
and you were gone.
CHARLES
They made us get on the bus.
CHARLES' MOTHER
Hi, Joe.
JOE
Hi.
(TO CHARLES)
I'm gonna find my dad.
CHARLES
You gonna tell him about that
thing?
JOE
Yeah.
CHARLES' MOTHER
Come back if you can't find him.
He heads off. ORDERS are being BARKED -- RESIDENTS can be
heard, complaining and arguing. Walkie SQUAWKS and PA
ANNOUNCEMENTS as SOLDIERS check their wrist bands. Joe passes
an ARGUING MAN and SOLDIER:
ARGUING MAN ARGUING SOLDIER
-- I need to go back to my -- sir, the town is sealed
house, I left some medication off -- no one is allowed back
that my wife needs-- -- you can talk to the nurses
-- no, we can't get it here -- the town must stay
anywhere else, I need to go empty until we've been given
back-- the all-clear--
BOOM UP TO REVEAL the EVAC CENTER. A THOUSAND PEOPLE so far.
LOUIS lies in a cot in the TRIAGE UNIT, fifty beds
transferred from the hospital. Louis stares off, head
bandaged, eyes open, MUTTERING TO HIMSELF, like a man as
tired, hung over, injured and in shock as he is.
Find Joe, who is looking everywhere for his dad -- he finally
sees Louis and hurries to him.
85.
JOE
Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb. I know
you don't like me sir, and I'm
sorry about that-- but I'm looking
for my dad--
And Louis GRABS HIS SHIRT and pulls him close. In a voice
desperate and heartsick, he says:
LOUIS
It took her.
JOE
(long beat, sotto)
... what?
LOUIS
It took her. I saw it. It was...
something... so... big, like
nothing -- it was-- and no one...
no one believes me...
(CRYING)
... no one believes me-- they just
keep giving me pills. It took
her... Joe, it took Alice... no one
believes me.
Joe's mind is on fire as he absorbs this -- HE WHISPERS:
JOE
... I believe you.
And Louis looks at him with hope --
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It took Alice.
CUT TO JOE WITH HIS FRIENDS, assembled around a set of cots.
CHARLES CARY
That thing took her--?! -- are you shitting me?
JOE (CONT'D)
Guys, WE HAVE TO GO BACK.
They look at him like he's from Uranus.
CHARLES PRESTON
Back where? To do what?
JOE (CONT'D)
Back to town -- to find Alice -- we
have to find her--
86.
MARTIN JOE
She's dead, if it took her,
she-- -- don't say that!
PRESTON
Wait a minute -- first of all, I
want to live. Okay?
JOE
I'm going whether you come or not--
which I really hope you do.
CARY
(pats his backpack)
I've got six tons of explosives in
here, let's find that thing and
blow it to shit.
Jen, Charles' hot sister, lies on her cot making her Columbia
House Records choices. Charles is in her face.
JEN
As if I'm gonna help you.
CHARLES
Do this for me and I'll babysit the
twins next week so you can go to
Wendy's stupid party.
Jen suddenly closes her magazine, stares at him suspiciously.
CHARLES (CONT'D)
I am not shitting you. You can't
ask me any questions though. You
can't tell anyone. I'm serious. No
one.
JEN
... does it have to be him?
CHARLES
Yes or no, you ugly freak. I'm
about to rescind the offer.
Jen looks RIGHT AS US, vulnerable, but seductive:
87.
JEN
This whole evacuation thing's
freaking me out. Making me rethink
my priorities. Saw you over here
and thought maybe we could kick
back.
Now we see Donny, looking RIGHT AT US. Utterly stunned.
DONNY
-- we totally could.
JEN
I asked Charles about you, and he
said you're a great guy--
DONNY
I totally am.
JEN
Will you hate me if I start our
relationship by asking a favor?
A small, tiled room, no windows. Jack, up all night and
pissed off, but bored being pissed off, POUNDS ON THE DOOR:
JACK
Hey! I gotta take a leak! What am I
supposed to do, piss in here?!
A beat. He POUNDS again. The door finally unlocks and opens.
A 32-year-old humorless, armed SOLDIER stands there.
JACK (CONT'D)
Thanks for the hospitality.
Jack is led down a dilapidated, narrow hall. Soldier with the
semi-auto behind him, aimed at his back. As Jack passes an
open door, he spies an empty office -- through the window on
the tarmac are a few MILITARY VEHICLES, a handful of airmen.
Jack's mind races as he approaches the bathroom at the end of
the hall -- Jack turns:
JACK
So am I going in alone or are y--?
-- AND MID-SENTENCE, JACK GRABS THE GUN, PULLS THE SOLDIER
AND SLAMS HIM HARD IN THE THROAT! THE STUNNED SOLDIER GETS
SLAM-FLATTENED BY JACK, who KNEELS to him. PUSH IN CLOSE --
his eyes wide, mind racing -- WHAT THE HELL NEXT? CUT TO:
89.
BEHIND A SOLDIER as he RUNS through the dark building -- oh
shit -- he comes to a stop, back against the wall -- but PUSH
IN on his face: IT'S JACK, IN AN AIR FORCE UNIFORM. He is
fucking scared; at least he's holding a rifle. He peels
around a corner -- through a window, the tarmac: GUARDS,
VEHICLES. Jack's eyes shift -- he spots an AIRCRAFT FUEL
TANK. Eyes wild -- A METALLIC CLI-CHUNK AS HE UNSAFETIES THE
RIFLE --
Jack behind the wheel, he blasts the vehicle through the
exit, along the road back to town --
Donny drives, Joe shotgun. Charles, Cary and Martin in back.
MARTIN
Well, so guys, if the Air Force has
already searches Woodward's house,
wouldn't they've already searched
the classroom too?
CARY
Hay Donny, this car is gnarly.
90.
CHARLES
I was thinking about that too.
JOE
Maybe the classroom, but not the
dungeon.
CHARLES
Yeah, Woodward has all kinds of
weird stuff in the dungeon.
MARTIN
Where's the dungeon?
DONNY
Shut up. What kind of music does
she like? Your sister.
CHARLES
I don't care. Disco I guess?
DONNY
I could get back into disco.
JOE
We shouldn't take River Road, they
had a roadblock.
DONNY
Dork. I saw it. Observe.
Donny YANKS the steering wheel -- he turns onto a DIRT ROAD --
the car RUMBLES away from camera --
The boys -- with FLASHLIGHTS -- turn a corner -- hurry down
the hall --
CHARLES
I cannot believe we're breaking
into school, who does that? No one
does that-- idiots do that--
The boys BREAK A CLASSROOM DOOR WINDOW and enter.
We're looking down at the boys, SURROUNDED by hundreds of
documents, boxes, photographs, 16MM film cannisters and
cassette tapes. Charles threads the film.
JOE
Dr. Woodward was dishonorably
discharged from Nellis Air Base in
1963 because of "subversive
conduct," whatever that is.
92.
Joe holds up a 20-year-old PHOTO of MEN IN A LAB. Among them
is 50-year-old WOODWARD:
MARIN
Dude, check it out. Old Man
Woodward.
CHARLES
Back when he was like Middle-Aged
Man Woodward.
MARTIN
-- He's been tracking this thing
since like 1958.
JOE
(to the movie)
What is this?
CHARLES
I don't know. It says April 8th,
1963 incident. I dunno.
JOE
Cary, we got to find this thing.
CARY
Sorry.
Cary puts a CASSETTE into a tape deck, hits PLAY:
DR. WOODWARD (V.O.) JOE
-- I told them this creature
is more sophisticated than
any of us. That his species -- that's him --
IS PREDOMINANTLY
subterranean. He's being -- subterranean --
treated without compassion or
respect....
VARIOUS SHOTS of PHOTOGRAPHS AND DOCUMENTS: "UFO CRASH,"
"MAJOR NELEC IN CHARGE OF OPERATIONS," "TWO ALIEN BODIES, ONE
LIVING," "RESTRAINTS USED," "EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED" -- as
Charles threads a FILM:
The FILM: an AIR FORCE LOGO pops on and off. We see inside a
HANGAR, where dozens of SCIENTISTS examine LARGE, BUS-SIZED
pieces of jagged and unearthly material. All the while:
DR. WOODWARD (V.O.)
-- I explained that all he wants is
to rebuild his ship.
(MORE)
93.
DR. WOODWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
A craft made up of those cubes of a
complex, shape-shifting element--
remarkable material that we'll
never fully understand. He has been
desperate to reconstitute his ship
since it crashed here in `58, but
instead of giving him the help he
needs, we've held him as a
prisoner. He's been restrained and
experimented upon -- Through pain
and lack of compassion, we have
taught him to hate us all. We've
turned him into an enemy.
Scientist explaining something to a group of SENIOR OFFICERS.
Among them, a 32-year-old NELEC.
Film JUMP CUTS to a HUGE REINFORCED LAB CAGE. Inside, sitting
almost in a ball, IS THE MASSIVE CREATURE. Hard to see here.
Another JUMP CUT as a SOLDIER offers a bucket of FOOD to the
alien -- IT'S WOODWARD.
CARY
Guys, it's Dr. Woodward. Look.
Woodward offers what looks like RAW MEAT to the motionless,
sitting CREATURE. All the boys watch quietly -- then,
suddenly, in milliseconds, the creature is UP, GRABBING
WOODWARD THROUGH THE BARS -- the boys JUMP --
CHARLES MARTIN
Arh! I can't watch that!
DR. WOODWARD (V.O.)
I told them I knew these things
because he made contact with me.
That he makes a psychic connection
by touch. The moment we made
contact, I understood him and he,
me. What I know is that if we don't
change this and start helping him,
we will all pay the price. But
Nelec won't listen--
The boys are SCARED as they watch the creature HOLD WOODWARD
TIGHT -- LIFT HIM -- and its TENTACLES suddenly THRUST into
his NOSE, EARS and MOUTH --
Joe stands and looks intently at the screen.
JOE
Woodward wasn't trying to kill it.
94.
CHARLES
He was trying to help it escape.
Just then a MUFFLED SHATTER-CRASH --
MARTIN
Did you hear that?
Suddenly BOOM! The doors BURST OPEN and ARMED COMMANDOS,
NIGHT VISION GOGGLES OBSCURING THEIR FACES, AIMING SEMI-AUTO
WEAPONS AT THE BOYS WHO SCREAM --
CHARLES COMMANDO
DON'T KILL US! PLEASE DON'T (calls on radio)
KILL US!!! PLEASE DON'T KILL -- we've got civilians --
US!!! minors-- four of `em.
Donny gets stoned in his car. Doesn't notice the MOVEMENT in
the distance behind him. The MILITARY coming in.
The locker hallway: the Boys are HANDCUFFED AND SCARED, being
led out by ARMED SOLDIERS. Nelec moves to them. QUIETLY:
CHARLES
-- oh shit!
NELEC
Search them.
Overmyer CHECKS THEIR POCKETS as Nelec TAKES CARY'S BACKPACK,
opens it -- pulls out some FIREWORKS. Proudly:
CARY
I rolled those M-80's myself,
that's right.
NELEC
(eyes flick to Joe)
You're the Deputy's boy.
Joe's terrified as Overmyer pulls from Joe's pocket a couple
COINS, half a pack of Bubble Yum and HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE.
Drops everything but the necklace. Joe reacts, panicked --
JOE
-- hey, no--
95.
NELEC
(TO OVERMYER)
Move out.
Joe's on the verge of tears as Overmyer POCKETS the necklace.
Off the TERRIFIED BOYS as they're ushered away --
Jack moves fast through the crowded evac area --
SOLDIER
Staff Sergeant.
JACK
Hi, how are you doing?
YOUNG KID
Hi, Mr. Lamb.
JACK
Shhhh.
Jack moves to Officer Rosko, who reacts to seeing him dressed
this way --
JACK (CONT'D)
Rosko!
OFFICER ROSKO
Where the hell you been? What are
YOU WEARING--
96.
JACK
--come here. The Air Force set that
fire, they want the town empty for
some reason. The whole military
operation, the evacuation,
everything is all bad.
OFFICER ROSKO
Did you hear about Joe? Dispatch
just got a call on citizen's band:
Joe and some friends were grabbed
by military personnel at the middle
school.
Off Jack's REACTION --
Preston reads ISAAC ASIMOV'S SCIENCE FICTION MAGAZINE --
suddenly Jack is there, grabs him and pulls him up:
JACK
Tell me everything, right now, and
I won't throw you in jail.
PRESTON
-- yessir --
(holds the SUPER 8 FILM)
But you should look at this first.
ANGLE ON THE DRIVER as a RADIO CALL come in:
VOICE (V.O.)
(FILTERED)
Base Fortress requests ETA.
Nelec arrives, grabs the radio mike:
NEWS REPORTER
Chief Master Sergeant, Dustoff-03
is twenty minutes out.
VOICE (V.O.)
Roger.
97.
PAN as Nelec moves back -- we PUSH IN on OVERMYER, who sits
near the front, putting on his DARK GLOVES. Nelec sits, which
takes us to a shot towards the back of the bus -- another
Airman, HERNANDEZ, 40, sits too. PUSH PAST THEM toward our
four BOYS, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty,
wired SAFETY GLASS, all looking toward us, terrified.
CHARLES
... what... what's gonna happen?
CARY
I think we're gonna die.
MARTIN
No. They'd never do that.
JOE
-- guys-- I forced you to come with
me... I'm... I'm so sorry.
(looks to Charles)
I'm so sorry...
CARY
I think they're gonna kill us.
CHARLES
(UNCONVINCING)
Joe. They're not gonna kill us. You
know why?
Joe is suddenly hopeful:
JOE
... why--?
But just as he's spoken, a SHAPE FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND HIM
SLAMS HARD INTO THE BUS, SPIDER-WEBBING THE BULLETPROOF
GLASS! The ENTIRE BUS IS ROCKED, Charles SCREAMS, hurt --
At the front of the bus, NELEC FALLS -- HITS A BENCH, THEN
CRASHES INTO THE SIDE WINDOW --
The MILITARY DRIVER struggles with the wheel --
98.
DRIVER
-- HOLD ON. HOLD ON--!!!
CHARLES
Was that the thing from the train?!
The kids panic as the HOBBLED BUS STILL DRIVES --
CHARLES
Was that it?! Oh my God!!!
MARTIN
I can't see anything -- do you see
anything?
JIE
-- not yet --!
DRIVER
-- Sir, I gotta pull over!
Charles looks forward --
CHARLES
Oh my God, guys --
Joe turns to see NELEC LOADING A RIFLE, straining to see out
a driver's side window. Mayhem:
CHARLES (CONT'D)
What's that gun --?
Cary, behind him, actually answers him:
99.
CARY CHARLES
Sako Bolt Action, 30-06
(pronounced: thirty-aut-six) -- okay okay okay, I get it --
Leathwood Art Scope--
Hernandez makes a radio call, Overmyer straining to see out
the windows as Nelec locks and loads the unique ammo and
moves to a driver's side window, tries to see --
HERNANDEZ OVERMYER
-- repeat, contact with
precious cargo, thirty clicks -- sir, I do not have visual -
from center of town, - Driver, can you see
currently headed for Base anything?
FORTRESS --
HERNANDEZ DRIVER
-- send support immediately! No sir, nothing!
Despite his handcuffs, Charles desperately tries to unlatch
his seatbelt with his shaking hands -- Cary sees this:
CARY
Charles, what are you doing?
CHARLES
I don't feel good about this --
PUSH IN on Cary, to CLOSEUP, looking PAST CAMERA, TERRIFIED --
CARY
-- oh God -- guys --
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM THE DARK
LIKE A GHOST THROUGH BLACK VELVET -- HIT BY THE HEADLIGHTS,
IT ROARS AT SUCH A PITCH AND VOLUME THAT THE WINDSHIELD
SPIDERS! It's out of the light and gone again -- PUSH IN ON
NELEC -- newly terrified, he hands his TRACKING RIFLE to
OVERMYER:
NELEC
Here. Tag it.
Overmyer is stunned for a moment, but hides it well:
OVERMYER
Yessir.
NELEC
Open the door.
Reluctant as hell, for a tense beat, the Driver pulls the
controls: the door HISSES LOUDLY as it opens.
100.
In the back, the boys are all frozen for a moment, watching.
Overmyer moves for the door. Five feet away from the door, he
stops, turns back to Nelec:
OVERMYER
Is there anywhere in particul--
KKKKRRRRRASSHHH!!!! THE THING REACHES IN -- SHATTERS THE DOOR
-- the Driver SCREAMS -- the thing GRABS OVERMYER, who DROPS
THE RIFLE -- IT FIRES -- the projectile HITS THE SAFETY GLASS
IN FRONT OF THE BOYS AS OVERMYER, GRABBED, BLOOD IN HIS
MOUTH, TRIES TO HOLD ONTO THE SEATS, REACHING FOR NELEC, WHO
DOES NOTHING -- OVERMYER IS VIOLENTLY YANKED OUT OF THE BUS --
Joe IN SHOCK -- Behind him, Martin VOMITS.
NELEC
GET US OUT OF HERE, NOW! NOW!!!
(TO HERNANDEZ)
What kind of firepower do we have?
CHARLES SCRAMBLES to unlatch his seatbelt --
JOE
Charles! Maybe you should wait!
CHARLES
FOR WHAT?! ANOTHER MONSTER?!?!
BAAAM!!! The bus is SLAMMED SO HARD --
Windows SHATTER -- Charles and Cary -- seatbelts removed --
LAND ON JOE AND MARTIN! The THREE SOLDIERS hit the window-
floor painfully -- Hernandez so hard he's INSTANTLY
UNCONSCIOUS! THE BUS IS NOW MOTIONLESS ON ITS SIDE, OPEN DOOR
UP. Nelec rises. Scared, but pissed.
The REAR WHEELS of the bus SCREAM in rotation -- we
COUNTERMOVE with the creature as it COMES AROUND the other
side, CLIMBS onto the exposed side -- METAL AND WINDOW
CRUNCHES --
The boys gather their wits -- LIGHTS FLASHING HAUNTINGLY --
101.
JOE
-- you guys okay?!
CHARLES
-- I wanna go home so bad --
Joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door -- tries the
handle -- but it's never gonna open.
On the OTHER side of the glass, Nelec rights himself,
momentarily disoriented -- breathing heavily, he moves away
from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the
kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either.
And there is Joe and Nelec, face-to-face -- Joe seeing the
fear in Nelec's eyes -- his understanding that this is his
fate. Somehow Nelec takes this moment to look into Joe's face
-- to silently -- in a look -- repent. Instantly, Joe knows
he's about to watch this man's life end.
SMASH! Nelec turns -- the creature is BUSTING the bus door --
SMASHING AT IT -- to make it BIGGER. So it can get inside.
The Driver's LEG IS CAUGHT -- he's trying to get out, but
cannot -- is PANICKING -- as SSSSTAB!!! The creature KILLS
HIM INSTANTLY and SMASH as again it tries to WIDEN the door.
Nelec WINCES -- the only conscious man on this side of the
glass; the boys COWER on their side, with each monstrous hit,
all their eyes on Nelec -- except Joe, who only wants to get
to Alice. He sees the SHATTERED BULLETPROOF WINDOW -- above
them, on what has become the "roof" of the bus.
JOE
Up there, there's broken glass --
MARTIN
-- here, use me, I'm strong!
JOE
Lemme get on your shoulders!
CHARLES
I'm strong!
The boys struggle to get Joe onto Martin's shoulders as, on
the other side of the glass, Nelec scrambles for Hernandez's
fallen SEMI-AUTO RIFLE. He grabs it and scampers back to the
glass as SMASH!!! Pieces of metal and glass BURST like ice
chips as the creature violently WIDENS the bus door opening--
On Charles' shoulders, Joe can reach the shattered-but-thick
window -- which he must HIT -- BREAK OPEN to get out --
essentially exactly what the creature is doing, in reverse.
Using both fists, Joe POUNDS the window. No give.
102.
MARTIN CARY
Harder! Come on, you PUSSY!!!
With all his might, Joe hits the window again -- the
SLIGHTEST sound of glass adjusting -- meanwhile, SLAM!!! The
creature BUSTING the bus door -- PRYING it wider like a
sardine can -- NELEC SITS AGAINST THE GLASS AND OPENS FIRE,
FUTILELY, ON THE CREATURE. He makes a CALL on his walkie:
NELEC
This is Nelec -- use the big guns.
Whatever happens to me, you take it
down, you kill him --
-- and he drops the walkie and FIRES AGAIN -- the LOUD
GUNFIRE BARELY AUDIBLE behind the glass with the boys as Joe
hits the glass again -- BAM -- a CRINKLING of glass --
CHARLES
You can do it!
Joe hits again -- so does the creature -- as Nelec RUNS OUT
OF AMMO. That was never really hope anyway. Joe hits again
and CRASH! The window SHATTERS! Glass chunks RAIN DOWN on the
boys -- all covering their face -- Cary seeing the CREATURE
STARTING TO ENTER THE BUS --
CARY
Go! Joe, move!!!
With all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up -- outside
the bus, Joe peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back to
Joe -- just fifteen feet away, focused on the door -- and Joe
strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus.
And as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in -- first
Joe, then Charles (AD LIB DIALOGUE WITH CARY AND MARTIN: "You
gotta lose some weight --" "I know!!!"), Then Cary, and
Martin last -- they all jump down to the dirt -- they hear
SCREAMS and turn back for a moment --
Inside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE
TIGHT-FITTING BUS, SMASHING BENCHES, MAKING ITS WAY
TERRIFYINGLY DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD HIM. And as the creature
descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge --
Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified:
NELEC
-- it was my turn once... to find
you. Now... it's your t--
103.
Before he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it
would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON
THE BULLETPROOF GLASS -- WHICH OUR CAMERA IS SAFELY BEHIND --
OBSCURING THE NIGHTMARISH VIEW.
In the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER
and SHAKE. Then... silence. They see the creature burst out
of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy, away from
them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter. Which, of
course, is partly what it is. They're sort of stunned.
CHARLES
I just sharteezed a little.
Louis stares off, lost. Two AIR FORCE SOLDIERS arrive:
SOLDIER
You need to come with us, we have
some questions for you --
LOUIS
-- what, is she... Is she dead--?
SOLDIER TWO
Just come with us.
Standing is hard for heartsick Louis, his legs so hurt --
suddenly JACK IS THERE, acting the role of Air Force:
JACK
Hey fellas, I've got orders from
Colonel Nelec to personally
transport this man to base.
SOLDIER
He's all yours, Staff Sergeant.
As the two Soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his
shoulders, heads off in the other direction, as Louis looks
him over, confused:
LOUIS
Where're we going--?
JACK
-- to find our kids.
On LOUIS' FACE -- a surprised glimmer of HOPE --
104.
Joe drives, Donny is ASLEEP. Other boys in the back.
105.
CHARLES
Joe, where are we going?
JOE
I saw something at the cemetery.
Woodward said it's subterranean-- I
think I know where it--
CARY
What's that? What are those sounds?
MARTIN
Guys, that sounds like guns!
CARY
(points to a tank)
What the hell is that?!
SUDDENLY, BOOM!!! A DEAFENING, CONCUSSIVE GUNBLAST! They're
LIT UP by what they see ahead: in the oncoming cross-street,
TANKS -- TWO OF THEM -- AND A ROCKET-LAUNCHING VEHICLE FIRE
AGAIN AND AGAIN AT SOMETHING WE CAN'T YET SEE! The boys COVER
THEIR EARS -- Donny awakens, but only for a moment --
CHARLES
TURN THE CAR AROUND!
Joe quickly turns left into a driveway -- but we PUSH IN
TIGHT ON HIM -- from the direction they just came are MORE
TANKS AND MILITARY VEHICLES -- Joe's eyes go wide -- they're
stuck. GUNFIRE CONTINUES!
JOE
We gotta go by foot--!
CHARLES
Where?!
JOE
Just follow me!
(nudges Donny hard))
Donny! Hey! Donny, wake up!
(Donny half looks at him)
We have to get out of here!
CARY
He's too stoned!
MARTIN
Drugs are so bad!
Joe and the boys get out of the car fast and RUN across the
street, zig-zagging between the enormous MILITARY VEHICLES --
106.
-- they run in for cover -- they're silhouetted in this dark
space by the EXPLOSION LIGHT emanating from the windows.
They're all out of breath in a strange KITCHEN --
CARY
You guys see those explosions? They
were huge.
MARTIN
-- whose house is this?
CARY
(he hands him a picture)
Kathy's. I got it off the fridge.
MARTIN
Kathy? Oh, Kathy's cool.
Another CRAZY LOUD AND BRIGHT EXPLOSION -- the light fixtures
sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter.
MARTIN (CONT'D) CHARLES
Charles-- that's not yours-- -- what?! I'm thirsty and I'm
in a war zone!
Another fucking LOUD BLAST -- sound of GLASS BREAKING -- and
the creature ROARING --
107.
And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window --
Joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts:
JOE
Come on, guys, let's go. Come on!
Joe runs -- the others follow --
CARY
Where we going?
JOE
To the cemetery--
But as they get to the living room a HUGE EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT
A WALL! They all go down -- but Martin is in agony all of a
sudden -- his leg RIPPED by concrete. If there's good news
here, the creature has left this area -- the explosions
getting further away. But there's blood and Martin is in real
pain.
MARTIN
What happened to my leg? It hurts.
CHARLES
Oh shit, Martin, you gotta bone
sticking out of your leg!
CARY
There's a hole in the house!
CHARLES
Joe, gimme that thing on the
curtains!
Charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on
the wall that now has a HOLE in it; MILITARY VEHICLES can be
seen driving past outside. Joe hands Charles the thick fabric
tie -- which Charles fashion into a tourniquet, wraps it
around Martin's leg, tight --
JOE
I'm gonna go find Alice-- you have
to stay with Martin.
Charles looks at Martin -- can't argue. Says, sincerely:
CHARLES
... you gonna be okay without me?
JOE
(a meaningful beat)
... yeah.
108.
Charles nods -- Joe looks to Cary:
CARY
I'm not staying with the girls!
CHARLES
God, Cary. Shut up!
CARY
Calm down.
MARTIN
Oh, my leg hurts!
JOE
Come on, Cary, we gotta go.
Joe nods, determined, and he and Cary head off --
CHARLES
This is going to hurt.
Martin screams.
CHARLES (CONT'D)
I haven't even done it yet.
Joe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood,
many houses shattered, some cars obliterated. The only lone
figures in town.
They're out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows
CAKED WITH DIRT. Stuck. The SECOND door. Dirt-caked windows.
Stuck. The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked.
JOE
Help me!
CARY
Help you with what?
JOE
We need to get inside.
CARY
For what? What's in these windows?
JOE
Cary, help me.
CARY
It's dirt. Why is there dirt in
these windows?
JOE
Help me, on three.
JOE/CARY
One, two, three.... One, two,
three.... One, two threee.
The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one --
two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS
OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness
they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN
FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been
DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED,
caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their
breath.
CARY
Whoa. This is scary.
JOE
You got any sparklers in there?
CARY
Are you kidding me?
Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER.
LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far
enough to tell them it's too far to jump.
110.
But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it
lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom.
JOE
-- Alice is down there.
Jack drives fast. Louis sits beside him. It's awkward. But
not angry. Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad:
LOUIS
I came to your house that day. To
tell you that I never meant to hurt
anyone. Swear to God.
(beat, respectful tears)
I'm sorry, Jack. About what
happened to your wife.
Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road. A
beat. Finally:
JACK
... It was an accident. It was an
accident.
Jack glances at him. A small nod of forgiveness and
gratitude. Louis wants to cry again, but just accepts it.
Joe begins CLIMBING DOWN the ROPE.
Joe lands on the bottom. Dark as hell -- looks up -- at Cary
climbing down into the hole -- the barn roof looming above
him. Now Cry lands too. There are THREE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GO.
Joe's mind races about which way to go.
CARY
Joe, I don't understand--
We HEAR a DISTANT RUMBLING -- like something far off, but
MECHANICAL. Then:
111.
JOE
Shhh. This way.
They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL
TUNNEL, TWENTY FEET TALL --
We're SO FAR AWAY, that the screen is mostly black, with a
small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT.
They come to an area LITTERED WITH THE STUFF OF A LIVING
ROOM. They look up: ANOTHER HOLE LEADING DOWN, DUG STRAIGHT
THROUGH A HOUSE. They continue, coming to an INTERSECTION --
where a NEW TUNNEL branches off.
There's DIM LIGHT from up ahead, where the tunnel BENDS. The
RUMBLING/MECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now. Joe and Cary slowly
move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and
amazes them all at once.
IT'S A HUNDRED-FOOT DIAMETER, FORTY-FOOT TALL UNDERGROUND
SPACE, FILLED WITH A MECHANICAL MARVEL -- A MASSIVE, BIZARRE
CONTRAPTION COMBINING THOUSANDS OF MECHANICAL PIECES, FROM
THE MISSING MICROWAVES, CAR ENGINES, ANTENNAS, AND COUNTLESS
OTHER DEVICES -- WIRES AND CABLES HANG AND CONNECT
EVERYWHERE, ALL LEADING TO THE DIRT CEILING, HEADING UP, TO
SOMEWHERE ABOVE GROUND. THE THICK-WITH-FUMES SPACE CHUGS AND
HUMS WITH A SLOWLY INCREASING PITCH, AS IT IT'S WARMING UP,
GETTING READY TO FINALLY, ACTUALLY WORK.
They cross to the other side. Cary bumps into a HANGING
SHERIFF PRUITT. Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand
on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt.
CARY
It's Sheriff Pruitt.
JOE
I know. Cary look.
Makeshift HANGING BULBS provide some light; a number of other
TUNNELS are visible from here, too. Joe and Cary look at the
space in disbelief.
CARY
What is this?
JOE
We're under the water tower.
112.
Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Cary's shirt.
Cary looks: THROUGH THE MASS OF METAL AND MACHINERY AND
DANGLING CABLES, AT THE OTHER END OF THIS UNDERGROUND
EXPERIMENT, IS THE CREATURE. HUNCHED OVER. BACK TO THE BOYS.
AND IT'S SAVAGELY EATING SOMETHING. IT MOVES A BIT: WE SEE
IT'S A HUMAN LEG. Joe and Cary would SCREAM if they didn't
need to stay quiet. In a panicked WHISPER:
CARY
It's eating a person.
Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other
side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an INSET
section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING
LIFELESS FROM THEIR FEET, WRAPPED IN SOME KIND OF THIN
SHELLAC. TIGHT ON JOE as he sees, among them, ALICE. His
heart POUNDS, his resolve quadruples. Cary sees her too --
JOE
She's here. We're going to use your
firecrackers.
CARY
I don't think it's going to hurt
it, Joe.
JOE
There are other tunnels.
CARY
So?
JOE
I need you to make noise. Lots of
it, right here, in two minutes.
Make it loud and make it last--
gimme some sparklers.
CARY
(goes through his bag)
-- why-- what are you gonna do--?
JOE
(takes SPARKLERS and a
LIGHTER from Cary)
Make sure you're gone by the time
it blows: you can't be here, you
gotta run.
CARY
Where are you going?
113.
But Joe's already gone. Stay with Cary, who opens his
backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of EXPLOSIVES,
glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view --
MOVE FAST with Joe as he races, a LIT SPARKLER giving him his
light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now. Joe runs,
looking for another way into the creature's massive space --
he finally finds another INTERSECTION -- he turns into it --
he disappears down the tunnel --
Cary's made a long, insane pile of FIRECRACKERS -- he uses an
OPEN M-80 and begins laying a SQUIGGLY, LONG LINE OF GUN
POWDER back, away from the firecrackers -- away from the
entrance to the creature's CONTRAPTION space.
Joe races down the dirt tunnel, the SOUND OF THE MECHANICAL
RUMBLING -- and its INCREASING PITCH -- getting LOUDER. The
SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE, who slows --
peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER
SIDE of the space. He sees the creature -- then looks across
to the lifeless body of Alice. His heart sinks.
Cary's done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his
lighter -- FFFT! FFFT! The damn thing won't light --
CARY
-- come on-- damnit!
FFT! FFT! No go -- he keeps trying.
Joe watches as the creature FINISHES WITH ITS MEAL AND HEADS
FOR THE OTHER HANGING BODIES -- PUSH IN ON JOE, DESPERATE --
JOE
-- Cary, come on, come on--
114.
Cary frantically trying the lighter -- FFT! FFT! FFT!
CARY
-- damnit!!!
He looks up -- watches the creature GRAB AND PULL ALICE'S
LIFELESS BODY DOWN FROM HER HANGING POSITION -- it moves with
her to where he was eating the teacher -- Cary SHAKES THE
LIGHTER, STARTING TO CRY AND HE FLICKS IT AND FFFFFTH!!! IT
LIGHTS! HE TOUCHES IT ON THE GUN POWDER AND RUNS OFF --
The creature PULLS AWAY the fibrous covering over Alice --
its TENTACLES SLITHER OUT.
Watching this is horror, Joe's about to run in just as
BABABABABABABABAM!!! The creature JERKS UP from its almost-
meal of Alice, looks toward the EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS, then LEAVES
HER, quickly moving for the tunnel --
The creature arrives in the SMOKE-FILLED TUNNEL, as the
FIREWORKS FILL the tunnel with BRIGHT, MULTI-COLORED LIGHTS --
Joe SPRINTS in, gets to Alice -- lightly slaps her face --
JOE
-- Alice, please -- please --
(nothing -- SLAP)
Alice, wake up!
Nothing -- so he fucking SLAPS HER FACE HARD and she suddenly
INHALES SHARPLY, he eyes WIDE, terrified --
JOE (CONT'D)
Alice! You're alive! Can you hear
me? Are you okay?!
She's CATCHING HER BREATH, nodding, looking at him, amazed --
115.
ALICE
What is this? What are you doing
here?!
JOE
I'm just-- doing the best I can to
save you.
She GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful --
during which -- quietly:
ALICE
How did you know?
JOE
Your dad. He told me. He was
worried. And flipping out.
ALICE
Really?
JOE
-- we need to move--
But she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense:
TINA (O.S.)
Excuse me?
TINA, a 24-year-old , disoriented woman with curlers in her
hair, wakes up.
TINA (CONT'D)
Where are we?
Joe and Alice have helped down one FAMILIAR FACE: SHERIFF
PRUITT. They're out of breath, but their survival instinct
has kicked in:
TINA
I left my bag in my car. Then I
went to my car to get my bag--
ALICE
It's been experimented on for
years. It's terrified and exhausted
and hungry, it just wants to go
home. When it touched me, I knew --
116.
JOE
Alice, help me get the sheriff
down.
TIME CUT:
SHERIFF PRUITT
Follow me. I can get us out of
here.
JOE
Sheriff, we came that way.
SHERIFF PRUITT
Don't argue with me.
TINA
Come on, kids, let's go with the
sheriff.
Joe and Alice follow. They run into a tunnel. We PUSH IN ON
THE MECHANICAL DEVICE -- the PITCH INCREASING MORE NOW -- AS
IF IT'S ABOUT TO "FUNCTION" -- The creature returns and sees
that the humans are gone. He takes off.
Sparkler lighting the way, we're with Joe and Alice -- Pruitt
and Tina behind them:
JOE
Sheriff, I really think we're going
the wrong way.
PRUITT
We'll talk about it when we get up
top.
They continue following Pruitt.
CARY (O.S.)
Joe!
JOE
I told you to get out!
CARY
I thought this was the way out. I
tried! Hey, Alice, welcome back--
PRUITT
Kids, come on, we gotta go.
117.
BUT HE'S LOOKING BACK AND HIS SPARKLER ILLUMINATES THE
CREATURE THAT IS RIGHT UP AHEAD AND TINA SCREAMS -- THEY ALL
DO AS PRUITT TURNS AND IS TAKEN, LIFTED HIGH, KILLED IN THE
DARK AS THEY ALL TURN AND RUN -- PRUITT'S HORRIBLE SCREAMS
terrifying as the foursome sprint in the opposite direction!
After RUNNING HARD for a beat:
They haul ass, but after a long moment TINA IS GRABBED AWAY
INTO THE DARKNESS!!! HER SCREAMS CONTINUE behind them --
They run and run and run, but then BOOM: they hit a DEAD END.
A DIRT WALL. No more tunnels. No options. Out of breath, they
turn -- but dare not go back toward the horrifying blackness.
The only SOUND the sparkler, their erratic breathing and the
DISTANT INCREASING PITCH OF THE CREATURE'S MECHANICAL DEVICE.
THE CREATURE IS THERE -- FORTY FEET FROM THEM, --
APPROACHING! ALICE SCREAMS -- SHE AND CARY MORE BACK AGAINST
THE WALL -- AND THE CREATURE MOVES FOR THEM, BUT JOE YELLS AS
THE THING PASSES THE FIREWORKS:
JOE
GO! YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE, GO!
CARY
Joe, what are you doing?
IT KEEPS COMING -- PAST THE FIREWORKS, AMAZINGLY BACKLIT AS
IT LUMBERS TOWARD JOE, DESPERATELY TRYING TO STAND GROUND:
JOE
WE UNDERSTAND! WE KNOW HOW HARD
IT'S BEEN! BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
HORRIBLE!
CARY
Joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!
JOE
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY NOW!
AND IT GRABS JOE AND LIFTS HIM -- Alice and Cary SCREAM AS
JOE IS BEING SQUEEZED -- HE LOOKS INTO THE GLOSSY BLACK EYES
OF THIS BEAST, WHICH COULD KILL HIM AT ANY TIME -- but in
this moment of fear comes something else. Simple truth -- he
WHISPERS, SHAKILY:
JOE (CONT'D)
-- I know bad things happen-- bad
things happen, but you can still
live. You can still live, you can
still live, you're gonna be okay--
118.
JUST AS WE THINK THE CREATURE'S GONNA KILL HIM: A DISTANT
MECHANICAL TONE -- THE CREATURE TURNS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
SOUND -- THEN TO JOE AGAIN. IT CONSIDERS HIM. ITS EYES'
COVERING PEELS AWAY -- REVEALING HUGE, WET, VULNERABLE EYES.
AND THE THING LOOKS AT HIM. REALLY LOOKS AT HIM. In a way, as
you imagine his mother once had. And Joe feels this too. AND
AFTER A LONG, SCARY BEAT, THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN. Joe
backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY. JOE IS
STUNNED. SHOCKED RELIEF. ALICE AND CARY, TOO --
CARY
Okay, wait a minute, WHAT?!
Then, over the HIGH-PITCHED MECHANICAL SOUND comes RUMBLINGS -
- like THUNDER from above -- and the three LOOK UP --
And we PUSH IN on Charles and Marin, who watch, amazed, as
the distant light RISES INTO THE SKY --
