    FADE IN:


    EXT. SUGARLOAF STATE PRESERVE - MORNING

    A blast of sky and sun.  The wet smell of brine lays a heavy 
    canopy over three-hundred year old mangroves.  A place where 
    lush green earth meets clear blue sky.

    A wave of humid air pushes Spanish moss out over Fisheating 
    Creek, a dark, handsome river that cuts through Sugarloaf, 
    Florida.  One of many Pinkberry communities that sprung up east 
    of Tampa in the last half-decade, thanks to cheap mortgages and 
    really bad ideas.  We know how that worked out.

    CREDITS over its indigenous beauty; a virtual Garden of Eden, a 
    million years old and still in the game.  Caladium the size of 
    an elephant s ear anchor a line of flowering plants, herbaceous 
    fern and fleshy white magnolia.  Peach palm sagos, entwined in 
    passion vine.  A leggy Blue Heron picks at the mud bank.  A 
    couple of small gators drift silently among the lilies, little 
    more than a pair of eyes, keeping an eye on everything.  Such as

    A TOYOTA RAV 4

    Parked thirty feet from the creek.  Von Dutch detailing, 20 inch 
    rims, suggesting an owner of a certain age.


    INT. TOYOTA RAV 4 - MORNING

    Inside, a man and a girl, asleep.  Not cuddling, hardly even 
    touching.  Oh, and the girl - she s not wearing pants.  Just a 
    throwback Buccaneer's jersey riding up high enough to see a pair 
    of pink and blue striped panties.  From GAP, if I had to guess.

    The man, KERRY, is a good looking kid of 22, with an athletic 
    build.  You d fuck him if you were her, which it appears as if 
    she did, last night.  The girl, ERIN, is 16.  Without a doubt 
    you d fuck her - soft blonde hair, a hard and tight body.  Two 
    kids from middle-class families, exploring the nature of things.  
    Both dead asleep ...

    Until one of those heron leap off the bank with a shrieking 
    whoop, and glides, whooping, out over the swamp.

    Waking Kerry.  His eyes open and we know immediately this kid 
    did some drinking last night.  Red, bleary eyes.  Head pounding.  
    He struggles for short term memory, looks over at Erin, dead 
    asleep, vintage tee and panties - jogging some of last night 
    back to him.  He fishes around a dash board cluttered with beer 
    cans for his smokes.  She stirs but does not wake.

    Kerry studies her body.  More of the night returns to him in a 
    flood of drunken memories, driving his need for fresh air.                                                                                      2.




    EXT. FISHEATING CREEK - MORNING

    Kerry steps out, shirtless, barefoot.  He scratches at his face, 
    rolls the kinks out of his neck and shoulders.  Heads for the 
    creek over cypress root that knob like veins along the ground.

    He drops to his knees at the creek, running water over his face 
    and through his hair.  Shakes out a smoke, which he lights and 
    inhales, deeply.  He turns to look back at the RAV, to see that 
    the girl has not moved.  The cigarette making him sicker, so he 
    flicks it into the creek, the butt dying in the black water with 
    a tsssst, not far from a body.  A dead one.

    A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN

    Without a head, hands or feet, lies in the shallow mud.  The 
    better part of her right leg and shoulder bitten clean off.

    KERRY

    Stares at the body for a long beat.  Trying to focus.  He 
    struggles through the knee-deep water to get a closer look, 
    stopping a few yards away.  The closer look sends him stumbling 
    back for shore, where he collapses on the bank to get sick.


    INT. TOYOTA RAV 4 - MORNING

    Erin wakes to the sound of his RETCHING.  She sits up, sees 
    Kerry at the edge of the creek.  She fumbles along the dash, 
    finds a watch and checks the time.

                                  ERIN
                    Shit.

    She stands on the horn.

                                  ERIN
                    Kerry!  Shit.

    The HORN sends Kerry into a second wave of retching. 

    Off which, the camera CRANES up and over the mangrove to FIND 
    the tri-bay area of Tampa/St. Pete/Clearwater, a mile and a half 
    west, buffeting the azure waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


    EXT. ROBBIE S RAW BAR - DAY

    Waterfront bar and grill, off Sugarloaf Key Beach.  Sunday 
    morning crowd, bikini-tops and cut off jeans, driving hangovers 
    away with grouper and avocado omelettes, mango margaritas, 
    oysters on the half shell and blood orange mimosas - brunch on 
    the west coast of Florida.                                                                                        3.


    Jet skis line the marina, maybe a dozen vehicles in the parking 
    lot, where a nondescript sedan pulls off Pinellas Highway and 
    noses into a spot near the back kitchen door.

    MIKE OGLETREE, a thick around the middle 41 year-old detective 
    with the Florida State Police, gets out of the vehicle, groaning 
    and clutching his lower back, moves for the back entrance when 
    he stops, notices something on the side of the restaurant wall:

                        Okeechobee Southerner s are Sub-Human

    ... whatever the hell that means, spray painted in red paint on 
    the side of Robbie s Bar.  Ogletree fingers the paint, sniffs 
    his fingers.  Glances around the parking lot, then heads inside.


    INT. ROBBIE S RAW BAR - DAY

    Ogletree steps to the counter, nodding  morning  to a few of the 
    locals.  The owner, ROBBIE RENNER, 35, sun-kissed, swimmer s bod 
    and nobody s fool, busy shucking oysters.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Robbie.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Mike.

    Ogletree watches her lightening-quick shucking as she fills a 
    tray of goobers.

                                  OGLETREE
                      Management shucking oysters.  You 
                    got employees who can do that.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Not as fast as I can.  Besides.  I 
                    like to get my hands dirty.

    They share a brief smile.  He watches her a beat, then --

                                  OGLETREE
                    You mind if I --

    Help himself to a to-go cup of coffee.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Yeah, no, go ahead.

    Ogletree moves behind the counter, pours himself coffee.

                                  ROBBIE
                    You see what some jackass did to my 
                    wall out there?

                                  OGLETREE
                    I did.  Not quite sure I take its 
                    meaning.                                                                                      4.



                                  ROBBIE
                    Means after I close up tonight, I 
                    get to do some painting.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Any idea who might have done it?

                                  ROBBIE
                    Hell, you know me.  I m sure I 
                    pissed off someone, I usually do.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Same thing was painted on the 
                    Marriott off Interlake.  Another on 
                    the airport overpass.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Then I won t take it personally.

    She smiles, wipes her hands on her apron to help bag his coffee 
    as he pulls out his cell, thumbing in a text.

                                  ROBBIE
                    That why you re working on a 
                    Sunday?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Nope.  We got a floater.
                          (off her look)
                    -- someone dumped a body into 
                      Fisheating creek.

                                  ROBBIE
                    That s a nice thing.  Dope dealing?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Naw.  She didn t look like she was 
                    into that.

                                  ROBBIE
                    A  she , huh?  Good-looking?

                                  OGLETREE
                    I don t know.  She didn t have a 
                    head.

    Ogletree hits the button to send his text, then hangs up.

                                                                            CUT TO:


    EXT. PALM HARBOR COUNTRY CLUB - GOLF COURSE - DAY

    A lush Pete Dye gem, hugging the bay at Crystal Beach.  On the 
    fourteenth tee, JIM LONGWORTH, fit, still boyish at thirty-nine, 
    addresses the ball as a cell phone clipped to his bag warbles.  
    His playing partner, CARLOS, checks the number.                                                                                      5.



                                  CARLOS
                    It s him again.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Excuse me.  I m over the ball.

    Carlos shakes his head as Longworth takes a couple of waggles 
    then swings, sending the ball long and deep down the fairway.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    God damn.  Did you see that?

                                  CARLOS
                    You re the only person I know who 
                    swears worse the better he plays.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Shit that was sweet.

    Longworth pumps his fist, psyched, drops into the cart.  He guns 
    the shitty engine down the fairway.


    EXT. PALM HARBOR COUNTRY CLUB - FAIRWAY - DAY

      Longworth s ball sits up nicely in the soft Bermuda grass.  
    Their golf cart stops and Longworth gets out, sliding a six iron 
    out of his bag.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What am I looking at?

                                  CARLOS
                      One-seventy to carry the bunker.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Shit.  I m between clubs ...

    Longworth steps back from the ball, looks up to the green.  He 
    rips a little grass from the roots, tossing it into the air to 
    check the wind.  Carlos shaking his head ...

    Longworth grabs a six iron, a little self-talk as he addresses 
    the ball.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Ball below my feet - shape the ball 
                    a little left to right ...

    Longworth sets up, waggles, then steps back again.

                                  CARLOS
                    Just hit the damn thing.
                          (re the foursome behind 
                            them)
                    They re back up behind us.                                                                                      6.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    They can wait.

                                  CARLOS
                    They re gonna get pissed off and 
                    hit into us.  Then you re gonna get 
                    pissed off and try and arrest  em 
                    for something.

    Longworth looks back where a foursome is waiting to tee off.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    They don t look that tough to me.

                                  CARLOS
                    My wife s gonna cut my balls off if 
                    I don t get home and help with the 
                    kids.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m four over at the turn, mi 
                    amigo, five holes away from 
                    breaking eighty for the first time 
                    in my life.

                                  CARLOS
                    Don t speak Spanish to me, you 
                      condescending prick.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m bridging a cultural divide.

                                  CARLOS
                    You are a cultural divide.  Hit the 
                    ball.

      A different cell phone warble.  Carlos checks his phone ...

                                  CARLOS
                    Now he s calling me.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Don t answer it.

    Carlos flips open the cell phone.

                                  CARLOS
                    Hello?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m not here.

                                  CARLOS
                    Yeah, he s right here.

    Carlos tosses the phone to Longworth.  Longworth gives him a 
    look, brings the cell phone to his ear.                                                                                      7.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    You must ve heard.  I m four over 
                    at the turn.  Birdied three, seven 
                    and ten, with a lip out at eleven.
                          (listens, then)
                    We ll she s not gonna be any deader 
                    an hour from now.

    A ball bounces a few yards away, skipping past them.  Carlos and 
    Longworth look back to see the foursome behind them.  Apparently 
    tired of the bullshit, they re playing through.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    How under-aged are we talking?
                          (listens, then)
                    What was she doing out there, was 
                    she doin  the guy?  Well what the 
                    hell did you ask?

    Longworth cradles the phone as he steps to the ball.  He takes a 
    swing, sending it sailing back to the tee box, under --

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Listen, just stick her in a room 
                    and don t let her talk to anyone.  
                    I want a clean shot at her before 
                    her parents shut her up.

    Longworth hangs up, tosses the phone back to Carlos.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Call your wife and open your 
                    office.

                                  CARLOS
                    It s Sunday, my office is closed.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I just opened it.

    Longworth waves an HISPANIC GROUNDS KEEPER over.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Excuse me.  See this ball?  Es yo 
                    bolito - se?

    The grounds keeper nods as Longworth flashes his badge.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    This ball is part of a murder

    The worker nods.  Longworth gets in the cart with Carlos and 
    they ride off.  The worker stands there.

    INT. FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICE - DAY

    Erin sits alone in a small office.  She looks tired but not 
    particularly anxious over events of the morning.  Buoyed, 
    perhaps, by events of the night.


    INT. FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL - BREAK ROOM - DAY

    Longworth waits for a burrito to re-heat in the microwave.  
    Ogletree stirs a packet of sugar into his coffee from Robbie s 
    as he teases out details from a work in progress protocol.

                                  OGLETREE
                    No scar tissue, no water in her 
                    lungs - nothing in her stomach ...

    The microwave DINGS.  Longworth goes for his burrito.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Ah!  Shit.

    Longworth burns his hand grabbing the hot burrito.

                                  OGLETREE
                    You wanna go look at the body?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    She s dead.  I wanna talk to the 
                    girl.  Any word from her folks?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Her mom is M.I.A.  Apparently not 
                    unusual for a Saturday night, 
                      especially with her husband on a 
                    poker run in the Keys.                                                                                      9.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Any o  these geniuses have a 
                    record?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Law abiding, far as we know.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What about the boy?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Local kid.  Kerry Brussard.  Twenty-

                          (beat)
                    I sent him home.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Why?

                                  OGLETREE
                    He threw up on my keyboard giving 
                    his statement.
                          (beat)
                    Got a call into the girl s folks.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Okay.

                                  OGLETREE
                    She s sixteen.  Can t talk to her 
                    without a parent or guardian ...

    But Longworth is already on the move ...


    INT. FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

    Longworth enters, sits across from Erin as he eats his burrito.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You get anything to eat?
                          (silence)
                    You want something?  Burrito or 
                      something?  Something to drink?

    She shakes her head no.  Longworth looks at her a beat.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Would you be more comfortable if we 
                    waited till we located one of your 
                    parents?

                                  ERIN
                    My parents?  Good luck with that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You re okay talking to me, then?                                                                                    10.



    She shrugs sure, whatever.  Longworth sits across from her.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    We sent your whatever he is - 
                    boyfriend or whatever, home.  He 
                    puked on my partner s keyboard.

                                  ERIN
                    He drinks too much.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He s also older than you.  Did you 
                    guys have relations?

                                  ERIN
                    What do you mean?  Did I screw him?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah, did you screw him.

                                  ERIN
                    Is that important?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Maybe.

    She looks at him a beat.  Not sure where he s going.

                                  ERIN
                    I m old enough to give consent. 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You re sixteen.  That s not old 
                    enough.  Legally.

                                  ERIN
                    Are you going to arrest him?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Did he have sex with you?

                                  ERIN
                    No.
                          (off his look)
                    And what s this got to do with the 
                    woman without the head?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I don t know yet.

    Erin looks at him.  Digesting that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He says you guys got out there a 
                    little after ten o clock and slept 
                    out there all night?  Did you see 
                    or hear anything?                                                                                    11.



                                  ERIN
                    You mean, related to the woman?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah.  Did you see or hear anything 
                    that might help us identify who she 
                    was.  Like the person or persons 
                    who dumped her there.

                                  ERIN
                    Maybe she died there.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Maybe.  But we don t think so.

                                  ERIN
                    What do you think happened?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I think she was killed somewhere 
                    else and dumped there so an 
                    alligator could destroy the 
                    evidence.

    Erin takes a beat with that. Shakes her head no.

                                  ERIN
                    I didn t hear anything.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What about this spot?  Anything 
                    about it special for you two?

                                  ERIN
                    No. 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    No special meaning?

                                  ERIN
                    No.  Just a place to go.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    A place other people go to maybe?
                    Young people.  To party, get drunk.  
                    Try sex?

    She doesn t respond, but yeah, basically.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So it s kind of a dumb place to 
                    dump a body.  If someone knew that.

                                  ERIN
                    Maybe it s a good place, if you re 
                    tryin  to mess with the cops.                                                                                    12.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Is that something you think about?  
                    Messing with us for trying to keep 
                    things safe and orderly?

                                  ERIN
                    I m just saying.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So was this your first time trying 
                    sex? 

                                  ERIN
                    Trying?  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hey, I m still trying.  Don t ever 
                    wanna get too good at a thing, it 
                    becomes routine. 

                                  ERIN
                    How do you know she didn t float 
                    there from upriver?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Doesn t figure that way, 
                      forensically.

                                  ERIN
                    Are you an expert in forensics?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m an expert in all things 
                      homicidal, Erin.  There isn t much 
                    about murder I don t know.  Or 
                    can t find out.  If I just keep 
                    asking the right questions.

    They stare at each other.

                                                                            CUT TO:


    EXT. SUGARLOAF STATE PRESERVE - FISHEATING CREEK - AFTERNOON

    Crime scene tape marks off a hundred or so square feet which 
    have been cordoned off to the public.  A State Police Department 
    vehicle sits inside the area, parked along side the marsh.

    We FIND Longworth, sitting on the bank, shoes and socks off, 
    rolling up his pant legs.  A nine iron at his side, which he 
    picks up then wades into the water.

    The water is to his mid-thigh.  He tries to peer down into the 
    dark, brackish water as he sifts through the silt with the nine 
    iron, raking it across the river floor.                                                                                      13.


    He snags on something, dips to fish around the bottom with his 
    hand, holding his head just above the water line, when he 
    suddenly lurches out of the water, staggering back and out of 
    the way of


    AN ANGRY FIVE FOOT ALLIGATOR

    whipping in a near full-breech having taken a good nip out of 
      Longworth s hand.  Longworth stumbles back onto the bank, more 
    in shock than in pain as the alligator drifts off, already 
    losing interest in the startled lawman.

                                                                            CUT TO:


    INT. TAMPA BAY MEDICAL CENTER - EVENING

    Longworth in a hospital gown, a bandage over his right hand, is 
    bent over an exam table as a health care worker draws antibiotic 
    into a syringe behind him.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Is this absolutely necessary?

    The health care worker, CALLIE, a pretty thirty-two year old 
    with a tough veneer, rubs an alcohol cotton ball on his ass.

                                  CALLIE
                    You want to die of infection?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He looked pretty hygienic to me.

                                  CALLIE
                    Everyone looks hygienic till the 
                    blood work comes back.

    She looks for a spot on his ass to administer the shot, stops to 
    run a finger over scar tissue in the middle of his back.

                                  CALLIE
                    Either that s an exit wound or the 
                    surgeons in Chicago are all drunks.

    He looks back at her, impressed she knew what it was.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    My captain shot me.

                                  CALLIE
                    On purpose?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He thought I was sleeping with his 
                    wife ...

    She sticks him with the needle, he blanches slightly.                                                                                    14.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    -- I wasn t.  But I was the only 
                    one in the department that wasn t.

    She drops the gown to re-cover his ass.  He holds up his 
    bandaged hand, testing it, squeezing it open and closed.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    It feels like it s gonna hurt like 
                    hell later on.

                                  CALLIE
                    I can give you something for the 
                    pain, but a six pack of Heineken 
                    will do just as good.  And if I do 
                    give you something and later on you 
                    want that Heineken ...

    Meaning, not on antibiotics, as he mimics a golf grip and swing, 
    annoyed with the clunky bandage and winching for the effort.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    How long you think I m gonna have 
                    to wear this thing?

                                  CALLIE
                    You in some kind of hurry?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I ve got a Titleist with a perfect 
                    lie sitting on the fourteenth 
                    fairway at Palm Harbor, waiting for 
                    me to break eighty for the first 
                    time in my life.

                                  CALLIE
                    With that swing, I m not surprised.

    She hands him a clipboard for his signature.

                                  CALLIE
                    Sign, date and initial where 
                      indicated.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What am I signing?

                                  CALLIE
                    You re releasing the medical center 
                    from liability should you lose that 
                    hand or die from infection due to 
                    my incompetence.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m not signing that.                                                                                    15.



                                  CALLIE
                    You will if you want your clothes 
                    back.

    She leaves.  He smiles, signs the forms.


    EXT. THE COVES OF SUGARLOAF - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

    CLOSE ON a SIGN, announcing the master planned community, with a 
    coral rock  cove , cascading falls and leeward view of the Gulf. 


    INT. THE COVES OF SUGARLOAF - LONGWORTH S HOUSE - NIGHT

    Longworth pours a Heineken, smiling a little as he recalls the 
    advice, and more importantly, the woman who gave it.  He cups a 
    couple of Advil into his mouth, washing them down with the beer.

    He tucks a police file under his arm, and we FOLLOW him through 
    the sliding glass doors, to his pool and screened-in deck area.


    EXT. LONGWORTH HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT

    The light from his pool dances off the walls.  The distant 
    crashing of waves.  He sits down, sips his beer as he studies 
    the file.  A beat, then a CAR door slams in his driveway.

    Longworth rises, moves to see someone getting out of the car, 
    holding a thermal-insulated pizza warmer.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Back here.

    The delivery person heads over, emerging from the shadows into a 
    reflective pool of dappled light to REVEAL it s Callie ...

                                  CALLIE
                    I knew the second I saw the name on 
                    the order I was in trouble.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m sorry.  Is that a pizza you re 
                      delivering?

                                  CALLIE
                    Stuffed crust, sausage and extra 
                    cheese?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I thought you were a nurse?

                                  CALLIE
                    I am.
                          (beat)
                    Eleven dollars and fifty-two cents.                                                                                    16.



                                  LONGWORTH
                      I released the hospital from 
                    liability with the understanding 
                    that you administered health care 
                    for a living.

                                  CALLIE
                    I do.  I also do this.  Eleven 
                    dollars and fifty-two cents.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Who s that waiting for you in the 
                    car?

    Longworth sees a BOY in his early teens sitting in the car.

                                  CALLIE
                    That s my husband.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Your husband is twelve?

                                  CALLIE
                    Okay, he s my son.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He looks annoyed.

                                  CALLIE
                    He s twelve.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So there s a husband somewhere?

                                  CALLIE
                      Somewhere.

    She doesn t elaborate.  He sets the pizza down, fishes out his 
    wallet.  Her eyes stray.  Noting his house, his pool.  His view.

                                  CALLIE
                    Gentle surf and fresh air.  Must be 
                    hell on sleeping.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You get used to it.

    He hands her a bill, which she regards with some annoyance.

                                  CALLIE
                    This is a hundred.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Right.

                                  CALLIE
                    I can t change a hundred.                                                                                    17.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    So keep it.

                                  CALLIE
                    I can t keep this.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Why not?

                                  CALLIE
                    Because it s a hundred and you ve 
                    been hitting on me since we met.

    There is a beat.  The two of them, hold each other s gaze in the 
    dappled, reflective light of the pool.  She hands it back.

                                  CALLIE
                    Here.  You owe me fifteen bucks.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You said eleven-fifty.

                                  CALLIE
                    With tip.  You can drop it off at 
                    the hospital.

    A beat.  He takes the hundred, agreeing to the plan.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I was under the impression nurses 
                    made good money.

                                  CALLIE
                    I was under the impression cops 
                    didn t.

    He looks at her.  Smiles.

                                  CALLIE
                    And we make great money.  It s 
                    Medical School that s killing me.

    Longworth even more impressed, as she refers to his bandaged 
    hand and little spot of red that bleeds through the gauze.

                                  CALLIE
                    Change that before you go to bed.

    She leaves.  He watches her get in the car, sees her son sort of 
    glaring back at him as they head up the street.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                            ACT TWO

    FADE IN:


    INT.  FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL STATION - BREAK ROOM - DAY

    Longworth has a roll of surgical tape, a length of which he is 
    tearing using his teeth.  He wraps the length of tape around his 
    freshly bandaged wound, securing it tight.  He holds the wounded 
    hand with his good hand - it really is starting to throb and 
    hurt.  Despite the pain, he manages a slight grin at his injury.


    CLOSE ON A BLOTCH

    Revealed to be a very close, microscopic view of human flesh, 
    viewed through a high powered microscope.  The focus pulls 
    tighter around a cluster of bright red circles, what is commonly 
    referred to as a blood grouping.


    INT. LAB - DAY

    Carlos over a microscope, Longworth at his side.

                                  CARLOS
                    The club manager called.  He wants 
                    you to come pick up your ball.

                                  LONGWORTH
                      I consulted the USGA handbook and 
                      technically, I have seventy-two 
                    hours to resume play following an 
                    injury.

                                  CARLOS
                    What are you talking about?  
                    There s no rule like that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    No, but doesn t that sound like 
                    something those Nazi bastard s 
                    would have a rule about.  And what 
                    crawled up Buddy s ass?

                                  CARLOS
                    He s getting complaints from 
                    members that you ve cordoned off an 
                    area around your ball on the 
                      fourteenth fairway.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I want to finish the round.                                                                                    19.



                                  CARLOS
                    It s gonna be weeks before you can 
                    swing a club, go pick up your ball.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m getting medical treatment, I ll 
                    be fine by the end of the week.  
                    The most heinous crime in this 
                    County s history and I can t get 
                    one professional courtesy? 

    Longworth exits, Carlos shakes his head, returns to his 
    eyepiece.


    INT. FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL - OFFICE - DAY

    Ogletree, sitting uncomfortably at his desk over a file.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    That thing helping?

    He turns as Longworth steps up, nodding to the back support 
    thing strapped to the back of Ogletree s chair.

                                  OGLETREE
                    No.  Lose your uniform again?

    Ogletree in department khakis, Longworth in street clothes.  An 
    on-going source of aggravation for Ogletree ...

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m just saying, hit the gym once 
                    in a while, every little thing 
                    wouldn t throw your back out.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Yeah, we can be workout partners.  
                    Spend even more time together.
                          (re the files)
                    I got Missing Person files from 
                    Orlando, Ocala, Tampa, Miami.  
                    Nothing promising.  I m waiting for 
                      Jacksonville and Naples.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Naples?  That s like old people.  
                    She wasn t that old.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Maybe she was visiting a relative.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Dressed like that, I don t think 
                    so.                                                                                    20.



                                  OGLETREE
                    What s wrong with the way she was 
                    dressed?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Someone she was visiting would ve 
                    called it in if she went missing, 
                    don t you think?

    Ogletree looks at him blankly.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    We may not have her head, compadre, 
                    but we still have ours.

    Longworth heads off.  Ogletree watches him head out.


    EXT. TAMPA BAY MEDICAL CENTER - DAY

    Ten stories of medical offices in the heart of downtown Tampa.  
    Find Callie, exiting the clinic and heading for her car.

    She slows when she sees Longworth leaning against her Nissan.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I hope you don t mind.  I took the 
                    liberty of finding out when you 
                    took your lunch.

                                  CALLIE
                    Which I have with my son.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I was hoping I could run something 
                    by you.

                                  CALLIE
                    And which I m late for.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Don t you even want to know what 
                    about?

                                  CALLIE
                    Your hand hasn t fallen off so I 
                    assume it has something to do with 
                    the body you found in the creek.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    See I have this theory - two 
                    theories, actually.  And if you 
                    know anything about theories, you 
                    know that if you have two of  em 
                    then basically you have shit.  I 
                    need someone like yourself to kind 
                    of walk it through with me.                                                                                    21.



                                  CALLIE
                    Don t you have a partner for that 
                    kind of thing?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah, I do.  Nice guy, very 
                      practical, wife s a hell of a cook, 
                    they have me over for dinner every 
                    Sunday.  But he s not a very good 
                    cop.  He s also not a health care 
                      professional.  Or a woman.  I need 
                    a woman s point of view.

                                  CALLIE
                    Who s a health care professional.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Oh, and before I forget ...

    He hands her a twenty dollar bill.

                                  CALLIE
                    This is a twenty.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Right.

                                  CALLIE
                    I don t have change.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So you owe me five bucks.

                                  CALLIE
                    Look.  When you ve got the right 
                    change.  Let s not keep doing this.

    She hands him the twenty back and gets in her car.

                                  CALLIE
                    And I really can t do this right 
                    now.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Then when you get off tonight.  Say 
                    for dinner.  Which sounds a lot 
                    like a date but it s not.

                                  CALLIE
                    I have to feed my son and get on 
                    him about his homework.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    After that.  Thirty minutes.

                                  CALLIE
                    After that I go to bed.                                                                                    22.



                                  LONGWORTH
                      Breakfast.  My treat, wherever you 
                    want to meet.

    She starts the car.  Concedes an opening.

                                  CALLIE
                    I ll get him fed and at least 
                      pretending he s doing his homework.  
                    You can stop by around eight and 
                    I ll give you thirty minutes.
                          (beat)
                    But do me a favor.  Break that.

    Meaning the twenty.  He watches her pull out.


    EXT. THE DON CESAR - BEACH RESORT - POOL SIDE CABANA - DAY

    A jewel of Deco renovation on the sugar-white sand of St. Pete 
    Beach.

    Longworth talking to a man in a Blue Blazer, who nods him off in 
    a specific direction, which Longworth follows.

    He approaches Kerry, wearing white shorts and cotton shirt with 
    epaulets, setting up cabanas and guest umbrellas for the day.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Got a minute for some questions?

    Kerry glances up briefly.  Continues to set up chairs.

                                  KERRY
                    Can t.  Got to set up for the day. 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Actually, now is what I meant.

    Kerry looks at Longworth, who s pulled out his badge.


    EXT. THE DON CESAR - BEACH - DAY

    Kerry sits with Longworth at the beach side cafe.  Parasails, 
    turquoise water and half-naked tourists in every direction.

                                  KERRY
                    I already gave that other guy my 
                      statement.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Mixed in with chunks of whatever 
                    you had for dinner last night.  I 
                    thought I d do a little follow up 
                    now that you re, presumably, less 
                    hammered.                                                                                    23.



                                  KERRY
                    I didn t have anything to do with 
                    that lady getting killed.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I don t know that.  

                                  KERRY
                    Why would I tell you guys she was 
                    out there if I had something to do 
                    with it?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I dunno, you re a moron?  I already 
                    know you re not very bright ...
                          (off his look)
                    -- it s not murder, but rape will 
                    still get you eight years in 
                    prison, and you brought that to our 
                      attention.

                                  KERRY
                    Rape?  I didn t rape anybody.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    The presumption is a sixteen year 
                    old isn t emotionally ready to 
                    consent to a sexual encounter, so 
                    legally, the presumption is a clear 
                     no  across the board.  Having sex 
                    with someone who says no, is rape.

                                  KERRY
                    The legal age is sixteen.  She 
                    looked it up or something, went on 
                    line.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    She lied to you about that.  Which 
                    I m guessing you believed because 
                    it synced up better with your 
                    immediate needs.  Any reason you 
                    can think of why she lied to you 
                    about that, like maybe it was her 
                    first time?

                                  KERRY
                    Her first time, that s hilarious.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    She indicated to me that it was.

                                  KERRY
                    Maybe she just indicated that to 
                    you to mess with you.  And what s 
                    that got to do with the woman 
                    without the head?                                                                                    24.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    What is with everyone and that 
                    question?  Don t you know how a 
                    police investigation works?  We ask 
                      questions.  Sometimes direct, 
                    sometimes indirect, it doesn t 
                    matter if they make sense to you, 
                    half the time they don t make sense 
                    to me.  

                                  KERRY
                    I know she s lying because I know 
                    for a fact a guy she did before me.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    How do you know he s not lying?

                                  KERRY
                    Because he was my brother.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What do you mean, was?  Is your 
                    brother dead?

                                  KERRY
                    Yeah, he s dead.  Got clipped on 
                    his motorcycle by a goddamn tourist 
                    on U.S. 75.  At Interlake and 75, 
                    where the goddamn light.  Put that 
                    goddamn light up right after it 
                    happened, like some goddamn 
                    reminder to me, so that every time 
                    I drive by I get to goddamn 
                    remember how he got mangled by some 
                    goddamn Previa driving asshole from 
                    goddamn friggin  Maine.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Well at least you ve worked through 
                    it.

    Kerry glares at Longworth.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m gonna need to ask you a few 
                    more questions, so don t leave town 
                    without checking with me first.

                                  KERRY
                    Why?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m pretty sure we just covered 
                    that.

    Longworth gets up and leaves.  Off Kerry ...                                                                                    25.




    EXT. CALLIE S HOUSE - BACK PORCH LANAI - NIGHT

    Longworth and Callie sit in the screened-in lanai.  The file 
    with photos and medical protocol sit opened on a table.

                                  CALLIE
                    No one s reported her missing?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Not yet, anyway.

                                  CALLIE
                    How long has she been dead?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    My guy is telling me two or three 
                    days.

                                  CALLIE
                    You have a guy?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He s not my own personal guy.  I 
                    have to share him with the county.

    Callie mildly amused despite her best efforts.

                                  CALLIE
                    So you were shot by your captain 
                    for not sleeping with his wife and 
                    ended up here.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    More or less.  Got a little money 
                    for it.  Not a fortune as it turns 
                    out, but enough to set myself up in 
                    a decent, albeit foreclosure  
                    plagued Master planned community, 
                    and not have to look over my 
                    shoulder.  But trust me, if it ever 
                    gets too busy, or too dangerous, 
                    I m out of here.

                                  CALLIE
                    Was that more, or less?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    That was less the parts I m keeping 
                    out because I m trying to impress 
                    you.

                                  CALLIE
                    You were fired.                                                                                    26.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Not so much fired as asked to leave 
                    and never come back.

    She gives him a look.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I don t play well with others.  
                    Have no idea why, I ve just always 
                    done better alone.  Which doesn t 
                    work in law enforcement.  You know 
                    they actually expected me to share 
                    my theories with other people?  I 
                    mean like everyone, like other 
                      detectives in like other precincts 
                    and shit.  Insane.

                                  CALLIE
                    Imagine the cooperation something 
                    like that would incite.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I finally stopped fighting it.  
                    Took a job with the FHP, well off 
                    the bureaucratic grid.

                                  CALLIE
                    Good plan.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    It was till the bottom fell out.  
                    Property taxes crashed, public 
                    services stretched so thin my 
                      department s being forced to  asset 
                    share  with the entire state of 
                    Florida.  Which means sharing 
                      jurisdiction with every police 
                    agency within the Florida 
                      Department of Law Enforcement and 
                    the Office of Public Safety.  Not 
                    what I had in mind.

                                  CALLIE
                    I have a question.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Shoot.

                                  CALLIE
                    Are we ever gonna get around to why 
                    you need a woman s perspective or 
                    can I just assume I ve been had?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    That s a complicated question.  Do 
                    you have a beer or something?                                                                                    27.



                                  CALLIE
                    I always have beer.  But frankly, I 
                    don t want my son to think there s 
                    something going on here.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Can t we just tell him there s 
                    nothing going on as I sip my beer?

                                  CALLIE
                      Technically, I m still married.  
                    And Jeff likes to dialogue with his 
                    father about my activities.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Where is he?

                                  CALLIE
                    He s supposed to be in his bedroom 
                    not doing his homework.  But my 
                    guess is he s spying on us.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I meant his father, the guy you re 
                      technically still married to.

    Callie takes a beat.

                                  CALLIE
                    Raiford.

    That s a really bad prison in Central Florida.

                                  LONGWORTH
                      Impressive.

                                  CALLIE
                    Yup.
                          (beat)
                    Jeff?
                          (then over her shoulder)
                    Jeff?!

    Then, from out in the dark --

                                  JEFF (O.S.)
                    What?

                                  CALLIE
                    Homework.

                                  JEFF (O.S.)
                      I finished.

                                  CALLIE
                    All of it?                                                                                    28.



                                  JEFF (O.S.)
                    What part of finished is confusing 
                    to you?

    She looks at Longworth.  That s my son.

                                  JEFF (O.S.)
                    What are you two talking about?

    From the darkness of the back yard emerges her son JEFF, 12, a 
    good looking kid struggling to reconcile his parent s odd and up 
    for grabs marital status.

                                  CALLIE
                    Like you haven t been listening.

    Jeff grabs the file, and photo of the dead woman.

                                  JEFF
                    Is this that woman you guys found?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    No, that s another woman.
                          (off his look)
                    Yes, that s the woman we found.

                                  JEFF
                    What happened to her head?

                                  CALLIE
                    Put those back.

    She takes the photo back, stuffs it back into the file.

                                  JEFF
                    Did she offer you a beer?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    No.  And I even asked nicely.

                                  JEFF
                    I ll get it.

                                  CALLIE
                    He won t be here long enough.  He 
                    was just about to get to the reason 
                    he came over, then leave.  Now go 
                    finish your homework.

                                  JEFF
                    Oh my God, I just told you.

                                  CALLIE
                    For real, this time.

    After a beat, and prompted by his mother s glare, Jeff 
    disappears into the house.  When she s sure he s gone ...                                                                                    29.



                                  CALLIE
                    Cartage theft.  My husband.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I wasn t going to ask.

                                  CALLIE
                    A dock worker was shot and killed 
                    during a heist.  Not by Frank, but 
                    you know how it goes.  Now do you 
                    really have something you wanna run 
                    by me, or can we say good night?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    When did you lose your virginity?

                                  CALLIE
                    Upp.  Look at the time ...

                                  LONGWORTH
                    No.  I m serious.  The one person 
                    who might be able to help me, may 
                    or may not have lost hers the night 
                    they found the body.  I mean, I ve 
                    heard rumors about you people ...
                          (off her look)
                    -- is it possible for a girl to 
                     lose her virginity  to more than 
                    one guy?

                                  CALLIE
                    Sure.  I lost mine three or four 
                    times.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Really?  And we just fall for that?

                                  CALLIE
                    You figure yourself for an expert 
                    on hymens?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So she s lying, then.  

                                  CALLIE
                    Probably.  How old is she?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Sixteen.

                                  CALLIE
                    Oh yeah.  And if the question is, 
                    do we lie to guys and let  em think 
                    we re giving  em something special 
                    so they ll hang around a while?  
                    Yes.  We do that.                                                                                    30.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    What would you say about a girl who 
                     gave her virginity  to a couple of 
                    brothers?

                                  CALLIE
                    As in same parents brothers?  I d 
                    say this chick was good.  Or 
                      desperate.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    For what?

                                  CALLIE
                    Love.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    She didn t strike me as a girl 
                    short on self-esteem.

                                  CALLIE
                    And you would know?  For certain?

    He looks at her.  Maybe not so certain.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    See?  I knew talking to you was a 
                    good idea.  By the way, what kind 
                    of girl are you?

                                  CALLIE
                    In terms of what?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    How far you d go to protect a 
                    secret?  Or lie to some guy to 
                    twist him around your finger.

    She looks at him a beat.

                                  CALLIE
                    My husband s in prison.  Does that 
                    answer your question?

    Yes it does.  Off which ...

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    31.



                                          ACT THREE

    FADE IN:


    EXT. HIGHWAY INTERSECTION - U.S. 75 - NIGHT

    CLOSE on a TRAFFIC LIGHT, burning green in a moonless night.  

    ECU of the instrument, the screen filled with green.  Emitting 
    an electronic BUZZ.  The light shifts from green to yellow, 
    angle widening now to include it.  Then on again to red.  

    The light glows, instrument swinging in a light ocean breeze.

    WIDER

    A vehicle, a sedan, comes to a full stop at the intersection.


    INT. LONGWORTH S CAR - NIGHT

    Longworth at the wheel, annoyed he caught the light.  He looks 
    left and right, even more annoyed to realize there s no traffic 
    in either direction. 

    He waits, checking his bandaged hand, squeezing and unsqueezing 
    his grip, wincing slightly from discomfort.

    He looks at the light, still red.  When something at the curb of 
    the intersection catches his eye.

    A  shrine  at the base of the traffic light.  Beer cans and 
    liquor bottles, candles, notes, flowers, relatively fresh.

    Longworth gets out of the car and steps to the shrine.

    He kneels to read a few notes and cards, all a loving tribute to 
     Lane , live fast and die hard, etc.

    Longworth looks up at the street signs at the intersection.

    U.S. 75 and Interlake Boulevard.  

    A car HORN blasts -- some idiot behind his idling car, pissed to 
    be waiting behind a light that s turned green.

                                                                            CUT TO:


    EXT. LANDINGS - BAR - NIGHT

      Overlooking the Marina and Old Tampa Bay, ringed by the lights 
    of downtown Tampa and West Shore Plaza, between which the Metro 
    light-rail glides silently.                                                                                    32.




    INT. LANDINGS - BAR - NIGHT

    The place busy with a night time crowd.  The MUSIC jazz-infused, 
    the vibe, half drunk and sexy.  Longworth enters, carrying a 
    file.  He looks around the bar, sees someone through the crowd, 
    in the distance by the pinball machines.

    He starts over, then stops when he sees Ogletree sitting alone 
    at the bar, staring into a highball.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hey.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Oh.  Hey. 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What are you drinking?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Bourbon.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You don t drink bourbon.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Sometimes I do.  Have a seat.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m looking for Carlos.  His wife 
                    said he likes to come here for the 
                    old school pinballs.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Haven t seen him.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He s right there.

    Ogletree looks to where Longworth is pointing.

                                  OGLETREE
                    I didn t even see him.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What was the name of that kid s 
                    brother?

                                  OGLETREE
                    What kid?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Kerry.  Was it Lane?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Lane?  Maybe.  Yeah.  Why?                                                                                    33.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    There s a shrine for him at the 
                    light at Interlake and 75.  When 
                    was that accident that killed him?

                                  OGLETREE
                    I don t know.  A year ago, maybe.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    To the day?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Maybe.  About that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Are you okay?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Yeah.  Just fighting with my wife, 
                    is all.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You guys don t fight.

                                  OGLETREE
                    We don t very often.  She went to 
                    her sisters - whatever.  Big drama 
                    queen, right?  You want a drink?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Let me take care of this first.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Sure, sure.  I ll be here.

    ANGLE ON CARLOS

    Slamming into a pinball machine as Longworth approaches.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Why didn t you tell me there was a 
                    tooth?

                                  CARLOS
                    What are you talking about?

    Longworth pulls out the Medical Exam protocol.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    It says you pulled a tooth from the 
                    vic.

                                  CARLOS
                    A cuspid.  From the alligator.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Why didn t you tell me?                                                                                    34.



                                  CARLOS
                    What difference does it make?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Carlos, a tooth can tell us all 
                    kinds of things.

                                  CARLOS
                    About the alligator.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Size, sex, migration ... 

                                  CARLOS
                    Of the alligator.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Digestive system, is it fast, slow, 
                    one week, two weeks?

                                  CARLOS
                    Okay.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    It s been three days, maybe the 
                    head is still intact. 

                                  CARLOS
                    Are you out of your mind?  How are 
                    you gonna find the one alligator in 
                    a swamp of goddamn alligators who 
                    fed on our Jane Doe?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    With the tooth.

                                  CARLOS
                    No wonder your partner hates you.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Don t be so lazy, Carlos.

                                  CARLOS
                    Did you just call me lazy?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    When s the tox screen scheduled?

                                  CARLOS
                    Tomorrow.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I want to go with you.

                                  CARLOS
                    I m not taking you to the lab with 
                    me.                                                                                    35.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Why not?

                                  CARLOS
                    The last time I did that they had a 
                    problem with you.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So.  Professional courtesy.

                                  CARLOS
                      Professional courtesy?  You told 
                    them they had their head up their 
                    ass.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    They do.  Or they did.  I have no 
                    idea if it s a recurring problem or 
                    not.  I ll keep an open mind.

    Longworth heads off before Carlos can object.  Carlos slugs more 
    coins in, cajoling the pinball machine back to life.

    Longworth returns to where Ogletree was sitting, his empty 
    bourbon and a beer sit there.  Money on the bar to pay for both.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Excuse me?  What happened to the 
                    guy who was sitting here?

                                  BARTENDER
                    Said he was tired.  Beer s for you.


    INT. UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA - DAY

    Longworth with DANIEL KIM, 23, grad student in Herpetology, who 
    looks at the alligator tooth in a plastic baggie --

                                  KIM
                      Melanosuchus, would be my guess.  
                    Genus, phylum, can t be certain 
                    without more research.  But all 
                    members of the chordata family are 
                      territorial.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    And digestion is what, long, short?

                                  KIM
                    Very slow, like ten days.  Let me 
                    hang on to this, do some blood 
                    work, I can probably give you size, 
                    sex, coloring.  Will that help?

    Longworth hands the kid his business card.                                                                                    36.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Call me.


    EXT. RAIFORD FEDERAL PENITENTARY - DAY

    Imposing and fortified, rising out of hard, flat sand.


    INT. RAIFORD FEDERAL PENITENTARY

    Longworth with COLLIER MANUS, 42, old school Florida Deputy 
    Sheriff with a tight crew cut and fit torso tucked into a peat 
    brown uniform which he wears like a second skin.

    They move down a hall, stopping as a guard opens a locked door, 
    allowing them to move deeper for a room at the end of the hall.

                                  MANUS
                    Steppin  on some big toes lettin  
                    you in here.  You will eventually 
                    tell me how this miscreant is 
                    related to your missing Jane Doe?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Just a hunch at this point.

                                  MANUS
                    None of these bad men mind an 
                      interruption in their day, but 
                    their lawyers take exception.  If 
                    your visit doesn t advance your 
                    stated intention, I gotta deal with 
                    that.

    They enter --


    INT. RAIFORD FEDERAL PENITENTARY - OBSERVATION ROOM

    Where FRANK CARGILL, 36, jump suit, sits in the dimly lit room.

                                  MANUS
                    He s a true piece of shit and God 
                    don t like him much for his part in 
                    taking another man s life, but he 
                    has rights.  So tell me something 
                    good and save your lying for Mister 
                    Cargill.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m trying to get into his wife s 
                    pants.

                                  MANUS
                    Lucky for you tinnitus spared me 
                    that revelation.                                                                                      37.



    Manus nods and the light in the room comes on.


    INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MINUTES LATER

    Longworth sits across from Frank Cargill.  Frank looking over 
    photos of three men, holding one out he recognizes.

                                    CARGILL
                    This guy, maybe.  Wayne or Dwayne 
                      something.  These other two ...

    Cargill shrugs he doesn t know them.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    This creek sound like a place Wayne 
                    or Dwayne might find himself?

                                    CARGILL
                    Doesn t fish to my knowledge.  
                    Straight up law breaker.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Pretty big piece of violence.

                                    CARGILL
                    Yeah, I m not seeing it.

    Cargill hands the photo back to end the conversation.  Getting 
    the sense he s being fucked with, just not sure why.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What about you?  

                                    CARGILL
                    I don t fish.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You ve never been out there?

                                    CARGILL
                    Have to be clueless or desperate to 
                    go fishing where they aren t any 
                    fish to catch.

    Cargill objecting to the fishing expedition.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    No fish in Fisheating creek?

                                    CARGILL
                    Cane fields leached out all the 
                    niacin.  Nothing but gators, 
                      crackheads and assholes lookin  for 
                    trouble.

    The two men hold each others eyes.                                                                                    38.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    How s your time going, Frank?
                    Got a hearing coming up?  

                                    CARGILL
                    My attorney has all that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Any calls I can make on your 
                    behalf?  Information maybe I can 
                    help bring to light in appreciation 
                    for your thoughts this afternoon --

                                    CARGILL
                    I didn t tell you anything.  But 
                    thank you.

    Cargill clearly doesn t want any help from the lawman.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You sure?  It wouldn t be any 
                    trouble.  Maybe run by, check on 
                    the family, make sure they don t 
                    need anything ...

                                    CARGILL
                    If you could maybe stay the hell 
                    away from my family, that would be 
                    greatly appreciated.


    INT. TAMPA BAY MEDICAL CENTER - DAY

    We follow Callie up the hall, then slows when she sees Longworth 
    enter through the sliding doors.  She seems happy to see him.

                                  CALLIE
                    Hey.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hey.  Got something for you ...

    He hands her some money.

                                  LONGWORTH
                      Seventeen-fifty.  That s the 
                    original fifteen dollars plus a 
                    little something on top for taking 
                    so long.

                                  CALLIE
                    Okay.

    A beat.  She looks confused. 

                                  CALLIE
                    Is something wrong?                                                                                    39.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    I just feel bad I haven t paid you, 
                    is all.

    She figures out what he s done.

                                  CALLIE
                    You went and saw Frank.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Why would you say that?

                                  CALLIE
                    You re paying me.  Not paying me 
                    was how you were keeping this thing 
                    alive.

    She looks at him.  He doesn t deny it.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I was curious.

                                  CALLIE
                    Curious about what?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Whether or not your husband was 
                    someone I could respect.

                                  CALLIE
                    And?


    INT. ORDERLY S DAY ROOM - MINUTES LATER

    They slam inside, ripping at each others clothes, clawing and 
    kissing as they fall into a bed used by staff between shifts.

    They have tremendous first time sex.  Fight to keep quiet but 
    fail miserably.


    INT. ORDERLY S DAY ROOM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

    Longworth putting his shoes and socks on as she comes out of the 
    bathroom, straightening her uniform which she just put back on.

                                  CALLIE
                    You know, it wouldn t come as a 
                    huge surprise to Frank to learn I 
                    was seeing someone.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    That would be between you and 
                    Frank.  And Jeff.                                                                                    40.



                                  CALLIE
                    No, it wouldn t.  Because if we do 
                    this?  We re gonna tell Frank or 
                    we re no better.

    She walks out of the room.   His cell phone rings.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Not bad from just one tooth.

                                  KIM
                    Go you one better, caiman aren t 
                      indigenous.  Probably someone s pet

                    big.  Won t be the only croc in the 
                    area but she ll definitely be the 
                    only caiman.  Wait.  Here we go ...

    The point of view shifts to binocular ...

    A pair of eyes drifting ahead of a spine, specific markings 
    which he enthusiastically describes --

                                  KIM (O.C.)
                    Broad snout, bony ridge over the 
                    eyes, definitely caiman.  Female 
                    coloring, easy ten footer ...

    When BAM!  The lens jolts, taking us back out to

    Kim recoiling from the report from Longworth s gun. 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    That s the one, right?

    Kim stares at Longworth in disbelief.  Stunned.

                                  KIM
                    That animal is protected.                                                                                    41.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Then how come I had such a clear 
                    shot?

    Longworth holsters his gun.  Off Kim, yawning his hearing back

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    42.



                                          ACT FOUR

    FADE IN:


    INT. LAB - DAY

    A ten-foot CAIMAN lies on top of a surgical table.  Daniel Kim 
    over it, marking an area near the stomach with a red marker.

    Carlos and Longworth, off to the side, Carlos pissed there s an 
    alligator on his table.  

                                  CARLOS
                      Unorthodoxed?  Try nuts.

                                  LONGWORTH
                      Unorthodox.  There s no  ed  at the 
                    end ...

                                  CARLOS
                    I m not autopsying an alligator.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Caiman.  Then let the kid do it.

                                  CARLOS
                    Right, and Chain of Command goes 
                    out the window.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    See, you think I m right.

                                  CARLOS
                    I think you re nuts but we ve been 
                    over that already.


    ANGLE ON AUTOPSY TABLE

    Daniel Kim is over the caiman, gestures along a section of the 
    reptile s belly marked with red, as they step up.

                                  KIM
                    Tubal absorption runs along the 
                    length of the thorax.  Anything 
                    this guy s eaten in the last ten 
                    days will be right along here.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Look at that?  All marked up for 
                    you and everything.

                                  KIM
                    Thanks for letting me observe, Dr. 
                    Sanchez.  I really appreciate it.                                                                                    43.



                                  CARLOS
                    Yeah.  No problem.

    Carlos shoots Longworth a look, takes a scalpel, inserts it 
    along the marking.  A tough hide requiring a great deal of 
    effort as he saws along the cut line.

                                  KIM
                    The caiman latirostris is pretty 
                    efficient as a predator.  Eats 
                    fish, turtles ... small land 
                    creatures like raccoon, possum ... 
                    pretty much anything that ventures 
                    into it s waters, especially if 
                    it s nesting or just gave birth ...

    The cut finished, Carlos inserts a gloved hand into the opening.  

                                  KIM
                    Their enzyme production is really 
                    low cause they have like no immune 
                    system - basically they never get 
                    sick, so it gets pretty backed up 
                    in there ...

    He begins removing fleshy debris, which Kim identifies as Carlos 
    pulls out, dropping it into a blue container --

                                  KIM
                    -- catfish ... I d say brim or 
                    perch maybe ... box turtle ...

    Which Carlos drops it in, feels briefly around inside, then --

                                  CARLOS
                    Okay.  That s it.

                                  KIM
                    No, there s more.
                          (off Carlos  look)
                    I can feel it.
                          (he feels, confirming)
                    Yeah, definitely.

    Beat.  Carlos looks at Longworth, runs his hand back inside.

    When he feels something and stops.  Adjusts his slippery grip 
    and pulls it out.  Covered in blood and partially digested.

    But clearly a human jaw bone.

                                  KIM
                    Oh man.  Sweet ...

    Carlos, half amazed, half annoyed.  Longworth piles on.                                                                                    44.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hey, Carlos.  Guess who else is 
                    named Carlos?  

    Carlos ignores him, snapping off his gloves.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Chuck Norris.

                                  CARLOS
                    What?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah, Chuck Norris  real name is 
                    Carlos.  Daniel taught me that.

                                  KIM
                    I love Chuck Norris.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    And his brother s name is Aaron.  
                    Did you ever think Chuck Norris 
                    would have a brother named Aaron?  
                    How gay is that?

                                  CARLOS
                    You did not just call me gay.


    INT. FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL - STATION - DAY

    Ogletree at his desk, annoyed and groaning over his keyboard.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Anything popping with that?

                                  OGLETREE
                    It keeps asking me if I want to 
                    download a new version.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Ignore it.  Most departments work 
                    off Adobe three-point-nine years 
                    ago anyway.  

                                  OGLETREE
                    Tourists, transients, illegals - 
                    this is Florida.  Thousands of 
                    visitors from all over the world 
                    pass through this time of year ...

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Just focus on the one s who ve been 
                    reported missing.

                                  OGLETREE
                    What if they haven t?                                                                                    45.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Family, co-workers, friends, 
                      eventually someone calls it in.

                                  OGLETREE
                    And then there s HIPPA rules ...

                                  LONGWORTH
                    We have some leg work to do before 
                    we start asking for dental records.  
                    Pace yourself.  It ll come 
                    together.

                                  OGLETREE
                    You could help.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I found the jaw bone.

    Not what he wanted to hear.  Longworth throws him a bone.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I saved you a trip to the high 
                    school ...

    Longworth fans open a high school yearbook showing him a page of 
    graduating seniors.  One in particular --

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Lane Brussard, class of  02, and I 
                    quote:  Okeechobee Southerner s Are 
                      Sub-Human .  A quote that s been 
                    popping up all over the high school 
                    this past week.

    Ogletree refusing to give it up.

                                  OGLETREE
                    We still don t know what it means.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    It means the one-year anniversary 
                    of his brother being killed by a 
                    tourist had not gone forgotten.


    EXT. ROBBIE S RAW BAR - DAY

    CLOSE on red letters  Okeechobee Southerners Are Sub-human , 
    spray painted on the side of the building.


    INT. ROBBIE S RAW BAR - DAY

    Kerry daytime drinking and having lunch.  Looks up as Longworth 
    sits down across from him, without an invitation.                                                                                    46.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    So I figured out who s been 
                    painting on the sides of buildings 
                    around here.

    Kerry looks at him beat, then goes back to eating.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Your brother.

                                  KERRY
                    That s not funny.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I don t mean your brother per se.  
                    I mean someone who loved your 
                    brother.  Who thought he was a hero 
                    worth remembering.  Someone who 
                    looked up to him.  That s who did 
                    it.

                                  KERRY
                    He had a lot of people like that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah, I m not hearing that.  I m 
                    hearing he was kind of a moody 
                    little dipshit.  It s all about 
                    him.  That guy.

                                  KERRY
                    He could be that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Which can put some people off.

    Kerry glances up at that, but right back down to eat.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So here s what I think is going on.  
                    And you tell me where I ve got it 
                    wrong.
                          (beat)
                    You hate tourists.  I mean, who 
                    doesn t, right?  But unlike the 
                    rest of us, you have a really good 
                    reason.  And knowing that, I d be 
                    kind of an idiot not to pursue the 
                      possibility that you lured one of 
                    those annoying assholes into a 
                      situation, killed her, dumped her 
                    body in the swamp, then dragged 
                    poor Erin into it after the fact so 
                    she could witness you  finding  her 
                    headless body, how s that?

    Kerry head down, pushing his food around, listening.                                                                                    47.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Only that s not what happened.  I 
                    mean, you might have done it, I ve 
                    been wrong before.  But I just 
                    don t see it.  See the thing about 
                    murder?  Is you really have to be 
                    able to keep it together to get 
                    away with it, and I don t know, 
                    something about the way a kid like 
                    you with no balls is able to sit 
                    here sawing away at Robbie s 
                    chicken fried steak just doesn t 
                    say to me that three nights ago you 
                    killed a woman and fed her to an 
                      alligator.  And for my deal, if I 
                    have lose ends or something doesn t 
                    fit or add up?  Then I really 
                    haven t eliminated anything.  And 
                    murder is all about elimination.  
                    So while I could be wrong, I just 
                    don t see it.  Now what I do see 
                    you doing is spray painting 
                      Okeechobee whatever the hell on the 
                    side of a few buildings so no one 
                    will forget your brother.  Will you 
                    give me that?

    Kerry looks up.  Stares a beat.

                                  KERRY
                    Okay.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Okay.  Good.  And was it your idea 
                    or your girlfriend s to plaster it 
                    all over the high school?

                                  KERRY
                    She s not my girlfriend.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Not your girlfriend.

                                  KERRY
                    We re just hanging out.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hanging out with a sixteen year 
                    old.

                                  KERRY
                    I mean.  We just.  We were both ... 
                    thinking about him.  I was drunk.  
                    I don t know.  We just wanted to 
                    remember him ...

    Kerry stops, not sure where he stands here.                                                                                    48.



                                  KERRY
                    She told me she checked.  I thought 
                    she was telling me the truth. 

    Longworth lets that worry sit on his head for a beat.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    She was, son.  It s sixteen.

    Implied in his look: someone too lazy to check, he would have 
    caught by now, as Longworth gets up and leaves.  Off Kerry


    EXT. SUGARLOAF STATE PRESERVE - FISHEATING CREEK - DAY

    Smoke rises in a line along the horizon.  Sugar Cane fields in a 
    control burn, wind carrying a mile-long wall of smoke over the 
    cypress preserve.

    Camera finds Longworth watching the acrid smoke drift towards 
    him.  He looks down into brown water.  Insects either side of 
    the surface thrive with the business of eating.  Bubbles escape 
    from below. 

    He walks the crime scene, eyes down as he stomps tall weeds and 
    saw grass, searching through the tangle of cover vegetation.

    As he walks, he sees the detritus of a local hangout - beer and 
    soda cans, crumpled cigarette packs, cigarette butts, wrappers, 
    condoms, lotto scratchers, a slushie cup and straw.

    He stops.  Listens.  Eighteen-wheel truck traffic nearby.  He 
    scans the horizon.  A clearing in the road.

    He starts out on foot, past his sedan, for the highway.


    EXT. SUGARLOAF STATE PRESERVE - U.S. 75 - DAY

    Longworth traipses out of the reed, onto the busy highway.  
    Traffic swishes past.  He looks left, right.  Tracks the chain 
    stores, fast food restaurants and strip malls that line U.S 75.  
    Eyes lock on something just up the road.

    A convenience store.


    EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - MINUTES LATER

    Longworth comes out, gets in his sedan.  Stops.  Sees Jeff and 
    some rough looking, older kids, smoking, jacking around on the 
    side of the building.

    Jeff sees Longworth.  They look at each other.  Jeff takes a 
    long drag from a Camel, blows smoke.  Goes back to his buddies.                                                                                    49.




    INT. TAMPA BAY MEDICAL CENTER - DAY

    Longworth with Callie, at her desk.  Callie applies iodine 
    tincture to his wound, distracted by work, studies ...

                                  CALLIE
                    She bought lotto tickets?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    A blow pop, two Red Bull, a bag of 
                    corn nuts and lotto tickets.

    She redresses his wound as he contemplates their meaning.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He was drunk and passed out - she 
                    had to do something ...

                                  CALLIE
                    She did.
                          (meaning)
                    A blow pop, two Red Bull, a bag of 
                    chips and lotto tickets.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Jeff doesn t drink those does he?

                                  CALLIE
                    Lives on  em.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You know what s in that shit?

                                  CALLIE
                    No.  Do you?  

    Said busy and impatient.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    They make you pee like a race 
                    horse.  Two of  em, she d be up all 
                    night.   

                                  CALLIE
                    I haven t noticed Jeff doing an 
                      inordinate amount of peeing.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Am I bothering you?

                                  CALLIE
                    Yes.  I m busy.  Don t take it 
                      personally.  I have a test on 
                    Monday.

    Finished with his bandage, she returns to her text book.                                                                                    50.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    You clearing me for all activities?

                                  CALLIE
                    That s up to you.

    Longworth testing his grip, taking practice swings.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I don t know.  A sixteen year old 
                    killer?  Statistical long shot.  
                    But she did lie about leaving.  
                    Maybe lied to Kerry - still don t 
                      understand why you guys do that.

                                  CALLIE
                    Because we can.  It s special.  Or 
                    you think so. 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You don t think it s special?

                                  CALLIE
                    I did at the time.  Don t you 
                    remember your first?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You were my first.

    She smirks, back to her studies.  Back to his practice swings.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I saw Jeff.  Hanging with some 
                    older boys.

                                  CALLIE
                    I know his friends, they re okay.  
                    Bored maybe.  I m glad he s got 
                    friends close in age at all.  Was 
                    he smoking?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    No.

                                  CALLIE
                    You wouldn t tell me if he was.  
                    You can t talk Jeff into doing 
                    something he doesn t want to do.  
                    If he s into something wrong, he 
                    got there by himself.  That s the 
                    best you can hope for.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You ve got to read this whole book?

                                  CALLIE
                      Eventually.                                                                                    51.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Maybe I ll take him to a movie.

    She looks up from her reading.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You barely have time for yourself.
                    I m sure he s bored.

                                  CALLIE
                    Look.  Don t police my son.  
                    Neither one of us are huge fans of 
                    your line of work.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I guess I understand that.

    She looks at him, goes back to her book.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What did you decide about Frank? 

                                  CALLIE
                    It s probably worse not to tell 
                    him.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He can t hurt you.

                                  CALLIE
                    My husband is not a guy to clown 
                    around with.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He s not that tough.

                                  CALLIE
                    Yeah he is.

    Callie buried in her studies.  His cell rings, his partner s 
    number and he moves off to answer it.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hey.  You come up with a name?


    EXT. INTERSECTION - U.S. 75 AND INTERLAKE BLVD. - NIGHT

    Erin stands over the shrine.  Stares at it.  When her shadow is 
    joined by another.

                                  LONGWORTH (O.C.)
                    Sucks.

    She turns to see Longworth there.                                                                                    52.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Letting someone go.


    EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

    An amber street light swarming with insects the size of your 
    head throws light down on single car at the far end of the lot.

    Erin alone in Longworth s unmarked sedan.  She watches as he 
    exits the store, walks over, hands her a pack of cigarettes he 
    just bought through the window. 

                                  ERIN
                    Thanks.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Just not in the car.

    She nods, pops in the lighter.  Continues their conversation.

                                  ERIN
                    He was coming to see me that night.  
                    Lane.  He just got off work at 
                    Pizza Hut and I told him to meet me 
                    here.  Had to sneak out cause I was 
                    only fifteen. 

    The lighter pops and she lights her cigarette, blowing smoke as 
    she gets out of the car. 

                                  ERIN
                    I told him to wear his Calvin Klein 
                    cause I didn t want him smellin  
                    like Pizza Hut my first time.  I 
                    was real nervous.  Maybe he was 
                    too, I don t know.  Or maybe his 
                    mind was just elsewhere.

    Longworth watches the young woman smoke.  Doubts his mind was 
    elsewhere.

                                  ERIN
                    I ve never told Kerry this.  But he 
                    and Lane look really alike.  Not in 
                    the face, but like their hands and 
                    the way they sit on a car and their 
                    voice.  It s weird on the phone.  I 
                    thought with Calvin Klein and 
                    whatever, it might seem like it was 
                    him.  Like if Lane hadn t been hit 
                    on his motorcycle that night and we 
                    finally got to do it.  I really 
                    wanted it to be him.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He was a surrogate.                                                                                    53.



                                  ERIN
                    I don t know what that means.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You used Kerry in place of his 
                    brother.

    Erin shrugs yeah I guess ...

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He didn t like that.  Subbing for 
                    his brother.

                                  ERIN
                    Threw a whole brand new bottle of 
                    CK in the creek.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    That why you left?

                                  ERIN
                    Partly.  He was too drunk by then 
                    anyway.  Tried for like fifteen 
                    minutes.  You d think he d stop 
                    drinking but I think trying made 
                    him drink more.  When he passed out 
                    I just left.  Tried to stay gone a 
                    long time.  Went and got my dad his 
                    lotto scratchers.  I was mad, I 
                    guess.  Wanted Kerry to worry about 
                    me.  

    She smokes.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    How long were you gone?

                                  ERIN
                    I don t know.  Hour maybe.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So you left twice?

                                  ERIN
                    No.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Then you were gone a lot longer 
                    than an hour.

    She looks at him.  Smokes.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You came here just after two in the 
                    morning.  Then used the ATM at the 
                    Bank in the strip mall at the other 
                    end of town.                                                                                    54.



                                  ERIN
                    I forgot to get my dad his 
                      scratchers and didn t have enough 
                    money cause I spent what he gave me 
                    on beer for Kerry.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Not that withdrawal, the one you 
                    made for the maximum three hundred 
                    dollars at four-thirty in the 
                    morning.

    Beat.

                                  ERIN
                    I went twice.  I told you I was 
                    trying to make him worry about me.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    If you were so mad at him why 
                    didn t you just go home?

    She smokes, shrugs.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So you still have the money?

                                  ERIN
                    No.  It s gone.  I spent it.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You remember Anna Salazar?  She 
                    sometimes substitute teaches at 
                    your school.  

                                  ERIN
                    No.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah, she served you with detention 
                    for writing Okeechobee Southerners 
                    are Sub Human over her assignment.

    She smokes, shrugs.

                                  ERIN
                    Okay.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    She s missing.

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                      END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    55.



                                          ACT FIVE

    FADE IN:


    EXT. SUGARLOAF STATE PRESERVE - FISHEATING CREEK - DAY

    Longworth toes debris inside the area cordoned off by police 
    tape.  Looks out over the water.

    He steps to a clearing of cattail and saw grass at the edge of 
    the creek.  A dead fish floats on the surface, rotting.  Small 
    fish and minnow, feeding off its murky residue.

    He leans over the water to look closer.  Sees something just 
    past it on the creek bed, grabs a limb overhead for support and 
    reaches in to grab it.

    A full, unopened bottle of Calvin Klein for Men.

    Longworth regains his balance.  Looks at the impression left in 
    the muck by the soles of his shoes.  The bank nearby, tacky and 
    matted down flat.

    His interest broken by a whoop of excitement, looks over to see 

    Jeff on the shore, a small brim wiggling at the end of a fishing 
    line.  He approaches as Jeff swings his catch out of the water.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m impressed.  I was told there 
                    weren t any fish in this creek.

                                  JEFF
                    Got lucky, I guess.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What kind of fish is that?

                                  JEFF
                    Brim.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Thought you said fishing was gay?

    Jeff grins at the small fish, wriggling at the end of his line.

                                  JEFF
                    Aren t I contaminating a crime 
                    scene?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You re helping me interview 
                      witnesses.

    Longworth nods, meaning the fish.                                                                                    56.



                                  JEFF
                    He doesn t look like he saw much.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Thank him for his time and send him 
                    on his way.

    Jeff unhooks the fish, releases it back into the water.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    How much do you weigh?

    ANGLE ON THE CREEK

    The opening in the creek, the rotting fish.  Find Longworth, 
    carrying Jeff in his arms, hefting his weight as he stomps down 
    grass and reeds, hauling Jeff from the road to the opening in 
    the creek.

    He stands at the clearing, holding Jeff.

                                  JEFF
                    Okay.  This is gay.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You re supposed to be dead.

    Jeff falls quiet as Longworth looks around, trying to figure out 
    how to settle Jeff into the water without making a lot of noise.

    He hefts the boy repeatedly, strains at the effort, his feet and 
    legs shifting to accommodate their combined weight --

    He steps into the creek shallows, sinks quickly to mid-thigh.  
    Another step and he d be in over his head.  The strain of weight 
    now transferred to his back, when his cell phone chirps.

                                  JEFF
                    You re getting a call.

    Longworth holding the kid, his cell chirping, he quickly sloshes 
    back onto the shore, stands there thinking.

      A different chirp, someone left him a text message.  He sets 
    Jeff down, back aching for the effort, checks the text message.

                                  JEFF
                    The dental records a match?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Don t know what you re talking 
                    about.

                                  JEFF
                    Right.  Sorry.                                                                                    57.



    Their little secret.  Longworth stretching out his aching lower 
    back, reads then clears this message --

                                  LONGWORTH
                     Don t forget the beer .


    EXT. OGLETREE HOUSE - BACK YARD

    Ogletree grilling burgers.  He and Longworth with beers, waving 
    off smoke as they deal with a fresh development.

                                  OGLETREE
                    So the teacher s not missing.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Ran off with some guy.  Husband was 
                    pissed I even called.  Told me to 
                    shove his wife s dental records up 
                    my ass.

                                  OGLETREE
                    The girl still lied.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah.  Sometimes they do that.

    Beat.  Longworth hoists his beer to their Sunday ritual.

                                  LONGWORTH
                      Appreciate you keeping our streak 
                    alive.

                                  OGLETREE
                    It s just burgers.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Under the circumstances, I would ve 
                      understood.  I know I ve been 
                    treating you like my secretary. 

                                  OGLETREE
                    We got the jaw bone.  I ll stay on 
                    it.

    Ogletree not happy.  Back aching, clearly feeling under 
    appreciated.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You know, you might feel better if 
                    you get out whatever it is that s 
                    bothering you.

    Ogletree takes a beat.  Not very good at the feelings thing.                                                                                    58.



                                  OGLETREE
                    The thing is.  Well.  I never 
                    intended to play this card.  I 
                    mean, yeah, we re partners, but 
                      technically, with seniority, I am 
                    your supervisor.  Your boss.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I guess I know that.

                                  OGLETREE
                    I ve given you an awful lot of 
                    latitude.  Too much, maybe.  How 
                    else was I supposed to evaluate 
                    your worthiness?  But hell, you 
                    won t even wear the uniform.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I wear the badge.  
                          (off his look)
                    You know, in spirit.

                                  OGLETREE
                    I ve been doing a good job here for 
                    a long time.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m just trying to work in.

                                  OGLETREE
                    I m having trouble with that.  You 
                    being here.  I can t say it s fair 
                    for either one of us.  Why should I 
                    feel like I m not up to the job?  

    Ogletree presses the burgers.  Trying to get this out.

                                  OGLETREE
                    And I mean, ordinarily, in the 
                    middle of such a high stakes event, 
                    this is not an action I would 
                      ordinarily take.  But I mean.  Well 
                    we tried.  I don t know what else 
                    to say about it.  We tried.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What are you doing?

                                  OGLETREE
                    I m trying to tell you it s not 
                    working out.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I mean to the meat.  You re 
                    smashing the burgers, that dries 
                     em out.                                                                                    59.



    Ogletree takes a beat.  Aggravated by the pain in his back.  
    Which Longworth goes after ...

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Something throw your back out, 
                    Mike?

    Another beat.  Ogletree goes back to the burgers.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Look, I appreciate you telling me 
                    how you feel.  I know you and Janet 
                    are fighting and I know that s not 
                    easy for you.  But you can t really 
                    expect me to be sloppy just so you 
                    can feel good about yourself.

    Ogletree takes a beat.  Smashes the burgers.  Juices escape amid 
    sizzle and flame.  A long beat.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Burgers are done.

    But neither man moves for the burgers.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    When s Janet coming home?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Janice.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Janice?  Really?

                                  OGLETREE
                    She didn t say.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    She didn t say.
                          (beat)
                    She must really be mad at you.

    A long beat, during which Ogletree does not respond.

                                  OGLETREE
                    I need to chop an onion.

    Ogletree heads for the house.  Longworth watches his partner 
    disappear inside.


    INT. OGLETREE KITCHEN - DAY

    Ogletree grabs an onion and a chopping board.  Opens a drawer, 
    fishes around for a knife, then stops.  

    He moves to another drawer.  Opens it slowly and looks inside.                                                                                      60.




    EXT. OGLETREE HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

    Longworth has the meat off the grill, fanning off flies.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Better get to these quick.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Do you even carry your service 
                    revolver?

    Longworth stops.  Turns to see Ogletree with a gun on him.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Wasn t one in your vehicle, I 
                    looked.

    There is a beat.  Longworth getting that he s pretty fucked.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    It s Sunday, Mike.  What do I need 
                    a gun for?

                                  OGLETREE
                    You got my wife s dental records?  
                    Without telling me.  What kind of 
                    cop looks into his partner without 
                    telling him?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Your wife was missing.

    Ogletree looks at him.  Guess he sees his point.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So what are we going to do?

                                  OGLETREE
                    I killed my wife.  Mutilated the 
                    woman I slept next to for sixteen 
                    years, you think I won t shoot you?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m kind of hoping you won t.

                                  OGLETREE
                    I mean, look at you, you dress like 
                    a clown.  Treat the job like an 
                      inconvenience.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    It is kind of a pain in the ass.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Why should I take shit from you?                                                                                    61.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Cause I m a better cop than you.

    There is a beat.  Ogletree almost laughing as he tries to find 
    his footing.

                                  OGLETREE
                    I tried, Jim.  I really did.  
                    Things didn t always suck between 
                    us, you know.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    That wasn t my intention.

                                  OGLETREE
                    I meant between me and Janice.

    Longworth studies his partner.  The gun he hasn t shot yet.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What happened?

                                  OGLETREE
                      Everything happened.  I mean.  I 
                    lost my confidence.  Lost my one 
                    good thing here at home.  Tired of 
                    hearing about you every night.  Got 
                    so bad I didn t know where I wanted 
                    to be.  Didn t wanna be at home, 
                    didn t wanna be at work.  Have you 
                    ever not wanted to be anywhere? 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Here.  I hate it here.  But the 
                    golf is great - and I think I might 
                    have met someone.  She has a son 
                    and is married to a guy in prison.  
                    So we ll have to see how that goes.

    The two men look at each other.  Ogletree struggling.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Maybe you could give me an hour?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    How s that again?

                                  OGLETREE
                    So I don t have to shoot you.  

    Longworth looks at Ogletree.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You wouldn t get very far.

    Ogletree starting to agitate.  Then realizes why Longworth is 
    being so cavalier.                                                                                    62.



    His back yard has quietly been crept up on by a dozen Highway 
    Patrol personnel.  Guns trained on Ogletree.  

    A long beat.  Ogletree s shoulders slump slightly.  


    EXT. PALM HARBOR COUNTRY CLUB - FAIRWAY - DAY

    CLOSE on a Titleist, sitting up in the fairway as we WIDEN to 
    find Carlos balling up the now-stripped away Crime Scene Tape.

    Longworth pulls a club, sets up to strike his ball.

                                  CARLOS
                    Did he say why?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Not really.  He blamed me.

                                  CARLOS
                    I can see him doing that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Right.  I m so hard to work with a 
                    man killed his wife.

                                  CARLOS
                    You are.

    Longworth strikes the ball, nice and crisp.  They watch it land 
    softly on the green about a hundred and forty yards away.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    See that?  Over your rudeness, and 
                    I still punch it up there.


    EXT. PALM HARBOR COUNTRY CLUB - VARIOUS - DAY

    Various shots, as Longworth splits fairways and drops putts on 
    his quest to break eighty.  Sequence ends with his approach shot 
    on eighteen landing thirty feet short of the green.


    EXT. PALM HARBOR COUNTRY CLUB - EIGHTEENTH GREEN

    Longworth makes a show of repairing ball marks.

                                  CARLOS
                    Those aren t even yours.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    They re in my line.

                                  CARLOS
                    Only if you hit the sweetest shot 
                    of your entire life.                                                                                    63.



    Longworth jogs back to his ball, takes a couple of practice 
    swings, address and then hits it, blading it a little.  

    The ball rolls twelve feet past the cup.


    EXT. PALM HARBOR COUNTRY CLUB - EIGHTEENTH GREEN - DAY

    Longworth stalks his twelve-foot putt, checking it from every 
    angle, kneeling, squinting.  Then gets over his putt.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    If I make this and break eighty.  
                    You re not going to kill your wife 
                    are you?

                                  CARLOS
                    And give you the satisfaction of 
                    arresting me?

    He takes a couple of smooth, sweeping practice putts.  Sets up, 
    eyes his line, then pulls back and strokes the ball.

    It singes the cup on the outside, rolls past four feet.

                                  CARLOS
                    Yeah, baby.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Are you kidding me?  I miss and 
                    you re happy?  You re an asshole.

                                  CARLOS
                    Why am I an asshole?

                                  LONGWORTH
                      I wouldn t be like Yeah baby if you 
                    blew a chance to break eighty ...

    Longworth goes to pick up his ball.

                                  CARLOS
                    Whoa, whoa.  What are you doing?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You re not gonna give me that?

                                  CARLOS
                    It s four feet.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You won t give me that for eighty?

                                  CARLOS
                    Not four feet.                                                                                    64.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Are you an asshole now?

    He putts the ball.  But before it hits the hole --

                                  CALLIE (V.O.)
                    An eighty-one?


    EXT. ROBBIE S RAW BAR - DAY

    Callie with Longworth, at the bar, sipping long necks.

                                  CALLIE
                    You three putted the last hole?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Burned the edge on the outside, 
                    rolled five feet past.  He gave me 
                    that one.

                                  CALLIE
                    A gimmie eighty-one.  Wow.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I feel okay about it.  My game is 
                    in good shape, left a few shots out 
                    there, but that s golf.  I feel 
                    okay.

                                  CALLIE
                    You watch too much Golf Channel. 

    Longworth noticing a guy at a booth checking Callie out.

                                  CALLIE
                    Thanks for taking Jeff fishing.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Sure.

                                  CALLIE
                    His father never did anything like 
                    that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Well he was trying to put a roof 
                    over his family s head.  You know, 
                    by stealing things that didn t 
                    belong to him.

                                  CALLIE
                    I m not making excuses.  I knew 
                    what he was doing.  I didn t like 
                    it, and I told him so.  But I knew 
                    what he was doing.                                                                                    65.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    You could have left him.

                                  CALLIE
                    I could have.  But I didn t.  Then 
                    I didn t have to.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You wouldn t be the first woman to 
                    divorce a man in prison.

                                  CALLIE
                    Yeah, but then I m the woman who 
                    divorced her husband in prison. 

    She looks at him to see if he gets that. 

                                  CALLIE
                    There was good in Frank once.  
                    Maybe this is bottom for him.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Odds are not in favor of that being 
                    the case.

                                  CALLIE
                    Odds don t get any better if I 
                    divorce him. 

    Which puts her in a difficult place.  A point he considers.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I should go.

                                  CALLIE
                    I thought he was meeting you here.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    The lucky candidate?  He got here 
                    about twenty minutes ago.

    Callie confused - then figures out what he did when she looks to 
    see the guy in the booth who s been checking her out.

                                  CALLIE
                    You ll never find a partner that 
                    way.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Not a good one.

    As he rises to leave ...

                                  CALLIE
                    It s Jeff s weekend with his 
                    grandma.                                                                                      66.



    They look at each other.  A beat that quickly fills with 
    promise.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Give me an hour to see what this 
                    joker has to offer?

    She glances at the guy - who remarkably is still checking her 
    out.

                                  CALLIE
                    An hour is generous.

    Longworth throws some bills down and we FOLLOW him to the booth, 
    where he introduces himself.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Randy Cromwell?

                                  CROMWELL
                    Yeah?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Jim Longworth.

    The guy looks at Longworth, knows now he was checking out his 
    lady friend.

                                  CROMWELL
                    Jim.  Nice to meet you. 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Thanks for driving up.

                                  CROMWELL
                    Yeah, I got here a little early ...

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah, I noticed that.

    Longworth slides in on the other side.  Cromwell knows he s 
    already fucked.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So you want to be my partner?

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                            THE END
