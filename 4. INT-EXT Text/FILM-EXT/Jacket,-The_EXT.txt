A NEWSANCHOR interviews CAPTAIN ROBERT MEDLEY (30s) -- a
particularly photogenic and affable participant.
CAPTAIN MEDLEY
The level of arms on the ground
really depends. [Answering a
question] But no, I'd have to say we
haven't had to engage on the ground
as heavily as we might have expected.
NEWSANCHOR
Have you lost any men today, Captain?
CAPTAIN MEDLEY
No. One of my Corporals took a bullet
to the head, but it looks like he
might make it. Looks that way...
FLASHBACK TO:
3.
We see only the HAND, and not the man to whom it belongs,
enter the frame and pull the TRIGGER on a gun. The sound
pierces the air, and the bullet hits the side of STARKS' head
in a FLASH, shaving the skin around it right off.
STARKS convalesces in a navy hospital bed -- his head heavily
BANDAGED and his arms suited with I.V.'s and dressings -- as a
MAJOR, a LIEUTENANT and a DOCTOR stand above him.
STARKS' face -- now cleaned of the blood that masked it before --
is alert, and striking. Even with the bandages, he remains
well-built and strong, like a shot straight to the head would
have been the only way for an enemy to take him down.
DOCTOR
Sergeant Starks was very lucky. A
little more to the right and it
wouldn't have wanted to come out...
MAJOR
But he's never gonna be able to
remember what happened?
DOCTOR
It's hard to say. Sergeant Starks
could have retrograde amnesia
or... [lowering his voice] any form of
psychological suppression. It's very
common with traumas like this.
STARKS [Cutting him off]
Sergeant Starks is in the room,
[beat] and I want to know when I'm
going home.
When he speaks, STARKS maintains the sharp, steady gaze of a
man assured of himself, even if he is lost among his
surroundings.
LIEUTENANT
Sergeant, you have no surviving
family in the States. I'm sure you
have friends or distant relatives,
but unfortunately we have no record
of them yet.
MAJOR
Captain Medley has recommended you
for the Purple Heart, Sergeant.
4.
STARKS lets the tribute roll right off him. He spots the
CIGARETTES in the Lieutenant's pocket.
STARKS
Can I have one of those?
LIEUTENANT
Of course.
The LIEUTENANT lights one for him.
DOCTOR
There is help for you, Sergeant.
LIEUTENANT
Of course there is.
Their VOICES start to fade as STARKS smokes his cigarette,
blowing the SMOKE upwards and following it with his eyes.
He's finished with these men and everything they stand for.
STARKS [V.O.]
I didn't know where my home was. I
just knew I didn't want to be there
anymore.
STARKS -- recovered now -- walks by himself along a long
highway. He seems to be walking away from things even if he
can't remember what they are yet.
JEAN PRICE (30s) -- a hippie who happens to be a mother -- and
her daughter, JACKIE (8) tremble in the cold next to their
stalled car. JEAN sits next to the car, holding her knees to
her chest, more like a child than her daughter.
JACKIE runs her little gloved hand over her mom's ski-hatted
head as she cautiously watches STARKS approach them. He cuts
an arresting figure against the empty landscape.
JACKIE
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
STARKS
You two ok?
JACKIE
Our car won't start.
5.
STARKS [Looking at JEAN]
What's your mom's name?
JACKIE [Cautiously]
Jean.
STARKS takes off his backpack and kneels down.
STARKS
Jean? Jean, can you hear me? I need
you to try to wake up, Jean.
JEAN opens her eyes, stone red.
STARKS
Your mom take anything before this
happened?
JACKIE
Yeah, but I don't know what.
STARKS
[Beat] What's your name?
JACKIE
Jackie.
JACKIE decidedly sticks out her gloved hand. STARKS smiles
and briefly shakes it. STARKS rubs a hand over his chin and
cheek as he thinks of what to do.
STARKS
Nice to meet you, Jackie. Why don't
you wrap this scarf around yourself
and try to keep your mom awake while
I take a look at your car.
As Starks works on their engine, JACKIE anxiously watches her
mother throw up in the distance. STARKS sees her watching and
tries to distract her.
STARKS
What do you think of all this snow?
JACKIE looks at him curiously.
JACKIE
[Beat] Nothing.
STARKS looks at her and smiles at her honest answer; Jackie
turns her head back towards her mother.
6.
JACKIE
But I like it I guess.
STARKS
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
JACKIE
Yeah.
JACKIE gets behind the wheel, crouching down in the seat just
enough so her foot reaches the pedal.
STARKS
Go ahead, turn it on. Keep pushing
it.
JACKIE revs up the engine and, a few coughs and sputters
later, the car settles into a nice, working hum.
JACKIE [Smiling]
It works!
JACKIE steps down. She looks like she could hug Starks and,
unexpectedly, decides to. As STARKS awkwardly returns it, he
sees JEAN lifting her eyes to see him holding her daughter.
JEAN
Get your fucking hands off my
daughter!
JACKIE
Mom, he just fixed our car.
JEAN
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
JEAN reaches for a RIFLE in the back of the truck but
stumbles from the nausea before she can pick it up.
JEAN
Look, I don't want any trouble, so...
STARKS
Neither do I, ma'am. I'll be on my
way.
JACKIE
Mom, you've got it wrong...
STARKS motions for JACKIE to stop as he collects his bags.
JACKIE
You're just gonna walk?
7.
STARKS
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something.
[Beat] Let her throw it all up before
she gets back behind the wheel.
STARKS' DOG TAGS are tied to the ZIPPER of one of his bags.
JACKIE
What're those?
STARKS
Dog tags. [Off her blank look]
They've got your name and date of
birth for identification.
JACKIE
What for?
STARKS
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't
remember who you are.
JACKIE [Still looking at them]
Hm.
STARKS unties them and gives them to her. She reads them.
STARKS
I think I can remember what's on
them.
JACKIE
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
CUT TO:
STARKS lies bleeding -- eyes half open -- by OFFICER HARRISON'S
dead, bloodied body as falling SNOW slowly whitens them both
and covers any FOOTPRINTS that may have been left behind. We
hear a distant gavel delivering a distant judgment...
STARKS [V.O., nearly whispered]
I don't know how it happened.
STARKS' eyes finally close as he lapses into unconsciousness.
In his mind, STARKS is walking out of the woods as the sun
sets and bounces off the snow all around him. We see JACKIE
watching him walk away into the woods.
JUDGE (O.S.)
I hereby sentence you to be committed
to a facility for the criminally
insane, where I hope that doctors and
the proper treatment can help you...
A white VAN pulls up to Alpine Grove Psychiatric Hospital -- a
bleak, dated facility embellished only by the barbed wire
that seems to be everywhere around it.
11.
STARKS' anatomy instantly and intensely separates him from
the staff of the hospital and the infirm patients who might
be in it. TWO MEMBERS of that STAFF lead him in.
JUDGE [O.S.]
Mr. Starks, I hope that someday you
might be well so that we will have
lost only one life in this tragedy.
STARKS sits, totally disoriented, in the ward with the other,
more vocally INSANE patients. He runs his hand uncertainly
over the SCARS on his arm from the Jacket and looks around --
not knowing where his PARANOIA ends and REALITY begins.
The OLD MAN from the previous day is moving slowly with the
aid of his walker. He is far less threatening to STARKS
today...just a senile man about to walk into a wall.
STARKS [Getting up to help him]
Let's get you a destination other
than this wall.
RUDY MACKENZIE -- 40s, smart eyes, fidgety, with an innocent
face -- watches STARKS help turn the OLD MAN around.
MACKENZIE
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears
us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to
bother answering so he makes us think
he can't talk. I know. I tried it on
my mother for two months once before
she fished out my tongue. Literally.
[Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
STARKS
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
MACKENZIE
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy
gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking
out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
(MORE)
19.
MACKENZIE (cont'd)
Welcome to the village, William
Starks.
STARKS doesn't offer his hand, just looks back at MacKenzie.
STARKS [Looking away]
I'm not really in the mood to talk.
MACKENZIE
That's too bad. I don't believe in
disposable language either -- you
know, the small talk, the little
talk. Chit. Chat. Useless. The game's
something else though. Think about
it: What can we trade with each other
in the air between us? This...
[running his hand through the air] is
our court. [Beat, so eager it's sad]
I'm ready to throw the ball. Come on.
STARKS looks at MACKENZIE and sees that the constant flow of
words from his mouth only masks the tragic hesitation in his
eyes. A dead arm hangs limply by his side, like a weight.
STARKS [Relenting]
What are you in here for?
MACKENZIE
I tried to kill my wife.
STARKS
Don't you go to jail for that?
MACKENZIE
I tried something like 30 times.
There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to
that.
MACKENZIE
She's bigger than me, and she's
stronger than me. And I never planned
on doing it. It was always in the
heat of the moment. I didn't beat her
or anything. Hell, she beat me. But
when we'd start fighting, I'd go for
the knife. Then she kept threatening
to have me put away, and [looking
around] she finally did.
As he talks, MACKENZIE notes the SCARS on Starks' arms. Dr.
LORENSON observes STARKS and MACKENZIE talking and starts
walking towards them.
20.
STARKS
Yeah, well 30 times probably would
make you seem crazy.
MACKENZIE
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by
the twentieth time, I'd have found an
alternative method. Maybe a more
effective one, if you know what I
mean.
DR. LORENSON
Morning, gentlemen. How are you doing
today?
MACKENZIE winks discreetly at STARKS before he replies.
MACKENZIE
It's a hard one for me, Dr. Lorenson.
[Finally turns to face her, grimly]
The world around me, it's shrinking.
There's not even room for light to
make its way in. [Beat] Da-da-bum! Da-
da-bum! I feel like the horseman of
doom is coming for me, Doc. Only
today, he's not carrying flowers.
LORENSON reprimands MacKenzie by turning to Starks.
MACKENZIE
What? It's better than fine.
DR. LORENSON
And you, Mr. Starks?
STARKS [Already on the defense]
I'm fine.
DR. LORENSON
Mr. MacKenzie, do you think I could
talk to Mr. Starks privately?
MACKENZIE
Of course you can, Doc. William, it
was an absolute pleasure. Thanks for
playing.
Just before he walks away, MACKENZIE turns around nervously
and uncharacteristically looks STARKS right in the eye.
21.
MACKENZIE
Hey...when they talk you out to the
woods tonight and invite the wolves,
dance with them. [Beat] They don't
eat you when there's music playing.
STARKS looks at MacKenzie briskly, wondering if his words
were directed or just the meandering of a nut. But MacKenzie
just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away --
dead arm in tow.
DR. LORENSON
So you're ok?
STARKS [Still distracted]
What?
DR. LORENSON
I asked you if you're ok.
STARKS [Suspiciously]
I don't know. You tell me, Doc. You
think there's anything wrong with me?
DR. LORENSON
I don't know. You're not my patient.
STARKS looks away. Lorenson gives him a once over.
DR. LORENSON
You look like you've lost some
weight. Are you eating?
STARKS
I am. One of the few things I
remember doing is eating. So I guess
I must be exercising it off in my
dreams.
STARKS looks at LORENSON, seeing if he'll respond. LORENSON
looks back curiously at STARKS' pointed stare.
STARKS
You done with your small talk?
DR. LORENSON
Sure.
STARKS
Good.
STARKS walks away slowly and WEAKLY -- a fact that doesn't
escape LORENSON's observation.
22.
The SOUNDS of BOMBS RAGE around him but he's in the middle of
the murder scene, watching OFFICER HARRISON lie on the floor.
He turns to look over his shoulder and sees...
27.
Through a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN NIGHT-VISION CAMERA, we see FIRE,
FLESH, and RUIN littering the sand. Slowly the
terrifying images shift to a naturalistic, real-time
documentation of the action -- the ruin -- as it's occurring.
As STARKS blinks, TEARS fall and he hears, over it all, a
counseling voice...
MACKENZIE (O.S.)
When they take you out to the woods
tonight and invite the wolves, dance
with them.
The TERRIBLE SOUNDS become less terrible as they fade away.
MACKENZIE (O.S.)
They don't eat you when there's music
playing.
The scene morphs slowly and the following IMAGES appear
vaguely -- forming the walls of the TUNNEL around him.
1) C.U. A WOMAN'S NECK and a small child's HAND
STARKS walks up uneasily to the wall and touches the IMAGES.
They move like they're liquid and, when they settle, the
whole wall is replaced with one large IMAGE of a BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN -- a waitress -- standing at the counter of a COFFEE
SHOP, moving a STRAND OF HAIR out of her face with her hand.
STARKS blinks slowly -- struck by this dream of her. He reaches
out and closes his PALM around her like he might catch hold
of the moment with this simple gesture.
The whole WALL OF IMAGES twinkles marvelously, as we...
CUT TO:
28.
The WAITRESS (early 20s) -- tired, with kind eyes, soft skin
and a beautiful mouth that hasn't smiled in a long time --
emerges from the diner. Even with no effort, she is
remarkably pretty.
From her UNIFORM, we know that her day was spent there.
STARKS simply stares at this WOMAN who seems markedly removed
from the world around her. The only fact she wears on her is
that she's tired.
She spots STARKS and can't help but do a double-take. Both
are momentarily taken with each other, though she tries to
hide any indication that she is.
The WAITRESS treads angrily towards STARKS.
WAITRESS
Where do you think you're going?
STARKS looks at her. He doesn't know anymore than she does.
WAITRESS
You gonna answer me?
STARKS just stares.
WAITRESS
If you're deaf, read my lips...I
don't need a psycho following me
today.
STARKS
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
WAITRESS
Good.
She turns and gets back in her car, slamming the door shut.
She starts to drive and STARKS stares after her.
29.
After a few hundred yards, she SLAMS on the brakes and turns
the car round, coming back. Then she jumps out of the car and
heads back in the diner, without looking over at STARKS.
She comes out -- this time PURSE in hand -- and sighs at
Starks.
WAITRESS
[As if she owes him an explanation] I
forgot my purse.
STARKS nods slowly. The WAITRESS gets in her car and looks
again at STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR. He has hardly any
winter gear on him -- no gloves, no hat, no coat -- just jeans
and a flannel. He looks lost among his surroundings, as much
because he doesn't know where he is as because he doesn't
look like he belongs there.
She reverses towards him.
WAITRESS
In case you hadn't figured, it's
Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get
a cab here.
STARKS
[Beat] Thanks.
She looks him over and then rests her hands on the wheel.
WAITRESS
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere
you need to go, Mister?
STARKS
I'm not sure.
WAITRESS
Let me ask you that again. This time,
look around and consider your
options.
Being cold and freezing are his options.
WAITRESS
[Beat] You got somewhere you need to
go, Mister?
STARKS [Nodding slowly]
Yeah, I do.
30.
WAITRESS
Great, get in.
STARKS, still without a coat, collects some WOOD...
34.
Again, we're glimpsing the scene through PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN
NIGHT VISION intermittently negotiated with real-time images.
Opposite Starks stands a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER -- seething in
anger and pointing his gun at a LITTLE BOY, presumably
belonging to the MAN not five feet away. Next to Starks is an
angry CAPTAIN MEDLEY, ordering STARKS to follow him. STARKS
is watching himself in the scene.
MEDLEY
You walk on. They pick up their guns
and fire at you, you stay. They pick
up and fire at each other, and you
walk on!
STARKS
He's got his gun pointed at a kid.
MEDLEY
That is not our problem.
STARKS
Yeah, well, none of this is our
fuckin' problem.
STARKS turns and aims his gun at a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER
threatening to shoot a child. We hear him YELLING in Arabic.
What STARKS doesn't see is another IRAQI SOLDIER (2) aiming
his GUN at STARKS.
MEDLEY
We are leaving this site right now.
STARKS doesn't hear him; he's busy perfecting his aim.
STARKS [To the first Iraqi soldier]
Hey!
At the force of the word, the SOLDIER lowers his gun and the
LITTLE BOY flees.
STARKS, who is now in the scene himself, lowers his gun
slightly as he approaches the SOLDIER. Neither speaks the
other's language but they're both saying everything with
their eyes. Neither moves his off the other.
Just then, though, we see the SECOND IRAQI SOLDIER get a
clear aim at STARKS.
46.
He takes his SHOT before anyone else does. STARKS goes down
as the skin off the side of his head is shaved off.
He falls to the ground. As the rest of the picture fades to
black, all that is left is previously mysterious, still
haunting PAIR of EYES that we now see belonged to the
CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER.
And over it all is the now more distant CLANK OF METAL as the
drawer is opened and the nightmare momentarily ended...
FADE TO BLACK.
LORENSON [Calling out after him]
Dr. Becker! Dr. Becker!...Tom, wait!
DR. BECKER stops walking and waits a moment, registering the
voice, before he turns around to face Dr. Lorenson.
LORENSON [Out of breath]
Where's William Starks?
BECKER
He's recovering on the third floor.
LORENSON
Are you kidding me? He's not
psychotic!
BECKER
Then how would you describe him,
Beth? Merely rebellious?
LORENSON
He'll be a zombie in a few days, Tom.
His behavior's hardly suggested he
needed neuroleptics.
48.
BECKER
And you know that from what, a couple
two-minute stares across a room?
LORENSON [Firmly]
He didn't need anti-psychotics, if
that's even all you're giving him...?
BECKER ignores Lorenson's insinuation and merely turns his
CHEEK all the way round towards Lorenson so he can see the
BANDAGE from the CUT Starks gave him.
BECKER [Steadily]
After he slashed me with a hospital
instrument, I determined, in my
professional opinion, that Mr.
Starks, needed a little placating.
LORENSON
[Beat] You sure he wasn't provoked?
BECKER
You sure you want to begin making
that kind of insinuation? [Beat] I
took five stitches during a routine
therapy session.
LORENSON
I'm sure he took some, too.
BECKER [Smirking, unphased]
Happens sometimes when you've got to
restrain them. You watch the rest of
us work. You know that.
LORENSON [Appealing to him]
Our patients are sick.
BECKER
Yes, they are.
LORENSON looks at BECKER; he knows he's hiding something.
LORENSON
He's not gonna end up like Casey,
Tom. Whatever happened to him is not
going to "happen" to Starks. I don't
know what you're trying to do here
...but he's not a lab animal, Tom.
You can't reprogram him no matter the
drugs or the treatment.
49.
BECKER
Jesus, you really don't let up, do
you? Just because you failed your
patient doesn't necessarily mean the
rest of us did, too. [Beat] Sorry to
tarnish your war hero's image, but he
is psychotic.
LORENSON looks back, starting to grasp Becker's misshapen
beliefs.
BECKER
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's
Christmas, and I have a family I'd
like to see.
STARKS leans down -- seemingly oblivious to the cold -- and
lifts some snow to his mouth, TASTING it like a man who needs
to affirm he is still alive. He's so rapt that LORENSON's
VOICE takes him by surprise.
LORENSON
Hey. You're not supposed to be out
here.
STARKS stiffens as he realizes he could be in the place where
his body was found. The terrible question asks itself on his
face: Is this when Starks is killed?
STARKS [Turning around sharply]
What are you going to do to me?
LORENSON
Well...
As LORENSON reaches into his POCKET for something, STARKS
anxiously holds his breath. It's BLACK when it comes out and...
a SKI HAT when it opens up. STARKS lets out his breath,
relieved.
56.
LORENSON [Nonchalantly]
I thought I'd just ask you to come
back inside with me.
STARKS
And if I didn't want to come?
LORENSON
I guess I'd ask you why.
STARKS
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
LORENSON
You're not crazy.
STARKS is surprised by Lorenson's agreement.
LORENSON
You suffer from delusional disorder.
That doesn't mean you're... crazy. It
just means you're confused. And
you're here, instead of in jail,
because that was determined to have
played a role in your killing of a
police officer.
STARKS [Correcting him]
Alleged killing of a police officer.
LORENSON
You were convicted of the crime.
STARKS
That conviction doesn't convince me
of anything. Until I know that I did
it, I'm not going to accept that I
did.
LORENSON
You may never remember at all. [Beat]
Your mind's grasp of reality and the
real events that have happened to you
has been damaged.
STARKS
No. The real events that have
happened to me have been fucked up.
Not my mind.
LORENSON seems to realize -- at least for an instant -- that he
is looking at a desperate man who is persuasively, and
cogently, staring back at him.
57.
LORENSON
[Beat] William, I'd like to ask you
something if I can.
STARKS
Since when do people around here have
to ask permission to do anything?
LORENSON [Suspiciously]
How's your treatment progressing with
Dr. Becker?
STARKS still doesn't know how much Lorenson knows, and if he
should trust him.
STARKS
Fine. [Beat] Why made you ask?
LORENSON answers first with his eyes looking over Starks'
body. STARKS merely stares back tersely.
LORENSON [Carefully]
I just hope you'd let me know if that
wasn't the case.
STARKS
Why, what would you do?
LORENSON
I could try to...make it stop.
STARKS
No. I don't want it to.
LORENSON
So it's helping?
STARKS [Choosing his words carefully]
[Beat] It's making me feel like a
different person.
LORENSON -- sensing she's not going to get any more from
Starks -- turns around to go back inside. It's only as she
turns her face away from STARKS that we see how nervous she
is. But you'd never guess it from her tone...
LORENSON [Casually]
You comin'?
STARKS looks towards the FENCES locking him in from every
direction. LORENSON waits until she hears STARKS' FOOTSTEPS
following her. She waits until STARKS has reached her.
58.
LORENSON
You should be careful. You could be
killed if they found you out here.
STARKS
Believe me, I know.
STARKS and TENNY -- 30s, shifty, a total stranger -- sit in
silence in TENNY'S CAR. (We recognize the murder scene.) RED
POLICE LIGHTS FLASH in the rearview mirror though STARKS
doesn't see them yet.
STARKS and TENNY are talking to one another. TENNY's voice
takes a dangerous tone.
TENNY
You ever been to jail?
STARKS
No.
TENNY nods, distracting STARKS long enough to slip a hand
down his leg to the GUN he's hidden there.
TENNY
It's worse than war. It's worse than
anywhere you've ever been.
STARKS
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think
prison's so bad you don't want to
remember it...
TENNY carefully pulls over to the side of the road, assured
and cautious with each word, each move.
TENNY
Well, I've never been to war, but I'm
sure as hell not going back to
prison.
STARKS [Finally spotting Harrison]
What's he pulling us over for?
TENNY [Still preparing himself]
Recreation.
OFFICER HARRISON walks up to their car.
OFFICER HARRISON
Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you to step
out of the car, with your hands at
your side please.
STARKS
Why?
68.
OFFICER HARRISON [Sternly]
Step out of the car.
STARKS
Ok, sir. I was just asking what for.
OFFICER HARRISON
This is a stolen vehicle you're
driving. Now put your hands in the
air, out where I can see 'em.
That's the second when OFFICER HARRISON sees where TENNY'S
HAND is. As he reaches for his own GUN, the situation
explodes as TWO FLASHES eclipse all else. OFFICER HARRISON
goes down, still holding his own GUN and STARKS jumps out of
the car to check on him.
STARKS
Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for?
TENNY looks around, still holding the GUN. Starks swallows,
assessing whether to back away or not. TENNY waves his gun as
he half points it in Harrison's direction. Then, GUN still in
hand, he smirks nervously and looks at STARKS.
TENNY
Man, if you're so deaf and dumb, you
ain't even worth a fucking bullet.
TENNY raises the gun, then aims it away from STARKS and
shoots OFFICER HARRISON once more. From the ground, OFFICER
HARRISON fires back and STARKS, now lunging at Tenny, TAKES
THE HIT.
STARKS falls, clearly unable to get up, let alone pursue
anyone. TENNY smiles sardonically and slowly puts the GUN in
his back pocket as he turns to leave. This SMILE was one of
the eerie FLASHES that haunted Starks in the JACKET...
STARKS struggles but can't move. That's when he passes out,
looking at OFFICER HARRISON from the ground, as he did in the
scene before.
STARKS and JACKIE smoke in the cold, standing next to the
hood of her car.
JACKIE
The Jacket. That's what they call it,
right?
STARKS
Yeah.
JACKIE
It was banned, you know... and it led
to an investigation of Dr. Becker's
mistreatment of some of his patients.
That's when they found out how badly
he was drugging his patients...
STARKS [Starting to make sense]
So he was giving me all kinds of
drugs...
JACKIE [Nodding]
Apparently. He was taking a lot of
them, too. It said he was trying out
behavior modification treatments that
were banned back in the 70s -- "womb
treatment" is the name he gave to
what he did to you...
STARKS [Cutting in]
Womb? A fuckin' womb? What kind of
animal did he come out of?
JACKIE
But no one knew until after...
STARKS
After I...
70.
JACKIE nods.
JACKIE
[Beat] You bled to death.
STARKS
What?
JACKIE
I don't know how you got the cut to
your head, but you died bleeding from
it.
STARKS [Digesting]
And you're sure my body was found on
January 1st?
JACKIE nods.
STARKS
Do you really believe me?
JACKIE
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was
crazy after you left that day. I died.
I still think I could be crazy. But
then I replayed that night in my head --
the parts of it I could remember --
and it was like...I don't care if I
was, or am. I haven't felt that way
in a room with someone my whole life.
[Beat] And when you left, all I
wanted was...
JACKIE looks around her; coupled with the cold, her sobriety
is obvious. STARKS takes hold of her and holds her face close
to his so that their foreheads touch.
JACKIE
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should
I trust you?
STARKS
Yes.
JACKIE
Then we need to figure out what
happened to you. It's the only thing
we can do.
STARKS
I know.
71.
JACKIE
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked
it up on the net. We should go there
and see if there's still anyone
around who might have known what
happened to you.
STARKS
If they don't take me out before
then. [As an afterthought] What's the
net?
JACKIE looks at him and laughs.
STARKS is standing above his own headstone: WILLIAM STARKS,
December 25, 1967 - January 1, 1993. Next to his grave is that
of RUDY MACKENZIE. STARKS looks down sadly at both. JACKIE
comes up behind him.
JACKIE
How long do we have?
STARKS
I don't know.
JACKIE
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne
now. I looked him up and he was
listed.
STARKS looks scared and lost -- like it's all catching up to
him. And like he might be being taken out of the Jacket.
STARKS
How far away is that?
82.
PAGE MISSING
83.
JACKIE kisses his SCARS -- from the war and the Jacket -- and
STARKS lifts her higher so he can look at her as they make
love for the first time.
STARKS sits by a window -- I.V.'s in his arm -- smoking feebly,
still severely weak from the Jacket, while DR. LORENSON
observes him for a bit from the hall before she goes inside.
LORENSON
You'll die if you keep smoking those
in your condition.
STARKS
I'll die either way.
LORENSON pulls up a chair and sits opposite him.
LORENSON
I can't try to help you unless you
let me. [Beat] I know about the
Jacket.
STARKS waits to see what this means.
LORENSON
I'm sorry for what you were put
through, and I'm sorry I couldn't
stop it earlier. But I promise you
that I will from now on...
STARKS [Cutting him off]
I don't want you to.
LORENSON doesn't understand.
85.
LORENSON
What do you mean?
STARKS
You have no idea what's going on.
LORENSON
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to
you.
STARKS
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket
is my only chance in this place.
LORENSON just thinks it's another delusion.
LORENSON
How can you say that in your physical
condition? Do you realize that it's
because you were put in it that
you're as...weak as you are now?
Becker's a man who's not well
himself.
STARKS searches for words that won't sound as crazy as he
knows he appears. They don't exist.
STARKS
You don't understand.
LORENSON
Then help me understand. You know,
you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets
have begun to experience curious
symptoms. What you have might well be
a syndrome and, if so, it's not one
we know enough about to be treating
it this vigorously.
STARKS
This has nothing to do with that.
LORENSON [Exasperated]
Then what? What? [Beat] I can't guess
it. You have to help me.
STARKS fixes his eyes on Lorenson. He has nothing to lose but
still he treads carefully. The words that follow come almost
unwittingly.
STARKS
...What you do not know is the only
thing you know.
(MORE)
86.
STARKS (cont'd)
[Beat] And what you own is what you
do not own...
And where you are is where you are
not.
LORENSON
[Beat] Where is that from?
It's as though STARKS hears his words for the first time.
STARKS
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
LORENSON
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
STARKS
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not
this time. And I'm only able to see
it when I'm in the Jacket.
LORENSON
Well, what time is it?
STARKS
2004.
LORENSON nods, trying to mask his dismay but failing.
STARKS
You don't believe me.
LORENSON [Testing him]
Well, what year do you think it is
now?
STARKS [Exasperated]
I'm not delusional. I know it's 1992.
Same as every sane person.
LORENSON
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me
about the future. 2004. What does it
look like?
STARKS
It doesn't look all that different.
LORENSON
The future doesn't look different?
STARKS
No. Not for people like me. [Beat]
Not in the places I come from.
87.
LORENSON
What about the world?
STARKS
I didn't see that much of it -- same
as now. I only saw it as part of my
own life.
LORENSON looks at STARKS, unintentionally patronizing.
LORENSON
Do you think you're traveling in
time? Is that it?
STARKS shakes his head and momentarily challenges Lorenson
simply with his air of calm resolve.
STARKS
Not everyone in here is crazy, Doc.
LORENSON searches for another approach.
LORENSON
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie
maybe?
STARKS
Maybe.
LORENSON [Matter-of-factly]
Did he tell you he tried to kill his
wife?
STARKS nods.
LORENSON
MacKenzie locked himself up in his
house for two months and nearly
starved himself to death before he
was brought here. All because his
wife left him for another man.
STARKS moves to put his cigarette out and his I.V. almost
falls out of his arm. LORENSON makes a move to adjust it and
STARKS flinches perceptibly, startling LORENSON.
STARKS [Adjusting it himself]
Maybe that just makes him weak, not
crazy. Or maybe he is crazy. [Beat]
Still doesn't make me think I am.
(MORE)
88.
STARKS [Adjusting it himself]
And, judging by the fact that you
just told me about another patient,
it doesn't even make you think I am,
so what don't you work on persuading
yourself first.
LORENSON
Why don't you help me?
STARKS
Because I don't have time.
LORENSON
Why not?
STARKS
I'm about to die unless I do
something to stop it.
LORENSON
And how do you know that?
STARKS
Because of the future. I know what's
going to happen.
LORENSON
William, that is just another facet
of my delusions.
Then, STARKS remembers the only thing that might help him. He
pauses, trying to recall as much of it as he can.
STARKS
And what about your work with Eugene --
the kid? Is that another facet of my
delusions?
LORENSON -- having prepared to continue -- is bowled over at
the mention of her patient. She loses all color and calm in
her features.
LORENSON
How do you know about Eugene?
STARKS
You told me about him. I saw you and
I think you thought I knew something
about him. So you told me.
LORENSON doesn't know what to say.
LORENSON [Somewhat angrily]
How do you know about Eugene!?
89.
STARKS [Shaking his head in disbelief]
You told me. It's like two parts of
you talking through me. Look, judging
from your reaction, there's no other
way I could know about him.
LORENSON
There obviously is, so what don't you
just tell me how you found out about
him.
STARKS looks at her convincingly.
STARKS
Some part of you suspects -- even if
you don't know for sure -- that what
I'm saying is true.
LORENSON
I don't know how you know about
Eugene, but these ideas are part of
your delusions.
STARKS
NO! They're not my delusions! Look,
just leave my business with Becker to
me!
LORENSON
One thing's got nothing to do with
the other.
STARKS
One's got everything to do with the
other. So unless you want my blood on
your hands...leave what's between me
and Becker between me and Becker.
LORENSON backs off, jarred by Starks' assertions and fearful
of his debilitating vehemence.
JACKIE speeds through the streets of Shelbourne, presumably
on their way to Becker's house.
They've slowed down a little.
JACKIE [O.S.]
I think this is his house.
STARKS knocks on the door. No answer.
JACKIE tries to look through the windows to see if anyone's
there. No one is. It looks small and dark inside.
STARKS knocks again, looking down anxiously at his feet.
JACKIE walks up to him from around the side of the house.
They don't have the time to wait.
JACKIE
They're not here.
STARKS
They're not.
JACKIE
[Beat, lost] No.
JACKIE notices how COLD Starks looks.
JACKIE
Maybe they're out.
STARKS nods.
99.
JACKIE and STARKS head back to the only MAIN STREET in the
town. As they approach the town church, they start to see a
ROW of cars parallel-parked on the street.
JACKIE pulls up to the entrance of the CHURCH.
JACKIE boldly opens the CHURCH door.
101.
JACKIE and STARKS watch as the people file out of Church.
They are leaning against her car when STARKS spots him.
DR. BECKER walks beside a SMALL CHILD -- presumably his
GRANDSON. JACKIE registers his formidableness with some
surprise; Becker's maintained a strong physique and is hardly
a shade less intimidating than he was before. Only his hand
has a permanent shake now.
STARKS doesn't waste any time. He heads straight for him.
Almost sensing him, BECKER looks in his direction. The casual
look on his face is instantly supplanted by one of DISBELIEF.
STARKS
You still go to Church. How's that
work? Your God just doesn't notice?
That it? [Beat, serious] How you
doin', Dr. Becker?
BECKER stops walking and looks at Starks. His GRANDSON looks
at him.
BECKER'S GRANDSON
Grandpa?
BECKER [Still looking at Starks]
Sean, why don't you wait for me by
the car? I'll be there in a minute.
[Turning to the kid] Ok?
His grandson, momentarily appeased, heads for the car.
BECKER [To Starks]
Can I help you?
STARKS
I don't know, Dr. Becker. Can you?
102.
That's enough to confirm for BECKER who STARKS is.
All around them, people leaving Church socialize routinely --
unaware of the haunted history being made between them.
BECKER
Who are you?
STARKS
I think you know. Your eyes say you
do.
BECKER
[Beat] You're his son?
STARKS
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat]
What? You look like you've seen a
ghost. You can come here and touch
me, old man. I'm the real thing.
BECKER
How...how are you here?
STARKS looks at Becker -- each a terrifying reminder of the
other's past.
BECKER
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the
hospital.
STARKS
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't
you?
BECKER
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I
probably helped push you to kill
yourself, but I didn't do it.
STARKS
I didn't kill myself. I died from a
blow to the head. How'd it happen? I
have to know.
BECKER looks at him, nearly too stunned to speak.
BECKER
I don't know how you died. The last
time I put you in the Jacket was just
after you told me you remembered
killing that police officer...
103.
STARKS
I didn't say I remembered killing
him. I just repeated some words to
get myself back in there.
BECKER
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you
came out.
STARKS
How?
BECKER
Because...because you came out and
said something you couldn't have
possibly have known. You came back
and repeated three names...
BECKER falters as he recalls his offenses.
BECKER
Of people like you. People I was just
trying to help. They couldn't get
worse so I thought, with medication,
they might get...
STARKS
Medication? What kind of meds do you
chase with nights in a cadaver
drawer?
BECKER
It was part of the treatment I
intended...I didn't know what the
effects would be...
STARKS
So, what, you guinea pig sick people
to find out?
BECKER
The three of you weren't regular
patients. You were criminals that
ended up at Alpine Grove.
STARKS
No, we were patients.
BECKER concedes after all this time.
BECKER
You and the others didn't seem that
way then.
104.
STARKS is quiet as he comes to understand how it's about to
work out: if Becker tells him those names now, he essentially
indicts himself.
STARKS
Who were the others?
BECKER remembers with a hint of remorse.
BECKER [Racked with remorse]
Nathan Piechowski, Jackson
MacGregor, and Ted Casey. [Beat] I
didn't ask for you -- for any of
you. You were all sent to me.
STARKS looks at Becker, in astonishment.
BECKER
What is it?
STARKS just stares at Becker, waiting for the realization to
hit him, too.
BECKER
How did you come to know their
names?
STARKS
You just told me. The last time I
was with you was when I was in the
Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr.
Becker.
BECKER
I don't understand...
STARKS
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're
haunting yourself right now. [Beat]
I guess sometimes we indict
ourselves if no one else does. You
didn't make history like you wanted
to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out
different, didn't it?
BECKER
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
STARKS
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and
then you put me in the Jacket.
105.
BECKER [Stoically]
I was sorry when I heard you died.
I was, but...how was I to know you
didn't shoot that police officer?
STARKS
The same way you just said I didn't
without my ever telling you. [Beat]
And that still doesn't excuse what
you did. Just because you had keys
to a cage didn't mean you had
animals inside. [Beat] You've
earned your guilt, Becker.
STARKS shares a last look with Becker before he walks away
towards the car.
JACKIE and STARKS speed on the highway. As STARKS sleeps,
JACKIE keeps looking over at him like it's a way to make sure
he stays with her.
(Cont'd from the scene after STARKS left Jean and Jackie's
place):
108.
STARKS is walking back on the same highway just after the sun
has set, and just after he helped JEAN and JACKIE, on that
fateful day...
This time we see a CAR stop for him from a much closer
distance. TENNY pulls up towards STARKS and rolls down the
window on the passenger side. STARKS bends down to be able to
see the driver.
TENNY
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
STARKS
Where are you going?
TENNY
I'm going to Canada but I can let
you ride with me up to the border.
STARKS considers this.
TENNY
Can you drive?
STARKS
Sure.
TENNY
Great, get in. We'll switch off in
a bit.
We pull back and see the same SHOT, from a distance, of
STARKS putting his BAG in the back and getting in. As he
opens the CAR DOOR, we hear the MUSIC playing inside. As they
drive off, the MUSIC fades further and further in the
distance as we...
CUT TO:
LORENSON helps STARKS into the parking lot as it snows.
DR. LORENSON and STARKS drive up to Jean and Jackie's house.
LORENSON
You want me to come with you?
STARKS
No, I'll be ok.
STARKS slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on
it as best as he can. The sound, however, is still
understandably soft.
STARKS waits and then reaches for the knob on the door. He
opens it and looks inside. We first see his face, and the
devastation on it, as we guess the sight he's laid eyes on.
JACKIE is sitting at the kitchen table, still only 7 years
old. Though STARKS expected it, he falters under the
disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman
he loved. As she looks up at him, it's all he can do not to
break down.
STARKS
Hi.
JACKIE [Surprised]
Hey. [Beat] I remember you.
STARKS
I remember you, too.
STARKS shakes his head, looking at her. She looks beautiful,
and still hopeful. Her life lays ahead of her and her fate --
when he found her in 2004 -- remains as distant as possible
from this innocent, still promising image.
STARKS
Jackie, how have you been?
119.
JACKIE smiles; she doesn't get asked that often.
JACKIE
I've been ok.
STARKS
Good. How's your mom?
JACKIE
Ok, I guess.
STARKS nods. JACKIE smiles. It's all he can do not to
crumble.
STARKS
Do you think I could see her?
She looks at him and senses, like kids do, the desperation in
his eyes.
JACKIE
Sure.
JACKIE calls out for Jean, then runs up the stairs to get
her. LORENSON has gotten out of the car and is waiting
outside on the porch. STARKS remains in the doorway.
Some seconds later, JEAN appears -- gaunt but in a slightly
better state than we saw her before.
JEAN
Can I help you?
STARKS
Hey, Jean. Nice to see you.
JEAN looks a little confused.
JEAN
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully
familiar, I just can't quite place
it...
JACKIE
Mom, this is the guy that drove us
home that afternoon we were stuck
on the highway. The guy you yelled
at for no good reason...
JEAN
Oh, yeah.
120.
She gives him a once over, and, seeing how weakened he looks,
decides intuitively he can't be much harm. She also notices
LORENSON waiting by the car.
JEAN
There something you need?
STARKS
You could say that.
STARKS looks at JACKIE, hesitating because of her. Sensing
this, JEAN asks Jackie to leave.
JEAN
Jackie, go play in the snow.
JACKIE
Why?
JEAN
Just do it.
JACKIE leaves and walks to the yard. STARKS watches.
STARKS
I can't stay long. [Motioning to
Lorenson] That's my doctor and I
gotta get back to the hospital.
Everything I want to say is in this
letter. [Beat] You can check as
much of it as you can.
STARKS hands her the LETTER.
STARKS
I won't be around when you read
it...but I hope you believe it.
It'd be a real shame if you didn't.
JEAN looks baffled but, seeming to grasp his urgency, nods.
STARKS
[Beat] I should be on my way.
JACKIE has been watching this exchange from the shed. When he
looks over there, he catches her eye and CALLS OUT, with what
strength he has left...
STARKS
Bye, Jackie.
121.
These are the hardest words STARKS has probably ever had to
say. JACKIE just stares after him, as does JEAN, as he shows
himself out.
STARKS
Happy New Year to both of you.
JEAN
Thanks. You, too.
As STARKS is walking away, we see his eyes begin to tear in
the cold -- but not from it.
on its surface, the reflection of a TEENAGE BOY'S FACE before
he touches it and sends it rippling...
suit, holding an URN, letting the ASHES fly into the water...
We see now that it was DR. LORENSON who put Starks in.
Exhausted from the physical strain of getting him in there,
she stares at the closed drawer, like looking at it is one
way to look after Starks.
Over the sounds of CARS slushing in the snow, an IMAGE fades
up slowly on the screen, until we see it's STARKS, standing
in the parking lot outside the diner once more.
This time he seems situated, and hopeful. After a slightly
longer wait than the first time, JACKIE walks out -- in the
same way as before except that she wears a NURSE'S UNIFORM
and an unmistakable air of vitality.
Jackie looks directly at Starks and we see the same
attraction between them teeming even more than before. Even
as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel, with a
BLEEDING CUT on his head and no coat in the cold, STARKS is
someone we see she wants to be near.
Then we see JACKIE as STARKS does: she looks beautiful,
alive, happy and just like the woman he never wanted to
leave. She approaches Starks warmly, less suspicious of the
world -- and less devastated by it -- than we remember her
being.
JACKIE
Hey there. [Beat] You ok?
STARKS revels in the moment. In their reunion.
STARKS
I think so.
JACKIE
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
STARKS touches his FOREHEAD in a panic and, seeing the BLOOD
on his hands, looks up at her, terrified. Sensing this, she
moves closer to calm him.
JACKIE
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just
a cut. We can get it fixed.
(MORE)
127.
JACKIE (cont'd)
But we need to get you to the
hospital now. How'd you get that?
STARKS
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
STARKS looks at her -- immensely relieved and grateful.
JACKIE [Laughing a little]
Yes, you are alive. But, listen, it's
New Year's Day. You're not going to
get a cab. Especially not here. And
you're gonna freeze if you stand out
here in the snow much longer. I'm on
my way back to my shift at the
hospital...
STARKS
You work there?
JACKIE [Gesturing to her uniform]
Yeah, I'm a nurse. Why don't you let
me give you a ride...
STARKS falters slightly as he walks. JACKIE helps him make it
to the car, much like before...
STARKS
Thanks.
Jackie's car pulls onto the highway, alongside the other,
more modern cars on the highway.
JACKIE (O.S.)
How you doin'?
STARKS
I'm doing fine.
The happy sound of their engine on the highway continues,
uninterrupted, for some seconds, before, first faintly then
louder, we hear a racking, all too familiar sound: the DRAWER
creaking as it's opened once more...
