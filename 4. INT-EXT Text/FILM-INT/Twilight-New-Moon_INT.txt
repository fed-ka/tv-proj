ON BELLA - her eyes snap open. She lies atop her bed. A
book, "ROMEO AND JULIET," lays open on her chest. Bella
sits up, the dream still weighing on her...
INCLUDE HER ROOM, cluttered with pictures of Edward, of the
Cullens; memorabilia of all things Edward. A KNOCK on the
door. CHIEF CHARLIE SWAN enters carrying two gifts, one
wrapped, one not.
CHARLIE
Happy birthday, Bells.
BELLA
Dad, we agreed, no gifts.
CHARLIE
At least mine's not wrapped.
He hands it to her. It's a digital camera.
Bella's
pleased, despite herself.
BELLA
Okay, this is actually kind of great.
Thanks, Dad.
CHARLIE
(re: wrapped gift)
Goes with this one from your mom. We
coordinated - well, she coordinated
me.
Bella opens the wrapped gift to reveal a SCRAPBOOK.
CHARLIE
To put your pictures in, record your
senior year -- man, senior year.
How'd you get so old so fast?
BELLA
Not that old.
4.
CHARLIE
I don't know. Is that a wrinkle?
Bella races to the mirror, searches her face.
CHARLIE
I was kidding.
BELLA
So not funny, Dad.
Edward and Bella enter the double doors -- suddenly a small,
wrapped gift appears in Bella's face. ALICE presents it.
ALICE
Happy --
BELLA
Shh!
-- Alice whispers in her ear as she hugs Bella --
ALICE
-- birthday.
Over Alice's shoulder, Bella sees JASPER, keeping his
distance. He offers her a pleasant nod. She tries to hide
Alice's present, hoping no one noticed --
BELLA
Alice, didn't I say no gifts?
ALICE
You did. I didn't. I've already seen
you open it and guess what? You love
it.
BELLA
You had a vision about my birthday.
ALICE
And about the green dress you'll be
wearing to your party tonight. Great
color on you.
BELLA
... My party?
9.
ALICE
Please?
It'll be fun.
BELLA
(beat, confused)
I... guess I can deal --
ALICE
(hurriedly)
-- Great! See ya at seven!
Alice hugs her again and races off before she can change her
mind. Which is when Bella realizes --
BELLA
Wait, Jasper, no fair with the mood
control.
He offers an apologetic bow before Alice drags him away.
EDWARD
Vampires.
You can't trust them.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON A T.V. MONITOR - Zeffirelli's `68 "Romeo and
Juliet" plays. The suicide scene.
ROMEO
Arms, take your last embrace, and
lips, O you, the doors of breath, seal
with a righteous kiss...
PULL BACK TO INCLUDE --
The room is dark as we PAN OVER the class, some students
entertained, some moved, Mike trying not to fall asleep.
The teacher, MR. BERTY, mouths every word --
ROMEO
Here's to my love!
(drinks)
O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick.
FIND Edward and Bella in the back of the room, desks pushed
together, whisper-talking.
BELLA
I hate being... celebrated.
10.
EDWARD
Come on, the last real birthday any of
us had was Emmett's - I think Bing
Crosby was on top of the charts.
(then)
You'll be helping us feel normal for a
night.
Bella sits back, knowing she's trapped.
He kisses her hand.
EDWARD
There are worse tragedies than a
birthday. Look at Romeo. He's
responsible for his wife's death. Who
could live with that?
(looks at the screen)
... Though I do envy him one thing.
BELLA
(blanches slightly)
Juliet's alright... if you like that
obviously beautiful sort of thing.
EDWARD
Not the girl - the suicide.
(off her look)
Nearly impossible for my kind. But
humans, a little poison, dagger to the
heart. There are so many options.
BELLA
(appalled)
Why would you even think about that?
He turns her wrist over, runs his hand over the horseshoe
shaped SCAR on her forearm.
EDWARD
(shrugs)
I considered it. Once.
When James
had you trapped.
FLASHPOP TO "Twilight" - In the ballet studio, JAMES grabs
Bella's arm and BITES --
BACK ON EDWARD - pained.
EDWARD
I didn't know if I'd find you in time.
If I'd gotten you killed --
BELLA
It wouldn't have been your fault --
11.
EDWARD
Either way, I had a plan.
BELLA
What plan?
EDWARD
There are... ways for us. At least
one way. I would have gone to Italy,
provoked the Volturi...
BELLA
The who?
MR. BERTY
Is there something you'd like to share
with the class, Edward?
EDWARD
(politely)
Certainly not. But I apologize for
being a distraction. Perhaps you
should rewind to act five, scene one,
line twenty-eight eighty-nine --
(reciting)
"If you had the strength of twenty men
it would dispatch you straight."
Mr. Berty just looks at him, then moves off, intimidated --
MR. BERTY
Eyes on the screen, people.
Bella is too concerned to be amused.
ON AN 18TH CENTURY OIL PAINTING, depicting Grecian figures in
swirling robes writhing among pillars and balconies. In a
high balcony, FOUR CALM FIGURES look down upon the bacchanal;
two black haired, one snowy white, one golden haired...
EDWARD (O.S.)
The closest thing my world has to
royalty...
12.
INCLUDE -- Edward and Bella (now wearing a green dress).
She studies the painting - the largest on a wall crowded
with pictures. The other walls are towering bookshelves.
EDWARD
Francesco Solimena painted this; he
often depicted the Volturi as Gods.
Bella examines the golden haired "God."
BELLA
Is that... Carlisle?
EDWARD
Yes. He lived with them for a few
decades. He describes them as very
refined - for killers.
PUSH IN ON THE PAINTING, THE FOURSOME
Their features begin to fill in, become real - THEY COME TO
LIFE in the painting, turning to leave the balcony through
an archway. We FOLLOW THEM into --
It's centuries old, its marble cracked and weathered. The
open oculus in the domed ceiling is the only source of
light. The room is empty but for three large wooden chairs
and half a dozen VAMPIRES in elegant 18th century attire.
EDWARD (V.O.)
The Volturi are also what you might
call enforcers.
BELLA (V.O.)
Of what?
EDWARD (V.O.)
The only rule they have: to keep
secret the existence of our kind.
Two of the Volturi, MARCUS and CAIUS, take their seats,
Carlisle stands beside them. ARO moves to the center of the
room where we REVEAL --
A ROGUE VAMPIRE is on his knees. He looks feral compared to
the others, and terrified. Aro puts his hands on either
side of the Rogue's face. Compassion?
13.
EDWARD (V.O.)
We don't make spectacles of ourselves,
or kill conspicuously, unless we want
to die.
Aro then slowly, dispassionately, RIPS THE ROGUE'S HEAD OFF.
Two Volturi Guards (FELIX and DEMETRI) appear on either
side, holding him down as Aro easily detaches the head and
tosses it aside. Aro calmly sits as the others tear the
Rogue limb from limb. Carlisle has to look away...
-- as Bella spins on Edward --
BELLA
Don't even -- talk about that. You
can't let anyone hurt you. The
Volturi or anyone else.
EDWARD
(sees she's worried)
Who else would hurt me?
BELLA
You said there were more dangerous
things out there than you. And I know
you have at least one enemy --
OFF BELLA'S FACE - FLASHPOPS:
-- ON ALL THREE EVIL VAMPIRES, James, VICTORIA, the dread-
locked LAURENT (from "Twilight")
-- CLOSE ON VICTORIA - fire-red hair, burgundy red eyes,
feral, vicious grin (from "Twilight")
BELLA (O.S.)
You said she'd come after you for
killing her mate.
BACK ON BELLA AND EDWARD
EDWARD
Victoria? Yes, some day. But Alice
will see her coming. And she won't win.
Bella looks up at him, pained.
BELLA
I hate that I can't protect you.
He laughs, amused.
She's decidedly not.
14.
BELLA
That was me being serious.
EDWARD
(kissing her face)
I know. But you do protect me...
(kisses her nose)
From boredom...
(kisses her lips)
And loneliness...
(in between kisses)
You give me a reason to stay... un-
dead. But it's... my job; to protect
you...
-- but he stops, smiles, hearing something in his mind --
EDWARD
... from everyone but my sister.
-- as the door bursts open and Alice dances in.
ALICE
It's time it's time it's time!
Alice tugs Bella and Edward to the top of the landing, then
skips down the stairs. They look down into --
THE LIVING ROOM - Hundreds of pink candles and rose-filled
crystal bowls. ROSALIE, ESME, EMMETT, Carlisle, Jasper and
Alice look up at her, all of them stunningly beautiful.
Bella would love to disappear, but Edward leads her down to --
THE LIVING ROOM -- where Esme and Carlisle hug Bella warmly.
CARLISLE
Sorry about all this.
We tried to
rein Alice in.
ESME
Like that's even possible.
Happy
birthday, Bella.
FLASH!
Alice has snapped a picture of Bella with them.
ALICE
(re: camera)
Found it in your bag.
Mind?
Emmett moves to Edward's side.
Nudges him.
15.
EMMETT
Dating an older woman.
Hot.
Bella caught that.
Edward elbows him sharply to shut up.
EMMETT
What?
Rosalie steps up.
Shoves a silver package at Bella.
ROSALIE
It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.
She walks away, bored. Bella has to smile.
She sees Jasper
across the room. They wave to each other.
ALICE
(aims the camera)
Show me the love!
Edward pulls Bella into an embrace, they look deeply into
one another's eyes. FLASH!
ALICE
For your scrapbook.
Now open your
presents!
Alice drags Bella over to a table piled with elaborately
wrapped gifts, a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates.
BELLA
Alice, I'm the only one who even eats
cake. That thing could feed fifty.
ALICE
Hope you're hungry.
Here, this one's
from Emmett.
The others crowd around... Jasper somewhat away. Bella, no
fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find
an empty car-radio box.
BELLA
Um... thanks?
EMMETT
Already installed it in your truck.
EDWARD
Finally, a decent sound system in that
piece of --
16.
BELLA
No hating on the truck.
Thank you,
Emmett.
ALICE
Open mine.
Alice hands her a box.
Bella starts to open it, but --
BELLA
Ouch - paper cut.
CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGER - A single drop of deep red blood
appears.
Bella thinks little of it, but then HEARS a disturbing,
grisly SNARL -- she looks up just as --
BELLA'S POV - JASPER lunges toward her!
Teeth bared, eyes
beyond reason --
-- Edward FLINGS Bella behind his own body, causing her to
CRASH into the table, plates shattering as --
-- Jasper SLAMS into Edward; sounds like boulders colliding.
-- Edward pushes him, hard; Jasper SAILS backward, hitting
the wall. But he RICOCHETS off it and comes back at Bella.
-- Emmett and Carlisle TACKLE Jasper from the side, dragging
him to the ground -- Alice helps hold him down --
ALICE
(soothingly)
Jaz... shhh --
... But she stops, her head suddenly jerking toward Bella.
Then everybody's eyes snap toward Bella as they catch the
overwhelming scent --
ON BELLA - lying amid the shards of broken china. She looks
at her arm, seeing now - it's been slashed by plate shards;
bright red blood pulses out of her, pooling. She looks up --
BELLA'S POV - THE CULLENS (SLOW MOTION)
All of them now, including Edward (but not Carlisle) stare
down at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes. Six suddenly
ravenous vampires...
SLOW MOTION ABRUPTLY ENDS as -- Carlisle jumps to Bella's
side. Edward, though white as a bone, snaps out of it and
stands between her and the others.
17.
CARLISLE
Emmett, get Jasper out of here.
(no response)
Emmett.
Emmett reins himself in, elbows Rosalie. They drag the
snarling Jasper out. Esme holds her nose, politely exits
with the others. Alice looks at Bella, apologetic --
ALICE
I'm sorry, I... can't...
She slips out the door.
Edward's still on guard as Carlisle
examines Bella's arm.
CARLISLE
I'll have to stitch this up.
EDWARD
I'll carry her to the kitchen.
He moves to pick her up, but his eyes dart to the blood.
CARLISLE
I'll take care of her, Edward.
(Edward doesn't move)
Check on Jasper. Go.
Edward looks from him to Bella. Then steps back, allowing
Carlisle to lift Bella and carry her to the kitchen. But
just before the kitchen door closes, Bella sees Edward's
agonized face. He turns away, unable to meet her eyes...
Bella sits in a chair opposite Carlisle who mops up her
blood as he removes glass shards from her arm. He drops one
into a bowl; PLINK. She tries not to look at the blood.
BELLA
I sure can kill a party.
CARLISLE
It's not your fault. Jasper hasn't
been away from human blood as long as
the rest of us.
BELLA
Seems like you're the only one it
doesn't effect.
CARLISLE
Centuries of practice.
18.
BELLA
Did you ever think of... living
differently?
CARLISLE
I enjoy
my work too much. Helping
people,
saving lives. I'm hoping
there's
a point to my existence, even
if I am
damned.
BELLA
Damned?
You're not damned.
CARLISLE
Then you and I agree. But Edward
doesn't believe there's an afterlife
for our kind.
(looking at her)
He thinks we've lost our souls.
BELLA
(realizing)
That's why he won't... He thinks he'd
be damning me.
CARLISLE (CONT'D)
If you believed as he did, would you
risk it?
Off Bella, no, not ever...
A large red bow hangs from the new stereo in the dashboard.
Edward drives in silence. Bella studies him. Finally --
BELLA
Say something.
EDWARD
What do you want me to say?
BELLA
That I'm a klutz. That I should have
been more careful --
EDWARD
You got a paper cut. Normal people
get paper cuts. And a normal
boyfriend wouldn't have flung you into
a stack of plates. A normal boyfriend
wouldn't have had to fight the urge to
kill you --
19.
BELLA
Stop.
I don't want normal, I want
you.
Edward doesn't respond, just pulls the truck into --
The truck stops.
Beat.
BELLA
You can't protect me from everything -
something's going to separate us --
accident, illness, old age... as long
as I'm human...
EDWARD
(appalled)
That's your solution?
My ending your
life?
BELLA
Your giving me forever.
He faces forward again, jaw tight, mind working, tormented.
She reaches for his hand --
BELLA
Carlisle told me how you feel, about
my soul, but I don't believe that --
-- he subtly moves his hand away from hers.
EDWARD
You should go in. It's late.
He climbs out - instantly he's opening the passenger side
door for her. She climbs out. He looks down at her face -
he softens as he takes it in. Puts a hand on her cheek.
BELLA
I'll leave my window open for you.
EDWARD
(quietly)
I won't be coming back.
Not tonight.
BELLA
Then... can I ask for one thing?
It's
still my birthday.
(off his nod)
Kiss me?
20.
He lifts her face to his, and kisses her. He begins
carefully, gently... but it changes, he becomes urgent, with
an almost painful edge, as if it were goodbye.
Abruptly, he pulls away. With a last look, he turns walks
off into the night. Off Bella...
ON A PHOTO - as a printer spits it out. It's the pic Alice
took of Bella and Edward's embrace. Bella, troubled, puts
it in her scrapbook, her bandaged finger running over it.
"Romeo and Juliet" lessons are on the board. Everyone's
scribbling essays. Bella glances at Edward's desk; empty --
FLASHPOP TO -- (previous scene in truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S
EYES, hard, turning away from her...
Bella sits with Jessica, Angela, Eric and Mike. They joke,
throw things. Bella's distracted, looking-out for Edward.
FLASHPOP TO -- (scene in the truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S HAND
moving away from hers...
BACK ON BELLA'S WORRIED FACE, off which we go to --
PAN the photos on the wall. INCLUDE EDWARD who studies
them, his expression grim. He looks down at Bella's
SCRAPBOOK to SEE the photo of him and Bella. He pulls it
out, takes a closer look...
Bella's eyes open to find herself FLOATING several feet
above the ground. Trees pass by. She's being carried...
OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE BED - Charlie lays Bella down and wraps
her in blankets...
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES ON BELLA
She's curled in a fetal position in the middle of the bed.
Then at its foot. Under the blankets. On top of them. In
various different arrangements. Meanwhile...
A BLACK LIQUID begins to flood the floor, slowly swallowing
everything in the room. It rises up the sides of the bed,
higher and higher until it breaches the top of the bed and
begins to engulf Bella. Off her, submerged in blackness...
26.
Bella sits in a rocking chair by the window. Her face
blank. Empty. STAY ON BELLA, unchanging - but THROUGH THE
WINDOW OUTSIDE, we SEE TIME LAPSING behind her --
OCTOBER -- Costumed kids appear in the yard, trick-or-
treating. DISSOLVE INTO...
NOVEMBER -- NEIGHBORS (BOB MARKS and his WIFE) bring Charlie
a turkey... they glance up at Bella's window with concern...
WINTER BEGINS -- the trees' branches are now bare...
DECEMBER -- Charlie drags a Christmas tree toward the house...
worry has taken its toll on him. But Bella remains
unchanged...
BELLA (V.O.)
Dear Mom... I'm...
(beat)
... lost...
PAN the now blank walls of the exceedingly neat room; gone
are all traces of Edward...
BELLA (V.O.)
Edward took everything with him.
Including my life. He promised it
would be like he never existed...
... LAND ON the scrapbook which lies open; the photo of
Bella and Edward's embrace at the birthday party - gone.
BELLA AT HER COMPUTER, typing an e-mail to Renee.
BELLA (V.O.)
... But I need to know he did.
A SERIES OF TABLEAUS, DISSOLVING INTO ONE ANOTHER:
Bella sits on the couch, blank, as the rain pounds.
Charlie
watches her, concerned.
27.
BELLA (V.O.)
It's like a huge hole has been punched
through my chest...
In the darkness, Bella is curled up in a ball on her floor.
BELLA (V.O.)
But the pain is my only reminder that
he was real... that they all were...
Lunch. Bella sits alone, staring straight ahead. SEE
Jessica, Eric, Angela and Mike, watching her with concern.
Talking about her. She doesn't notice.
BELLA (V.O.)
I miss them. Especially Alice...
Alice faces off with Carlisle as the others watch on. Esme
desolate; Emmett blank. He sits next to Rosalie who seems
almost irritated. Jasper isolates himself in a corner.
CARLISLE
No.
We promised Edward.
ALICE
But she won't do well without us. I get
flashes of her, but they're unclear --
ROSALIE
Forget her, let's drag Edward home.
ESME
He'll come back when he's ready.
After Bella moves on.
28.
CARLISLE
Yes. When she's living her life, safe
from danger --
JASPER
(with self-contempt)
You mean safe from us.
Alice wraps an arm around Jasper, soothingly.
ROSALIE
(pointedly to Alice)
And when will that be?
EMMETT
Can you see him, Alice?
They all turn to Alice... a beat. She closes her eyes,
trying to get a lock on Edward -- PUSH IN ON ALICE as --
ALICE
The only decision he's made...
SMASH TO:
INCLUDE BELLA'S COMPUTER SCREEN, as she types...
BELLA (V.O.)
Like the pulse of blood behind a bruise...
Bella stops. A beat as she stares at her own words.
Then
she hits "select all" and "delete" --
ON THE COMPUTER - A BLANK DOCUMENT. She types: "Hi Mom,
things are great, grades are up. Hanging with friends.
Stop worrying. I'm fine."
Bella presses "send", and the cheery e-mail disappears.
Bella rises, returns to her rocking chair, staring out
desolately. PUSH PAST HER OUTSIDE...
AN UNKNOWN POV FROM THE WOODS - ON BELLA IN THE WINDOW
-- Someone's watching her, pacing menacingly, hungrily...
DISSOLVE TO:
Bella drives, talking on her cell (hands-free, of course).
BELLA
... Yes, Bella Swan. Hey, any chance
you feel like shopping tomorrow?
Motorcycle parts are spread out on blankets.
Jacob moves
among them excitedly, piecing them together.
Bella watches.
BELLA
If we're going to be working on this
every day, we should probably include
some homework. Don't want the Dads to
think I'm a bad influence on you.
JACOB
You influence me?
Please.
BELLA
I am older than you.
JACOB
Age ain't nothin' but a number.
BELLA
And I convinced you to secretly build
us two-wheeled death machines.
JACOB
(sudden mock-horror)
God, you're right, you're like Satan --
QUIL (O.S.)
Yo, Jake, you in there?
Bella abruptly sits up, starts to pull a tarp over the bikes.
JACOB
It's cool, it's just my boys.
QUIL ATEARA and EMBRY CALL enter, both 16. Quil is short,
stocky and feisty, with short hair. Embry is tall, thin and
laid back, with chin-length black hair.
EMBRY
Hey, Jake --
39.
They stop when they see Bella.
The two guys share a smile.
JACOB
Hey. This is Bella.
Bella, that's
Quil and Embry.
QUIL
So the bike building story is true.
BELLA
Taught him everything he knows.
QUIL
What about the part where you're his
girlfriend?
BELLA
Oh, we're just friends.
EMBRY
Ooh.
Burn.
JACOB
(scrambling)
I said she's a girl and a friend.
QUIL
Embry, you remember him making that
distinction?
EMBRY
Nope.
Bella rescues Jacob --
BELLA
So I guess you guys have girlfriends.
JACOB
(laughs loudly)
Right. Quil took his cousin to prom.
Embry chuckles, as well.
QUIL
Yeah, that's still a riot. You want
funny, Black? I'll give you funny.
Quil makes a run at him, he dodges; a playful scuffle ensues.
Embry, amused, saunters over to Bella.
EMBRY
I got five bucks on Quil.
40.
BELLA
You're on.
The scuffle continues.
Off Bella, enjoying them...
A SERIES OF SCENES...
The bikes begin to take shape, the parts on the blanket thin
out.
BELLA (V.O.)
I never forgot my reason for doing
what I was doing...
Jacob clowns for Bella's amusement, pretends to skewer
himself with a pipe. She laughs.
BELLA (V.O.)
But being with Jacob was a bigger perk
than I expected...
He constantly touches her, playful, affectionate. It's
effortless in contrast to Edward's intense restraint. We
can see her spirits beginning to lift.
Bella SCREAMS in her sleep. The light turns on and Charlie
hurries to her side, gently shaking her awake.
CHARLIE
You're alright, Bells.
You're okay.
Her eyes open, tears streaming down her cheeks. He doesn't
quite know what to do, so hands her a glass of water from
her bedside table. She sits up, sips. He pulls the
dreamcatcher from her bedpost.
CHARLIE
This thing's not working very well.
BELLA
It's... not as bad as it was.
CHARLIE
Yeah right.
(beat)
I know what it's like, you know. When
your mom left me. I had a hell of a
time. Imagined doing all kinds of
crazy things, just to stop the pain.
She avoids his look.
CHARLIE
But hanging out with Jacob seems to
help get your mind off... things.
BELLA
He's been keeping me afloat.
CHARLIE
That's good. He's a good guy.
Off Bella...
42.
Bella drives along the La Push cliffs. Jacob rides shotgun.
He studies a grease-blackened motorcycle crankshaft.
JACOB
We got lucky at the dump. You know
how much a new crankshaft goes for?
BELLA
Sure, I spend all my free time on
crankshaft-dot-com.
JACOB
I think that's a porn site.
(then)
These bikes are gonna be rolling soon.
Where should we ride first?
BELLA
Someplace sunny.
JACOB
Like there's any place sunny around
here.
BELLA
I know a place above the cloud line --
The second she says it, she regrets it -- off her --
FLASHPOP TO - THE MEADOW, Bella lying in the grass with
Edward ("Twilight"), flowers surrounding them.
JACOB (O.S.)
Where is it?
BACK ON BELLA - her face falls.
BELLA
Actually, it's... too hard to get to.
He brings his easy smile and optimism to the rescue.
JACOB
So we'll find our sunny spot, right?
She smiles, grateful. Then she looks out the window at the
cliffs... and notices --
43.
BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE BY THE CLIFF
FOUR MEN stand on the rocky ledge of the cliff (Sam, Jared,
Paul, and a fourth). They wear nothing but cut-off shorts.
They push each other, rough-housing.
BELLA
Isn't that... Sam Uley?
JACOB
(bitter)
And his cult.
Suddenly, two of the guys throw a struggling Jared over the
cliff! BELLA SLAMS on the brakes. Jumps out of the truck --
Jacob climbs out after her --
BELLA
Oh my God!
Stop them! --
Bella carries her tray to an empty table, but looks over at
Mike, Angela, Jessica and Eric. Bella takes a breath, then
casually joins them. They take note, but keep talking.
JESSICA
I'll kill Tyler if he gave me his flu.
ANGELA
It's going around. My sister was so
sick she couldn't come on our hike
this weekend... so she didn't see it.
ERIC
(sotto)
Ang, maybe you should keep that to
yourself --
ANGELA
We saw something, Eric.
ERIC
I believe you.
JESSICA
No he doesn't. He's just trying to
get lucky.
ERIC
(suddenly hopeful)
Is that an option?
ANGELA
(ignoring him)
It was jet black and huge; on all
fours it was still taller than a
person. A bear maybe.
46.
JESSICA
Or Big Foot.
MIKE
Or an alien. Lucky you didn't get
probed.
ANGELA
(quietly)
... We saw it.
She's serious.
And a little scared.
Bella see that.
BELLA
You're not the only one.
Everyone stares.
Did Bella just speak?
BELLA
My dad's been getting reports at the
sheriff's station. A couple hikers
went missing. People are scared.
Now everyone's chilled.
MIKE
I did hear some guy talking about it
at the store.
ERIC
Last time you clowns doubt my
girlfriend.
As they continue, Angela mouths "thanks" to Bella. They
share a smile and join in, Bella becoming part of the group.
CUT TO:
ECU ON JACOB AND BELLA'S FACES
-- just inches apart.
JACOB
You look scared.
BELLA
I'm not.
She's lying. PULL BACK to see she's straddling the now
completed motorcycle. Jacob stands next to her, holding the
bike up. There's an intimacy to their proximity. INCLUDE --
47.
Bella does homework. Charlie watches a game.
She's on
edge. Anxious. HEAR A BEEEEP --
BELLA (O.S.)
Hey Jake. Just checking to see how
you're doing. And to say I'm sorry,
about, you know... how I feel and...
hope the flu passes fast. Call me.
51.
Bella paces her room, not wanting to sleep/dream.
She eyes
the phone, waiting for it to ring. BEEEEP --
BELLA (O.S.)
Me again.
I just... need to hear your
voice...
Bella's on the phone, leaving yet another message, her
desperation having reached its peak. In the living room,
Charlie and Harry check their fishing gear.
BELLA
Jacob.
Please. Call me.
She hangs up, leans her forehead against the phone.
Charlie
enters --
CHARLIE
Harry and I will be back by three --
He stops when he sees her.
Puts a hand on her shoulder.
CHARLIE
It's mono, Bells.
BELLA
He's too sick to even call?
CHARLIE
You just gotta wait it out.
(then)
You know, I don't have to go fishing...
BELLA
(forcing a smile)
No, go. I'll call Jess or someone.
52.
CHARLIE
Good. But stay here or at Jess's. No
hikes or anything. We're issuing a
warning about those bears.
Off Bella's nod --
Bella BURSTS in, out of breath. Charlie and Harry
Clearwater are washing their fishing gear. Charlie spins.
CHARLIE
Bella?
What's wrong?
57.
BELLA
They're not giant bears -- I saw them.
Up in a meadow --
CHARLIE
Damn it, I told you not to go into the
woods!
HARRY CLEARWATER
What did you see, Bella?
BELLA
Wolves.
They're wolves, Dad.
We might note, though they don't, that Harry Clearwater
sighs ever-so-slightly.
BELLA
Five of them. The size of - of cars.
I swear. They went after -- something -
- and I ran.
Charlie grabs up the phone; as he dials --
CHARLIE
Harry, can you get some men from the rez?
HARRY CLEARWATER
Sure.
Yeah. I'll just --
Harry seems more concerned than gung-ho as he slips out.
CHARLIE
(into phone)
Jerry? Put a hunting party together --
tranq guns, large caliber shotguns --
there's something dangerous out there.
BELLA (V.O.)
Something dangerous. Victoria.
Her eyes dart around the house, their vulnerability spinning
in on her. As Charlie hangs up, goes to his gun cabinet --
BELLA (V.O.)
If she came after me, Charlie would
try to protect me -- and he'd die.
CHARLIE
I've gotta go to the station.
BELLA
Good! -- That's good.
58.
CHARLIE
You okay here? You want to come with?
BELLA
Actually, I -- need to see a friend.
Bella climbs in, slams the door, pissed. Starts the truck.
Then turns it off. Deciding, she tosses the keys aside and
sinks down into her seat to wait...
Bella looks out the passenger window at Billy. Suddenly,
there's a KNOCK at the driver's window. She spins to find --
JACOB standing there. But his face is shockingly different.
His hair is cropped short. No friendly smile.
59.
No warmth in his eyes. Just a hard, brooding resentment.
Bella is taken aback. She climbs out of the truck to FIND --
Bella enters, dripping wet, too listless to close the door.
Charlie's face falls when he sees the pain and lifelessness
returned to her. He grabs a blanket, wraps her in it.
CHARLIE
Billy called, said you and Jacob had a
fight. But, hey, you guys will work
it out, I'm sure of it.
BELLA
I'm... going to change.
Bella heads upstairs.
Charlie sags, helpless.
He moves to
the open door --
Bella TEARS through the forest again, searching. She turns --
finds Edward, cold, distant. But his face begins to MORPH...
... and becomes Jacob's. She reaches for him but he BOLTS
backward, suddenly many yards away.
BELLA
Why!?
He, too, retreats further, disappearing until Bella is alone.
BLACKNESS encroaches, the moonlight becoming a tiny
spotlight on her. She searches the dark - then SEES a pair
of EYES, female, blood-red - coming toward her; HEAR a loud
SCREECHING NOISE --
-- Bella tosses herself awake, slowly realizing it was just
a dream. But she HEARS the SCREECHING noise again!
Fingernails on her window. Bella bolts upright, looks
around for a weapon --
JACOB (O.S.)
(whisper shouting)
Bella! Ouch - damn it; open the window.
Bella cautiously moves to her window to find --
62.
-- Jacob lands on the balls of his feet. Bella is stunned.
He freezes, listening for Charlie. Nothing. A bitter, self-
satisfied grin spreads on his face. It pisses Bella off.
He takes in her room.
JACOB
I pictured your room more...
cluttered.
BELLA
Why are you here?
JACOB
I had to talk to you.
Alone.
BELLA
To kick me in the gut again? It was
bad before, but you made it so much
worse.
JACOB
I know. And I want to explain.
But... I can't.
BELLA
Then leave.
He stays put.
She tries to push him but he's immoveable.
BELLA
You're done with me, remember?
Get.
Out!
63.
JACOB
Bella, I literally can't explain...
She becomes aware of her hands on his bare skin and muscular
chest. The intimacy of their touch. She pulls away.
JACOB
I broke my promise not to hurt you, I
know. But I'm trying to keep it now.
I need you to understand... even if
you don't want to see me when you find
out --
BELLA
Find what out?
He starts to speak -- but can't.
It's agonizing.
She sees
he's in pain. Is concerned.
BELLA
What's wrong?
JACOB
I can't do it.
BELLA
Yes, you can. I'll help you. We
can... we can leave. Leave home,
leave Sam.
JACOB
It's not something I can run away
from.
(then)
I would run with you though. If I
could.
(beat, realizing)
Wait. Wait, I already -- I told you.
You know this -- you can guess.
BELLA
I don't want to play games with you --
JACOB
You have to! I can't tell you, but if
you remember - it was that day I ran
into you at the beach. I told you a
story -- come on! I told you a
story... about?
BELLA
... about... "The Cold Ones?" You
said it was a stupid tribal myth.
64.
JACOB
(pointedly)
Was it? Are the Cold Ones a myth?
She doesn't answer.
JACOB
What else did I say?
BELLA
That... the tribe made a treaty with
them. They can't come onto your land
and... I don't know, I don't remember.
JACOB
Try, Bella.
BELLA
You have to give me more. Tell me
where to look. Is there something I
should see -- ?
JACOB
No, that's too dangerous --
BELLA
I'll take the risk.
Jacob, show me.
He looks at her, doesn't want to but knows it's the only
way. Beat.
JACOB
Where was the last place you saw me...
the way I used to be?
BELLA
The motorcycles - that clearing in the
woods.
He nods slowly, then turns to go.
She stops him.
BELLA
Don't go. There are dangerous things
out there; more than you know.
He looks at her with a wry smile. Then pulls her into a
hug. Her cheek against his bare chest. She takes in the
closeness... then he soundlessly heads out her door. A beat
-- Bella starts pulling on clothes.
Bella drives through the darkness.
65.
BELLA (V.O.)
If I was going to lose someone else, I
needed to know why.
She pulls off the road, and drives into the forest.
Bella hesitantly enters behind Jared and Embry. She sees
EMILY, 20, at a counter, popping fresh muffins out of a tin.
SEE only one side of Emily's beautiful face, draped by long
black hair.
EMILY
You guys hungry? Like I have to ask...
Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of
her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines
that pull down her eye and twist her mouth.
EMILY
Who's this?
As Jared and Embry beeline for the muffins --
JARED
Bella Swan.
Who else?
EMILY
So you're the vampire girl.
69.
BELLA
And you're a... you're all...
EMILY
Werewolves? I'm just engaged to one.
But these animals --
(slaps Embry's hand)
Save some for your brothers.
Bella cautiously approaches the counter, keeping an eye on
the door for Jacob.
EMILY
Leave it to Jacob to get around Sam's
gag order.
BELLA
He didn't say anything, or...
couldn't.
EMBRY
That's a wolf thing. Alpha's orders
get obeyed whether we want to or not --
JARED
How `bout you shut up now, Embry?
EMBRY
You know Jacob's gonna fill her in.
JARED
Yeah, I know every stupid thought he
has.
(to Bella)
Wanna know what he thinks of you?
EMILY
Like you need special powers to know
that.
EMBRY
(to Bella)
It's another wolf thing. We hear each
other's thoughts. Good for hunting.
Embarrassing for everything else.
Jared leans to Bella, challenging.
JARED
Freaking out yet?
70.
BELLA
(meets his look)
You're not the first -- mind reader
I've met.
EMBRY
(grins)
Jake's right. You are good with the
weird.
BELLA
But I don't get -- how?
Why? --
SAM (O.S.)
-- Because there are bad things here.
She spins - Sam is now standing behind her, the front door
open behind him.
SAM
And they're getting worse.
Bella is chilled. Sam moves past her to Emily - the sight
of her instantly warms his face.
SAM
Hey, Em.
He kisses Emily's scarred face adoringly. Bella has to look
away. Their utter devotion is a painful reminder of what
she has lost. Fortunately, she's distracted by --
Jacob and Paul's arrival. They laugh and jab one another.
Bella is relieved to find Jacob unscathed. Jared and Embry
crowd them, finding a scar on Paul's arm --
EMBRY
Ha!
Pay up.
As Jared reluctantly hands Embry five bucks, Jacob's eyes
find Bella's. He nods solemnly to the door; we should talk.
CLOSE ON VICTORIA, easily controlling the steering wheel
with two fingers. She speaks to someone we don't see, her
words laced with longing and fury.
74.
VICTORIA
James hated cars. He liked being
close to the ground. But I'd steal
one occasionally, to throw him off the
scent... See, we played hide and seek
sometimes. No one can hide like me --
(grins to her passenger)
-- but no one could seek like James.
INCLUDE her barely conscious passenger, DENISE, 30's, a
pretty bleach-blonde with expensive jewelry. She's just
coming to, a bump on her head where she was knocked out.
DENISE
What -- what are you -- ?
VICTORIA
Some games
lasted months... but we
always got
hungry for each other.
(sly,
to Denise)
So I'd let
him find me...
Denise now lucid, looks around to SEE --
IN THE BACK SEAT her husband, MICHAEL'S BODY, well-dressed
in a turtle neck, 40's, sits upright, his head tilted
forward as if he's resting. Denise reaches for him --
DENISE
Michael?
Oh my God --
VICTORIA
We never could get enough of each
other...
(seething)
We would have had forever to try.
Denise, scared, shakes Michael's arm --
DENISE
Michael?!
-- which causes Michael's head to roll to the side,
revealing his gouged, blood-soaked neck and his vacant, dead
eyes. Denise starts SCREAMING. Victoria grins.
VICTORIA
James always loved a screamer.
Victoria's hand jets out, grabbing a fistful of Denise's
hair. She yanks Denise over, exposing her neck just as we --
SMASH TO:
75.
Bella enters to find it perfectly intact, lived-in, warm,
candles glowing... and the Cullen family enjoying the
evening - Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie, Emmett and Jasper.
Bella is overwhelmed with joy at seeing them.
BELLA
You're here.
But they ignore her. Won't even look at her.
She starts
toward them but suddenly --
Edward appears and YANKS Bella away, pulling her to the door
and pushing her out, slamming it on her --
77.
Bella awakens, tears on her face. She can't take it. Gets
the hell out of bed, anxious to leave the dream behind. But
it stays with her...
HARRY CLEARWATER
Nope, nothin'.
The hunting party moves forward.
Harry lets them get ahead,
stomps out the paw print.
ON CHARLIE as he passes under a huge tree --
WHIP PAN UP THE TREE to find that HIGH ABOVE, crouching on a
limb, is VICTORIA. She watches Charlie with a vengeful glare.
She noiselessly SWINGS down to a lower branch, getting ready
to pounce on Charlie --
ON HARRY - his eye catches her movement; he looks up, SEES
the back of her red head -- his breath CATCHES --
She HEARS the sound, even through the rain and wind.
Before
Harry can raise his shotgun --
Victoria's standing next to him, WHIPPING the gun out of his
hands with superhuman speed. He GASPS, breath stuck in his
chest. She grins, about to bite -- but suddenly --
THE RUSSET-BROWN JACOB-WOLF smashes into her, knocking her
away. She rights herself immediately and takes off --
THE THREE WOLVES give chase, disappearing. It all happened
soundlessly, in seconds, unbeknownst to the others...
STAY ON HARRY - he still can't catch his breath, IN SLOW
MOTION he clasps his left arm -- INTERCUT WITH --
Jacob drives. Bella wears a fleece jacket but still
shivers. He pulls her close, wrapping an arm around her --
JACOB
Hundred and eight degrees over here.
She tucks herself into him.
BELLA
Must be nice, never getting cold.
82.
JACOB
It's a wolf thing.
BELLA
It's a Jacob thing.
You're just...
warm.
JACOB
(grins)
Like the sun.
BELLA
(meaning it)
Like the sun.
JACOB
Which always comes back.
You can
count on me.
She nods.
Awkward silence.
He fills it.
JACOB
There are other cool things about all
this, like -- I heal fast. Wanna see
me stab my hand?
BELLA
(no!)
Yeah, `cause that would be fun.
The truck pulls up to the curb. It's pitch black outside.
Jacob's still holding her close as he shuts the engine off.
BELLA
So... this wolf thing's not all bad?
JACOB
It's better. Now that you know.
But...
BELLA
... but...
JACOB
It just... comes so easily to me.
More than the other guys.
BELLA
That's a good thing, isn't it?
83.
JACOB
Maybe. Or maybe it makes me less...
human than the others.
(beat, quieter)
Sometimes I'm scared I might...
disappear, you know? Who I really am.
Bella faces him, looks directly in his eyes.
BELLA
I won't let that happen.
Their faces are close... and stay close for an intimate
beat. They could kiss, their lips near... but Bella blinks
herself back to reality and pulls away.
BELLA
Thanks for driving - for everything.
-- as she pushes open her door. WIND wafts in -- Jacob
reacts to a repugnant smell outside --
JACOB
Holy crap -- !
He abruptly pulls Bella back into the truck, SLAMS her door
shut and starts the truck.
JACOB
There's a bloodsucker out there.
BELLA
How do you know?
JACOB
I can smell the stink.
I'm getting
you out of here.
As Jacob whips the truck around, the HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATE --
BELLA'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY -- a black Mercedes is parked in
front. Bella spins to the rear window as Jacob floors it --
BELLA
Stop!
It's not Victoria --
JACOB
Forget it --
BELLA
It's Carlisle's car!
They're here.
Go back! --
84.
JACOB
It's a trick --
He's still flooring it -- Bella cracks her door open while
they're moving - he SLAMS on the brakes. She jumps out --
JACOB
Damn it, Bella --
As Bella makes herself hot chocolate, Alice paces.
BELLA
Werewolves are not vicious.
ALICE
Until they lose their tempers.
BELLA
They saved me from Laurent, they're
protecting me from Victoria --
ALICE
(shocked)
Victoria? I didn't see her. I didn't
see you get pulled from the water
either.
BELLA
It was Jacob who saved me. More than
once. I couldn't have made it without
him. You have no idea what it was
like.
ALICE
(softening)
Yes. I do. I knew leaving wouldn't
be good for you. I tried to tell
Edward, but he wouldn't listen.
BELLA
(hesitantly)
... Does he know you're here?
ALICE
No.
He's been... away...
87.
A dump, empty but for a table and chair. On the table lie
THE PHOTOS that once lined Bella's walls. Edward stands in
the center of the room, stock still, staring out at the
rising sun. His face is as empty and desolate as Bella's
was after he left.
A CELL PHONE on the table RINGS jarringly. He doesn't move.
It continues. Finally, he whips the receiver to his ear,
exasperated.
EDWARD
What?
ROSALIE (O.S.)
Wow, Edward finally answered the
phone. I feel so honored...
INTERCUT WITH:
Rosalie, on the phone, stands at the picture window --
Jacob enters behind Bella.
She turns to him...
BELLA
Look, Jake, I'm sorry I --
JACOB
This place stinks to hell.
She sees he's shut down, cold.
She shuts down, as well.
BELLA
You're welcome to leave.
In fact --
JACOB
-- How many Cullens are here and how
long are they staying?
BELLA
(snapping back)
Just Alice. And she'll stay as long
as she wants.
JACOB
Are the rest coming back?
BELLA
Not that I'm aware of.
Anything else?
JACOB
That's it.
BELLA
Better go report to Sam.
Jacob turns, starts to leave. He looks back, sees her anger
turn to hurt. He stops. Beat.
91.
JACOB
I've done it again. I keep breaking
my promise not to hurt you.
BELLA
It doesn't have to be this way.
He moves back to her, looks into her eyes with sadness.
JACOB
Yeah, it does.
BELLA
Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob?
He can't answer that, but he presses his hand to her cheek.
JACOB
It was easier when we were both human,
wasn't it?
They look at one another, Jacob's hand still on her face,
his eyes searching hers.
Slowly, he starts to bend toward her lips. She doesn't pull
away. She misses him too much, needs him too badly. This
time, she'll let it happen. A kiss is a centimeter away...
Suddenly, the shrill RING of the phone makes them both jump.
Jacob, the closest to it, doesn't move his face, just keeps
looking into her eyes as he reaches for the phone, answers --
JACOB
Swan residence.
She smiles.
But he instantly bristles, voice going cold.
JACOB
He's not here. He's at a funeral...
Then the phone goes dead --
-- Edward stares at his phone crazed, enraged, grief-
stricken -- he HURLS it against the wall, shattering it.
-- Jacob hangs up the phone.
JACOB
Filthy bloodsucker.
92.
BELLA
Wait, who was it?
JACOB
(spitting it out)
Dr. Carlisle Cullen.
BELLA
You should have let me talk to him.
JACOB
He didn't ask for you --
Suddenly, Jacob's eyes go wild, his body stiffens, starts
trembling in the way that precedes a wolf-morph.
JACOB
Step away from me, Bella.
Bella turns to see what he's reacting to - Alice. She
stands in doorway looking empty, despairing. Bella
immediately hurries to her side.
BELLA
Alice, what's wrong?
ALICE
... Edward.
BELLA
What about him? What happened?
ALICE
I just saw him in a vision.
He...
thinks you're dead.
BELLA
(realizing)
That was him calling, not Carlisle.
ALICE
Bella, he's going to Italy... to the
Volturi...
OFF BELLA'S FACE -- FLASHPOPS of the CIRCULAR HALL, the
THREE VOLTURI - the DISMEMBERING of the rogue vampire --
SMASH TO:
The door SLAMS open and Bella races in, shoving clothes into
a bag. Jacob dogs her, protesting.
93.
JACOB
Why do you have to go?
BELLA
He won't believe Alice.
He has to see
that I'm alive.
JACOB
(stops her)
He left you, Bella. He didn't want
you anymore, remember?
BELLA
But I still love him, and I'm not gonna
let him kill himself out of guilt.
This wounds him. But she can't stop to soothe him.
She
pulls away and continues packing.
JACOB
What about your dad?
BELLA
I'm eighteen, legally free to go.
I'll leave a note.
Alice enters.
ALICE
Got the airline tickets.
JACOB
(squaring off with Alice)
You Cullens might hunt animals but
those monsters in Italy don't.
ALICE
I'm well aware what the Volturi are.
JACOB
Then why are you taking Bella to them
like a bottle of wine to a party?
ALICE
Right, she's better off here with
Victoria stalking her. The one you
dogs can't seem to catch?
Jacob growls, a shudder ripping through him. Bella
intercedes, stopping him from morphing by grabbing Alice.
BELLA
Let's go.
94.
Bella tries to pull on her seat belt but Alice stops her --
ALICE
Maybe Jacob's right.
(Bella tries to
interrupt)
No. You need to realize - the Volturi
could easily see me as Edward's
accomplice. And you're a human who
knows too much and tastes too good.
They could kill us all.
Bella's response is to yank her seat belt into its clip.
Alice sees she won't change her mind. She shifts into gear
and PEELS OUT. Bella looks out the window for Jacob; he's
not there... she turns toward the woods --
BELLA'S POV -- THE TREELINE -- SHREDDED CLOTHING FLIES in the
air as we SEE the HIND LEGS OF A WOLF disappear into the
forest. Off Bella, fighting tears but determined as hell...
ON EDWARD walking down a seemingly endless corridor.
Finally, he reaches a set of intricately carved double doors
which open for him. He enters --
-- Edward finds himself facing three wooden thrones, on
which sit the ancient Volturi: Aro, Marcus, Caius.
Aro wears an expensive, contemporary, black Italian suit,
long black hair in a loose ponytail to his waist.
95.
Marcus and Caius eschew modern clothing for rich silk robes,
their long hair loose around them. All three have
translucent, onion-like, white skin.
EDWARD
Have you decided?
ARO
It was an intriguing debate.
We don't
get many suicidal vampires.
CAIUS
Pathetic.
ARO
I'm afraid your gifts are too valuable
to destroy. But if you're unhappy
with your lot, join us. We'd be
delighted to utilize your skills.
EDWARD
So you won't end this.
MARCUS
Not without cause.
Edward registers this, his face setting. Clearly, he's
going to give them cause. He strides out. Off Aro...
ARO
Such a waste.
Bella grips the dashboard as Alice narrowly misses a car.
BELLA
How much time do we have.
ALICE (O.S.)
He's waiting till noon, when the sun's
at its highest...
SMASH TO:
BELLA
(checking her watch)
It's almost noon now.
ALICE
There's Volterra.
Alice punches it as Bella SEES --
BELLA'S POV - A MEDIEVAL FORTIFIED VILLAGE atop a distant
hill. Volterra.
-- ON BELLA as she drops through the darkness, to be caught
by Alice. Edward lands beside them, then Felix and Demetri.
Edward pulls Bella close as they follow Jane through the
sewer. He meets Bella's eyes, trying to look reassuring,
but he's tense as hell. Finally, they reach --
A FOLDING IRON ELEVATOR DOOR. Jane easily pulls it aside.
They all enter. As the door CLANGS shut on them --
SMASH TO:
CLOSE ON MODERN ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING. They all exit into --
An elegantly decorated space with old world charm. They're
greeted politely by GIANNA an attractive (human) receptionist.
GIANNA
Buon pomeriggio.
They head through the lobby to --
THE LONG CORRIDOR that Edward traversed earlier.
Finally,
they reach the carved double doors which open --
Bella, Edward and Alice enter to face the three ancients:
Aro, Marcus, Caius.
Eight VOLTURI GUARDS (including Jane, Felix, Demetri) line the
walls in a variety of modern dark overcoats.
102.
BELLA'S POV - THE FLOOR - there's a depression in the center
that leads to a drain. Bella shivers.
Aro rises, greets them like old friends, taking Edward's
hand and shaking it --
ARO
What a happy surprise! Bella is alive
after all. Isn't that wonderful?
Caius responds with a sour expression. Marcus could care
less. Aro doesn't release Edward's hand, looks at him as --
ARO
Her blood appeals to you so much it
makes me thirsty. How can you stand
to be so close to her?
EDWARD
It's not without effort.
ARO
(laughing)
I can see that.
Off Bella's look, Edward explains --
EDWARD
One touch and Aro can see every
thought I've ever had in my life.
ARO
You're quite the telepath yourself,
Edward. Though... you can't read
Bella's thoughts. Fascinating.
He releases Edward's hand and turns to Bella.
ARO
I would love to see if you are an
exception to my gifts, as well.
He reaches for Bella's hand. She hesitates, does she have a
choice? Aro laughs at her reluctance, further extends his
hand. Bella finally takes it.
A beat as he holds her hand... confusion sweeping over him.
ARO
Interesting.
He releases her, moves back to his chair, deep in thought.
103.
ARO
I wonder if --
EDWARD
(reading Aro's thoughts)
No!
ARO
Let's see if she's immune to all our
powers, shall we Jane?
Jane turns toward Bella but Edward springs in front of her --
Jane instead focuses her gaze on Edward which FLINGS him
across the room where he collapses, writhing in agony. Jane
concentrates on him with a small smile, enjoying his pain.
BELLA
Stop!
Bella and Alice rush to his side.
As soon as Jane looks
away, Edward's pain ceases.
ARO
Jane, dear.
The girl?
Jane's gaze now turns toward Bella who cringes, awaiting the
pain... but nothing happens. Jane's grin is replaced by
anger. Aro laughs like a child with a new toy.
Jane, infuriated, moves toward Bella, but Aro stops her with
a tiny gesture.
ARO
Remarkable! She confounds us all.
So
what do we do with you now?
MARCUS
(seemingly bored)
You already know what you'll do, Aro.
CAIUS
She knows too much; she's a liability.
ARO
That's true. Unless Edward intends to
give her immortality...
(looks at Edward)
But that's not your intention, is it.
Shame.
He nods to Felix who moves toward Bella, but he only takes a
step before Edward tackles him.
104.
BELLA
Edward, don't!
Alice leaps to help but several Volturi guard hold her back,
which is no easy job. As she struggles mightily --
Edward is David to Felix's Goliath.
Edward will lose, but
he'll go down fighting.
-- Edward is fast, anticipating Felix's moves before he
makes them, but Felix is stronger --
-- Felix grabs Edward, throws him into the ceiling, SMASHING
against the marble; he drops like a stone. Is then
immediately KICKED across the room.
BELLA
(to Aro)
Stop this! Please!
But Aro ignores her, leans forward to study Edward.
Jane is
itching to step in. Aro gestures her back.
-- Felix takes some hits, but then lifts Edward overhead,
CRACKING him like a nut, then flinging him against a wall --
Bella runs toward Aro but a Volturi Guard flings her away;
she flies HARD against the wall.
The guard is then occupied by the thrashing Alice --
Bella, bruised, but not broken, makes another attempt to get
to Aro -- finally reaches him, kneels in front of him --
BELLA
Do it!
Kill me! Just leave them
alone!
-- as she yanks her collar back, exposing her neck to him.
Aro is surprised and intrigued. A beat.
ARO
Enough.
Felix immediately releases Edward who manages to look up.
He sees Bella kneeling in front of Aro.
EDWARD
Get away from her -- !
Edward moves toward Aro but is quickly immediately pinned by
Jane's invisible powers; he writhes in agony. Alice can no
longer bear Edward's suffering --
105.
ALICE
Edward, stop. I've already seen it.
EDWARD
(through gritted teeth)
Alice, stay out of it.
ALICE
I know what to do.
Aro, intrigued, gestures for Jane to stop; Edward goes limp.
ARO
Ah yes, the clairvoyant. I saw your
gift in Edward's thoughts. What is it
you've seen?
EDWARD
... don't...
ALICE
I'm the one who will change Bella.
Bella is taken aback by this.
Aro is surprised, as well.
ARO
(beat, then gestures)
Please. Be my guest.
ALICE
Not here. Her father is in law
enforcement. If she goes missing,
there will be questions.
CAIUS
He is easily dealt with.
ALICE
It will happen, Aro.
See for
yourself.
She thrusts out her hand. Aro nods to the Guards who
release her. She gives him her hand. He closes his eyes --
SMASH TO:
BACK ON ARO, utterly delighted.
He releases Alice's hand.
ARO
Mesmerizing! To see the things you've
seen, that haven't happened yet!
Alice moves to Edward's side, helps him up.
ALICE
I'm so sorry.
ARO
(to Bella)
Your gifts will make for an intriguing
immortal. Go make your preparations.
Bella hurries to Edward's side, too.
Caius is put out.
CAIUS
You're letting them leave?
ARO
Dear Caius, the girl's disappearance
will be conspicuous at best. And
surely you see her potential.
MARCUS
(dispassionately)
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will
arrive any moment.
Aro gestures - Demetri throws open the carved double doors.
Caius glares at them threateningly.
CAIUS
We will make sure she follows through.
I would not delay. We do not offer
second chances.
Edward, recovered now, takes Bella by the arm and, with
Alice, they cautiously back toward the door --
-- Demetri leads Bella, Edward and Alice out of the hall.
As they make their way up the corridor, they see coming
toward them --
A GROUP OF TWO DOZEN TOURISTS, led by a beautiful vampire,
HEIDI. Edward, Alice and Bella stop to let them all pass.
As Heidi passes Demetri, he gives her a flirtatious smile --
107.
DEMETRI
(sotto)
Nice fishing, Heidi, save some for me.
Heidi smiles.
She gives Bella a curious once-over, then
continues on.
HEIDI
(to the group)
This way, please. Stay together...
A HUSBAND and WIFE, 60's, cameras around their necks, pass
Bella. The Husband winks at Bella --
TOURIST HUSBAND
Unusual tour, isn't it?
TOURIST WIFE
Bill, get a picture of that bust there.
As the Tourists file past, we HEAR a variety of languages,
German, Japanese, English.
The group is moved toward the carved double doors which
swing open for them. They file into the marble hall --
Edward pulls Bella forward, but she cranes her neck back as
the last of the tourists disappear inside.
As the large doors close... we begin to HEAR SCREAMING --
Edward and Alice rush Bella out - PUSH IN ON BELLA'S
TORMENTED FACE as the SCREAMING gets louder... and louder --
SMASH TO:
ON BELLA'S SLEEPING FACE as the SCREAMING CRESCENDOS --
Bella sits bolt upright, yelling --
BELLA
-- Stop!
She catches her breath, disoriented, confused. Then she
turns to find Edward lying beside her, looking at her.
BELLA
It... wasn't a dream.
EDWARD
Go back to sleep. You've been through
a lot.
108.
BELLA
No, you might --
EDWARD
I'll be here when you wake up.
Beat, she looks at him, wary.
BELLA
Why?
Out of guilt?
EDWARD
(realizing)
You... think I asked the Volturi to
kill me because I felt guilty?
BELLA
Didn't you?
EDWARD
I went to them because I thought I'd
lost you.
BELLA
You didn't even want me.
Now Edward takes her by the shoulders.
EDWARD
Bella. The only reason I left was to
protect you. I wanted you to have a
chance at a normal, happy life.
BELLA
But it was so easy for you to leave.
EDWARD
I had to be convincing. But easy?
In
my hundred years, I've never had a
harder time than what I just went
through.
She's beginning to believe him.
BELLA
I kept seeing you. Visions of you.
Always protecting me. I thought I was
going crazy.
EDWARD
Your own instincts were speaking to
you. I wish it had been me. But
you're the heroic one. You saved me.
109.
He moves to kiss her... but abruptly stops.
Suddenly --
HER DOOR swings open - she spins toward it as the LIGHTS
flip on and Charlie enters. Edward is gone.
CHARLIE
You alright? Another nightmare?
BELLA
I'm okay.
You don't have to worry.
CHARLIE
Last time you said that, you
disappeared. You want to talk
nightmares?
BELLA
(sincere)
I'm really sorry, Dad.
CHARLIE
Just... don't ever do that to me
again. Okay?
(off her nod)
And you're grounded for the rest of
your life.
BELLA
I know.
CHARLIE
Get some rest so I can keep lecturing
you in the morning.
He kisses her forehead. Exits.
A beat... she turns to find
Edward sitting on the bed.
EDWARD
He won't forgive me easily.
BELLA
Nope.
EDWARD
Will you? I don't deserve it but... I
hope you will. Because I honestly
have no idea how to live without you.
Bella melts in his eyes.
He kisses her.
BELLA
You won't be able to get rid of me
once Alice changes me.
110.
EDWARD
She won't have to. There are ways to
keep the Volturi in the dark.
BELLA
(pulling away)
They'll come after your whole family.
You'd risk that just to keep me human?
EDWARD
Just? You really don't understand
what you'd be giving up.
BELLA
I really do.
They look at each other; an impasse.
She decides something,
grabs her jeans, pulls them on--
BELLA
You're not the only one with a say in it.
CLOSE ON BELLA --
BELLA
You all know what Edward wants. And
you know what I want. But I won't
force myself on you...
INCLUDE THE ENTIRE CULLEN FAMILY who surround Bella. The
house has been restored to it's original warmth and beauty.
Edward sits off to the side as Bella addresses them.
BELLA
I think the only fair way to handle
this is by vote --
EDWARD
You can't be serious --
BELLA
(firmly)
This is my meeting, Edward.
Edward, frustrated, sits back.
She faces the family again.
BELLA
However this turns out, I'm not
letting the Volturi hurt you. I'll go
back to Italy alone --
111.
EMMETT
The hell you will.
I'm not missing
another fight.
BELLA
That's not up for a vote, Emmett.
I
don't want you involved.
ESME
We've always been involved, honey, and
we're not going to stop --
BELLA
No, please -- I want you to seriously
think about this. If I join you,
you'll be stuck with me for a long
time - forever. It's a huge decision.
And I want - I need your honesty here.
They nod or otherwise communicate agreement.
BELLA
Then let's take a vote... Alice?
Alice jumps up and hugs Bella.
ALICE
Like you're not already my sister.
Of
course, yes!
Bella smiles.
Jasper rises, but keeps his distance.
JASPER
I vote yes. It'll be a relief not to
want to kill you.
BELLA
Um.
Thanks? Okay, Rosalie?
Rosalie, torn, looks at Edward who's stony toward her.
ROSALIE
Edward, I'm sorry for what I did. I
really am. And I know you're not
ready to forgive me...
(to Bella)
But this isn't the life I'd have
chosen for myself. I wish there'd
been someone to vote no for me...
(she exchanges a glance
with Carlisle - then...)
So... no.
112.
Bella takes it stoically.
Emmett bounds over and lifts
Bella into a bear hug.
EMMETT
I vote hell yeah. We can pick a fight
with these Volturi some other way.
Esme approaches and embraces Bella warmly.
ESME
I already think of you as part of the
family. Yes.
BELLA
Thank you, Esme.
Carlisle moves, not to Bella, but to --
CARLISLE
Edward --
EDWARD
You can't go along with this,
Carlisle, you know what it means.
CARLISLE
You've chosen not to live without her,
which leaves me no choice. I won't
lose my son.
(turns to Bella)
But Alice has never turned anyone.
It'd be safer if I did it --
The front door suddenly SLAMS. Edward's gone.
Bella
blanches but turns to the family.
BELLA
Thank you.
Thank you all.
Edward drives Bella home.
He is somber.
She is resigned.
EDWARD
When?
BELLA
After graduation.
EDWARD
Just two months.
BELLA
It'll be best for Dad that way. I can
pretend to be at college somewhere.
Carlisle suggested it. But...
(quiet, emotional)
I wish you'd be the one to change me.
EDWARD
(beat)
Would you be willing to trade for that?
BELLA
(hopeful)
Name it.
EDWARD
Five more years as a human.
BELLA
The Volturi won't wait that long.
EDWARD
I'll settle for three.
BELLA
(sadly, shakes her head)
I won't risk it. It'll have to be
Carlisle.
He takes her hand.
114.
EDWARD
Why are you so willing to give up your
soul?
BELLA
Because I don't believe you've lost
yours. And I want to share mine with
you forever.
He looks to her, kisses her hand... then suddenly Edward
SLAMS on the brakes --
THEIR POV - THE ROAD
-- Someone stands in the road directly in front of them --
it's JACOB. He glares, then turns and walks into the woods.
BELLA
What is he doing?
EDWARD
He wants to talk to me.
BELLA
Well, he can talk to me first.
She pushes out of the car --
Edward and Bella tramp through the woods to FIND -- Jacob
leaning against a tree. His expression is hard.
JACOB
You're still alive.
BELLA
I've been calling you.
JACOB
Couldn't drop by?
EDWARD
He thinks I'm keeping you away.
JACOB
(spinning on him)
Stay the hell out of my head!
BELLA
Dad grounded me, Jake. We're trying
to get back before he wakes up.
115.
Jacob doesn't buy it. Bella is frustrated. But Edward
takes a step toward Jacob. Calm. Diplomatic.
EDWARD
Jacob, I know you have something to
say to me, but I'd like to say
something first. Alright?
Jacob leans back against the tree, arms folded, waiting.
EDWARD
(sincere)
Thank you. For keeping Bella alive
when I... didn't.
JACOB
No, you didn't. And it wasn't for
your benefit, trust me.
EDWARD
I know. I'm still grateful.
(then)
But I'm back now. And I'm not leaving
Bella's side till she orders me away.
She looks at him. He returns the look. Jacob sees the
devotion between them. It wounds him. But he masks it.
JACOB
We'll see.
EDWARD
Either way, we'll handle Victoria from
here on out.
JACOB
She's been laying low. Ever since
your freaky sister showed up. Guess
she can't stand you Cullens either.
EDWARD
She'll come back.
JACOB
She does, she's ours.
She killed on
our turf.
EDWARD
We'll see.
JACOB
My turn to talk. I'm here to remind
you about a key point in the Treaty.
116.
EDWARD
(reads his thoughts, nods)
I haven't forgotten.
JACOB
Good.
BELLA
What?
What key point?
JACOB
If any of them bites a human, the
truce is over. That's bite, not kill.
BELLA
(realizing)
But... if I choose it, it's none of
your business.
Jacob is horrified, starting to shake with rage.
JACOB
If you... what!? No.
No way.
I
won't let you --
EDWARD
-- Bella, step back --
JACOB
You're not gonna be one of them.
BELLA
That's not your call --
JACOB
(even more intense)
You know what we'll do to you - I
won't have a choice --
EDWARD
We're done here --
Edward takes Bella's arm, starts to pull her away.
Jacob
lunges, trying to extract Bella from him --
JACOB
You don't speak for her!
Edward PUSHES Jacob away; he flies back ten feet in the air,
but mid-air he PHASES INTO A WOLF!
117.
-- The Jacob-wolf lands on all fours, spinning to face
Edward in an attack stance. Edward shifts stance, as well,
readying for a fight --
BELLA
Stop!
Edward and Jacob circle one another, seconds from lunging --
EDWARD
(to Bella)
Get out of here. Now!
But Bella races between them, forceful, insistent.
BELLA
(to both of them)
You do this, you'll be going through me.
A long tense beat, none of them backing down - it could go
either way --
BELLA
I swear to God, I'm not moving.
Both rivals see she's dead serious. Edward backs off, ever-
so-slightly... the Jacob-wolf does the same.
BELLA
(turning to Edward)
Give me a second. Please.
Edward shakes his head.
Doesn't move an inch.
BELLA
Read his thoughts.
Is he going to
hurt me?
Edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away. But his
eyes never leave the wolf's. They glare at one another.
Bella carefully approaches the Jacob-wolf, blocking his line
of sight. Her voice is kind, pleading.
BELLA
Jacob, I love you. You're my best
friend. But... I can't change how I
feel. Please don't make me choose.
(quietly, emotionally)
Because it'll be him. It's always
been him.
118.
Anguish sweeps through the wolf's fierce face.
It's even
harder to take than when he's in human form --
BELLA
But you know how important you are to --
Suddenly, the wolf BOLTS out of there...
ON BELLA - fighting tears as she watches him disappear...
BELLA (V.O.)
There were problems ahead.
Seemingly
insurmountable...
Edward's arms wrap around her from behind.
BELLA (V.O.)
... If I didn't become a vampire, the
Volturi would kill me. If I did, my
best friend would do the job himself,
or get killed in the attempt.
She turns to face Edward, looking into his loving eyes...
BELLA (V.O.)
Victoria was still on the loose,
putting everyone I loved in danger...
He kisses her tenderly, washing away her concerns.
BELLA (V.O.)
But I'd already survived the worst --
losing Edward. So I knew I could
survive anything...
EDWARD
I'm here.
Always.
And she sees that's the truth, believes it. He takes her
hand and together they turn, heading out of the woods...
BELLA (V.O.)
And soon, I'd be like him. We'd face
our fate together. Forever.
Off them, hand in hand, inseparable... as we begin to --
FADE TO BLACK:
... HEAR the agonized HOWL of a wolf in the far distance...
