      EXT. CAMELOT MOTEL - NIGHT

      Music cue: Air s  La Femme D Argent. 

      ANGLE on a rain-streaked, neon-reflecting motel window. 
      Through gauzy curtains we see the SILHOUETTES OF LOVERS 
      heaving toward climax with all the romantic finesse normally 
      associated with Soviet farm equipment.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    I m never getting married.

      A middle-aged FAT MAN wearing a cheap, too-short, faux-
      Japanese robe and nothing else crosses through the frame 
      carrying an ICE BUCKET.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    You want an absolute? A sure thing? 
                    Well, there it is. Veronica Mars, 
                      spinster...old maid. Carve it in 
                    stone.

      CRANE SHOT follows man down a flight of exterior motel steps.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I mean, come on. What s the point? 
                    Sure, there s that initial primal 
                      drive...hormonal surge...whatever 
                    you want to call it. Ride it out. 
                    Better yet, ignore it...

      As the man reaches the ground floor level and heads toward 
      the ICE MACHINE next to the motel office, shot widens and 
      includes the wet blacktop of the parking lot and the 
      flickering neon of the CAMELOT MOTEL sign.

                                  VERONICA (CONT'D)
                    ...Sooner or later, the people you 
                    love betray you.

      As the man crosses back toward his room, CAMERA STOPS on the 
      door to the first floor ROOM 8. As the CAMERA PUSHES IN on 
      the keyhole...

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And here s where it ends up -- fat 
                    men, cocktail waitresses, cheap 
                    motels on the wrong side of town.

      REVERSE ANGLE on a nondescript sedan parked on the street 
      facing the motel. There s a figure in the driver s seat, but 
      we can see little more than that.                                                                                      2.



                                  VERONICA (CONT'D)
                    And a soon-to-be ex-spouse wanting 
                    a bigger piece of the settlement 
                    pie.

      INT. VERONICA S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      CAMERA PANS across the front seat. The first thing we see is 
      a 35 mm camera equipped with a HUGE TELEPHOTO LENS.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    That s where I come in.

      ...then a THERMOS...

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                      Twenty-two dollars an hour is cheap 
                    compared to the long-term fiduciary 
                    security sordid photography can 
                    secure for you, your offspring...

      ...then to a MATH TEXT resting in a girl s lap.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...your next lover.

      PAN follows a thermos mug of coffee from the girl s lap up to 
      her mouth. We finally see the face of our heroine, VERONICA 
      MARS. She is not cute. She is sexy. Tough. Prematurely jaded. 
      Angelina Jolie at 17.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But do us a favor. If it s you in 
                    there. Dispense with the cuddling. 
                    This motel tryst? It is what it is. 
                    Make it quick. That person sitting 
                    in a car across the street might 
                    have a Calculus exam in five... 
                    make that four...hours, and she 
                    can t leave until she gets the 
                    money shot.

      A ROAR of motorcycle engines forces Veronica to quit staring 
      at the hotel and turn her attention back toward the street.

      EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

      VERONICA s P.O.V. - five CHOPPERS ridden by tattooed and 
      helmetless males -- an eclectic mix of Latinos, Anglos and 
      Asians aged 16 through 20 -- slow down as they approach 
      Veronica s car. They gaze into her car, and their expressions 
      turn from disbelief to festive anticipation.                                                                                      3.



      INT. VERONICA S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Veronica watches the proceedings with exasperation, but 
      little sense of panic.

                                  VERONICA
                    Well, this can t be good.

      The final skinheaded rider, known throughout the juvenile 
      justice system as WEEVIL (18) slams on his brakes and comes 
      to a stop ten feet from Veronica s driver s side door. His 
      mates navigate quick 360s and end up flanking their leader.

      Weevil delivers an evil smile, jackhammers his eyebrows and 
      gives the international signal for  roll down your window. 

      Veronica sighs, turns down the car radio -- thus reducing the 
      Air score -- then holds down the buttons to electronically 
      roll down both driver s side windows.

      EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

      As two of the bikers dismount...

                                  WEEVIL
                    Car trouble, Miss?

      Off the imminent danger, we...

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO 
                                                                      MAIN TITLES                                                                                      4.



      FIRST ACT

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

      Veronica gets out of the car. She shoulders a backpack and 
      heads toward the school.

      ON SCREEN: 18 HOURS EARLIER.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL QUAD - DAY

      A HUNDRED STUDENTS have formed a tight circle around the flag 
      pole. Veronica needs to get through the circle in order to 
      enter the building. As she pushes through the crowd, we hear 
      the voices of random students.

                                    CAT-IN-THE-HAT RAVER
                    Who put him there?

                                  BAND DORK
                    Bikers did it.

                                  PEP SQUADDER 
                    Why doesn t somebody cut him down?

                                    PENCIL-NECKED GEEK
                            (sarcastically)
                    Yeah. I ll do it. I want to be the 
                    guy up there tomorrow.

      Once Veronica makes her way through the assembled students, 
      she discovers what everyone is staring at.

      REVEAL - 16-year-old WALLACE FENNEL, African American, 
      skinny, naked and duct taped to the flag pole. The tape 
      obscures any graphic flesh. The misspelled word  Snich  has 
      been shoe polished in white across his chest.

      Some CLOWN from the crowd jumps out next to Wallace and mugs 
      for a CAMERA held by his buddy. Wallace stares straight 
      ahead, refusing to meet anyone s gaze. He attempts bravely, 
      though not completely successfully, to maintain his 
      composure.

                                  VERONICA
                          (addressing the Clown)
                    Move.

                                  CLOWN
                    Who died and made you...

      The clown notices Veronica flipping open a large pocket 
      knife. He backs away quickly.                                                                                      5.



                                  CLOWN (CONT D)
                    ...Jesus. You are a freak.

      Veronica begins cutting through the tape releasing Wallace 
      bit by bit. Wallace glances at Veronica gratefully.

                                  VERONICA
                    You re new, aren t you?

      Wallace nods.

                                  VERONICA (CONT'D)
                    Welcome to Peninsula West High.
                          (disdainfully scanning the 
                            faces in the now-
                            dispersing crowd)
                    Go Pirates.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

      A teacher drones as CAMERA DOLLIES slowly down a row of 
      public high school students. There is a clear differentiation 
      between the pockets of mostly-white, wealthy kids and the 
        mostly-non-white poor kids that we see.

                                    TEACHER (O.S.)
                    Aristotle studied under Plato at 
                    the Academy, and, while there, 
                    wrote many dialogues that were 
                    praised for their eloquence. He 
                    tutored Alexander the Great at the 
                      Macedonian court, left to live in 
                    Stagira, and then returned to 
                    Athens. In 335 B.C. he opened a 
                    school in the Lyceum...

      CAMERA FINDS Veronica, her head laid flat on her desk, in the 
      last seat of the row. The teacher s voice fades out, and the 
      slow, rhythmic sound of Veronica breathing fades in.

      CAMERA PUSHES IN tighter and tighter on Veronica s closed 
      eyes. As the shot begins to lose focus, and we believe we are 
      entering Veronica s dreamland...

                                    TEACHER (CONT D)
                          (sharply)
                    Veronica! Veronica Mars!

      Students turn and stare at Veronica. The fact that she has 
      been asleep is no surprise to anyone. Veronica groggily 
      raises her head from her desk.                                                                                      6.



                                  VERONICA
                    Yes?

                                    TEACHER
                    Perhaps you can tell the class all 
                    about syllogism.

      Veronica wipes the sleep from her eyes and begins.

                                  VERONICA
                    Syllogism is a mode of argument 
                    that forms the core of the body of 
                    Western logical thought. Aristotle 
                    defined syllogistic logic. He said 
                    that every syllogism is a sequence 
                    of three propositions such that the 
                    first two imply the third. There 
                    are three basic types of syllogism: 
                      hypothetical, disjunctive...

                                    TEACHER
                          (frustrated and impressed)
                    Okay, thank you, Ms. Mars.
                          (noticing another student)
                    Mark Simpson, you can read that 
                    copy of Maxim during your own time. 
                    Your own very private time. Now... 
                    where were we?

      Off Veronica laying her head back on her desk.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FIRE LANE - DAY

        A customized VW BUG with a HUGE PLASTER GODZILLA affixed to 
      the top of it screeches to a stop in the fire lane in front 
      of the school. The DRIVER gets out, runs around the car, 
      opens the passenger side door, withdraws a HALF DOZEN LARGE 
      PIZZAS and sprints toward the school, giving a campus 
      security guard a little nod.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

      Veronica picks at a curious, gravy-covered MEAT PATTY on her 
      lunch tray, sighs. She smells the pizzas almost before the 
      delivery guy walks by her table. We can feel her salivate.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) 
                    Oh, no. Not today.

      Veronica watches intently as the delivery guy moves to a 
      section in the center of the cafeteria where tables have been 
      shoved together to create space for a DOZEN of Peninsula 
      West s BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.                                                                                      7.

                    Get this. The school board closed 
                    campus last year when teachers 
                      complained about students returning 
                    from lunch drunk or high.

      The delivery guy collects his money. In the b.g. of the shot, 
      we notice Wallace moving toward an empty chair until one of 
      the beautiful people meaningfully drapes a jacket over the 
      chair. Wallace moves away.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Of course, when the sons and 
                    daughters of the village elders 
                    bitched about cafeteria food, the 
                    powers that be implemented the 
                    Pirate Points Program. Earn enough 
                    Pirate Points and you can have your 
                    food delivered. 

      The IN-CROWD shares the pizzas. Big smiles. Jocularity. High 
      fives. Hair tousling. Flirtatious shoulder touching. 

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Look at  em. Like an ethnically-
                    cleansed Gap ad. Proud. Like Star-
                    Bellied Sneetches... Effortlessly 
                    ignoring the palpable hatred of the 
                    hoi polloi.

      CAMERA PANS, FINDS other clumps of students: brains, stoners, 
      drama freaks, band geeks, gangstas, auto shop greasers.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    And guess how you earn Pirate 
                    Points. Good grades? No. Community 
                    service? No. Sports? Cheerleading? 
                    Student council? Yes, yes and yes.

      ANGLE ON VERONICA completely lost in thought. She doesn t 
      notice Wallace sitting down across from her.

                          (then Scott)

                    Duncan Caine...

      Veronica trails off. Duncan Caine is the most beautiful of a 
      uniformly stunning group. He seems to have a halo around him.

                          to sound sarcastic)
                    He s going to be President of the 
                    United States...

      Veronica continues to lose herself in the vision of Duncan 
      Caine until Logan Hewitt steps into her field of vision. He s 
      caught her. Logan licks his lips and begins tracing rings 
      around his nipples. Veronica turns away quickly, but not 
      before she sees Logan laugh and tap Duncan on the shoulder.

                                    WALLACE (O.C.)
                    You okay?

      Veronica looks over, notices that she has a companion at her 
      table. A fact that doesn t thrill her.

                                  VERONICA
                    What?

                                    WALLACE
                    You look...I don t know... 
                      hypnotized.

                                  VERONICA
                    Did I say you could sit there?

      Wallace sighs, shakes his head, begins gathering his things.

                                  VERONICA (CONT D)
                    Wait. I m sorry. Of course you can 
                    sit there. You can sit wherever you 
                    want.

      Wallace stops what he s doing, eyes Veronica.                                                                                      9.



                                    WALLACE
                    That was cool...earlier...what you 
                    did. Cutting me offa that pole.

                                  VERONICA
                    Yeah... Well...
                          (preparing to stand)
                    Don t mention it.

      Before Veronica makes it all the way up, a handful of the 
      members of the P.C.H. Bike Club including Weevil surround the 
      table. Weevil sits down and positions himself well within 
      Wallace s personal space. When he speaks, he is inches from 
      Wallace s face.

                                  WEEVIL
                    My bitch. Weren t you supposed to 
                    wait for me at the flag pole. Not 
                    sure I could ve made that any 
                    clearer.

                                    WALLACE
                            (frightened, attempting to 
                            laugh it off)
                    Okay, I get it. Very funny. I guess 
                    we re even now.

      Veronica takes this in. She stops preparing to leave.

                                  WEEVIL
                    You get what, bitch? You get that 
                    you re a dead man walking. Is that 
                    what you get?

                                  VERONICA
                    Leave him alone.

                                  WEEVIL
                    When I want you to open your mouth, 
                    you ll hear me unzipping.

                                  VERONICA
                          (chuckles dismissively, 
                            then...)
                    Take it out. Right here. Right now. 
                    If it s more than four inches, I ll 
                    be your girlfriend. We ll go to 
                    prom together. Come on, let s see 
                    it.

      Wallace s jaw drops. As Weevil finally gives Veronica his 
      undivided attention, Veronica leans over at a table of gaping 
      freshmen girls.                                                                                    10.



                                  VERONICA (CONT D)
                    Hey, you. Got a ruler with you? 
                    Maybe a protractor?
                          (off their wide-eyed 
                            silence)
                    McNugget? Stick of gum?
                          (turning her attention 
                            back to Weevil)
                    What? What seems to be the problem?
                          (tapping watch)
                    I m on a schedule here, vato.

      One of the other bikers, we ll call him JESUS, becomes overly 
      concerned that his homie is getting shown up publicly.

                                  JESUS
                    C mon, Weevil. Whip it out. Don t 
                    let girlie girl talk that shit.

                                  VERONICA
                    Sounds like your buddy here wants 
                    to see it, too..

                                  JESUS
                          (reaching down to his fly)
                    Hell, I ll show you mi...

      A HAND enters frame and grabs Jesus by his collar. The hand 
      belongs to assistant principal VAN CLEMMONS.

                                  MR. CLEMMONS
                    Jesus Garza, what on God s green 
                    earth do you think you re doing?

      Jesus doesn t respond. He just stares icily at Veronica.

                                  MR. CLEMMONS (CONT D)
                    All right, fellas. Let s move 
                    along. Wendell, come with me.
                          (looking back)
                    Veronica, why does trouble follow 
                    you around?

      The bikers move along, but not without making intimidating 
      kissy faces at Veronica, whispering what can only be threats 
      in Spanish and Vietnamese. Eventually Wallace and Veronica 
      are left alone at the table.

                                  VERONICA
                    So what d you do that has them so 
                    pissed off?                                                                                    11.



                                    WALLACE
                          (still mesmerized)
                    What?

                                  VERONICA
                    Why are you a dead man walking?

                                    WALLACE
                    Oh. I work at Sac-N-Pac. And last 
                    night, I was working by myself, and 
                    a couple of those guys came in.

      INT. SAC-N-PAC - NIGHT

      Wallace reads an X-MEN COMIC behind the counter of the 
      otherwise deserted store when HECTOR (20, Latino) walks in, 
      trailed by his muscle-bound Vietnamese gangmate, PHUONG (19.) 
      The pair heads directly back to the beer cooler.

      As Wallace observes, Phuong and Hector start stuffing huge 
      overcoats with a good dozen, or so, 40S OF BEER.

                                    WALLACE (V.O.)
                    They just walk right to the back of 
                    the store, and start stuffing all 
                    these 40s into, like, a hundred 
                    pockets.

      Wallace reaches under the counter and pushes A SILENT ALARM, 
      begins eyeing the parking lot, nervously.

                                    WALLACE (CONT D)
                    So, I hit the silent alarm.

      ANGLE ON THE SECURITY CAMERA MONITORS next to the cash 
      register. The  heist  is getting caught on tape. Hector and 
      Phuong begin walking toward Wallace. The SOUND OF BOTTLES 
      CLINKING together is impossible to miss.

      Hector picks up a pack of gum and sets it down on the 
      counter. Hector surprises Wallace by pulling a ONE DOLLAR 
      BILL out of his wallet. He points at the gum.

                                  HECTOR
                    That ll do it.
                          (sticking the bill in 
                            Wallace s shirt pocket)
                    Keep the change. You re doing a 
                    bang up job, here. Employee of the 
                    month material. Seriously.

      Wallace finds himself unable to speak as the pair exits..                                                                                    12.



      WALLACE S P.O.V. -- a moment later, a police car, flies into 
      the parking lot with it s lights flashing.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

      We return to Wallace telling the story to Veronica.

                                    WALLACE
                    That s when the police came.

                                  VERONICA
                    We don t have police here. We have 
                      a sheriff s department.

                                    WALLACE
                          (who makes this 
                              differentiation?)
                      O...kay... That s when the car with 
                    the flashing lights showed up.

      INT. SAC-N-PAC - NIGHT

      Sheriff Don Lamb (40, intimidating, gruff, oddly unsettling 
      inappropriate smile) enters the store.

                                    SHERIFF LAMB
                    You. Come here.

      Wallace walks out from behind the counter.

      EXT. SAC-N-PAC - CONTINUOUS

      Wallace walks outside, and what he discovers scares the hell 
      out of him.

      REVEAL - FIFTEEN MEMBERS of the P.C.H. BIKE CLUB -- including 
      the ones we ve already met -- sitting on choppers out in the 
      parking lot. Every biker seems to be staring holes through 
      Wallace.

      DEPUTY SACKS (doughy, late 20s) has Hector and Phuong 
      handcuffed and bent over the hood of the cruiser.

                                    SHERIFF LAMB
                    They say they paid.
                          (annoyed by Wallace s 
                            silence)
                    Well? Did they?

      Off the hard, hard stares of the assembled bikers.

                                    WALLACE
                    Yeah.                                                                                    13.



                                  HECTOR
                    Like I said.

                                    SHERIFF LAMB
                    Shut up.
                          (back to Wallace, 
                            condescending)
                    But you pressed the alarm, anyway?

                                    WALLACE
                    It was an accident.

      Lamb shakes his head in disgust and heads into the store.

                                    SHERIFF LAMB
                    What a pussy.

      WALLACE S P.O.V. - Lamb goes behind the counter and removes 
      the VIDEO TAPE from the surveillance system. He comes back 
      out of the store and addresses his deputy.

                                    SHERIFF LAMB (CONT D)
                    Sacks, get them in the car. We ve 
                    got enough here.
                          (then to Wallace)
                    Grow up. Get some balls.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

      Veronica addresses Wallace. Her curiosity is piqued.

                                  VERONICA
                    Grow up. Get some balls -- he said 
                    that?

                                    WALLACE
                    Yeah.

                                  VERONICA
                      Congratulations.

                                    WALLACE
                    What?

                                  VERONICA
                    You ve already managed to piss off 
                    the duly elected Sheriff of Playa 
                    Del Costa.

      Off Wallace s  can things get worse  expression.                                                                                    14.



      INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

      Veronica reads at her desk. Her classmates are goofing off.

                                    TEACHER 2 (O.C.)
                    Veronica?

      Veronica looks up from her homework, sees a teacher holding 
      up a PINK PASS.

                                    TEACHER 2 (CONT'D)
                    They need to see you at your 
                    locker.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

      Veronica walks down the hall.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    Random locker searches. It s the 
                    latest Gestapo tactic the 
                      administration has adopted in their 
                    war on drugs. Except the searches 
                    aren t really random. I know when 
                    they re going to happen before Vice 
                    Principal Clemmons does.

      Veronica turns a corner. She discovers herself in a hallway 
      alone with Duncan Caine who is walking toward her in the 
      opposite direction. The two walk toward each other in 
      complete silence. Veronica looks at Duncan, but he doesn t 
      glance in her direction. Once Duncan has passed...

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    He was more attentive the year he 
                    was my boyfriend.

      Veronica turns another corner. She finds Vice Principal 
      Clemmons and Deputy Sacks (who we recognize from Wallace s 
      flashback) holding the leash of a GERMAN SHEPHERD.

                                  DEPUTY SACKS
                          (darkly enthusiastic)
                    Veronica Mars! This should be good.

      Clemmons shoots Sacks a  don t be a moron  look.

                                  MR. CLEMMONS
                    Veronica, please open your locker.

      Veronica begins doing her locker combination. As she does, 
      the German shepherd begins to whine, then bark.                                                                                    15.



                                  VERONICA
                    Helga, heel!

      The dog stops whining and barking, and sits quietly at 
      attention as Veronica finishes her combination. Deputy Sacks 
      is frustrated by Veronica s control over his dog. Veronica 
      opens her locker and lets the police and the assistant 
      principal get a look inside.

      REVEAL the interior of the locker. There is absolutely 
      nothing inside. Not even a scrap of paper.

                                  VERONICA (CONT D)
                    A little anti-climactic, huh?

      A QUICK PAN of the deputy and principal reveals that, yes, 
      they expected something more.

      EXT. THE COMMODORE APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

      Veronica arrives at a low rent apartment complex. She enters 
      a courtyard through a metal gate. An EMPTY SWIMMING POOL 
      occupies most of the courtyard. A couple feet of standing 
      brackish water tells us that the pool is out of service.

      As Veronica walks past the swimming pool, Coldplay s  DON T 
      PANIC,  begins playing out of an open apartment window.

                                  COLDPLAY
                    We live in a beautiful world/Yeah, 
                    we do.../Yeah, we do...

      Veronica whips her head up toward the window. As she does, we 
      hear the huge SPLASH of someone CANNONBALLING into the pool. 
      Veronica turns her attention back toward the pool, but when 
      she does, she s no longer at the Commodore, she is in...

      EXT. MARS BACKYARD - FLASHBACK - DAY

      ...and surfacing at the side of the pool is Duncan Caine. He 
      smiles up at Veronica and speaks.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Hey, baby. It s our song.

      Veronica glances up and sees a full dozen bathing-suit-clad 
      beautiful people from the cafeteria -- including Monica, 
      Scott, Lucy and Logan -- gathered around a table on the patio 
      of a gorgeous upper-middle class house.

      Angle on Veronica attempting vainly to compute what she s 
      seeing. Then...                                                                                    16.



                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.C.)
                    Happy birthday, Veronica. Are you 
                      surprised?

                                  VERONICA
                          (lighting up)
                    Mom? MOM?

      But when Veronica turns, she is back in...

      EXT. THE COMMODORE APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

      Veronica s P.O.V. - elderly, African-American neighbor 
      ESTELLE WHITE is attempting to get through the gate with an 
      arm load of GROCERIES. She gives Veronica a quizzical look.

                                  MRS. WHITE
                    It s me, honey. Can you give me a 
                    hand?

      Mrs. White takes Veronica out of her trance. Veronica gives 
      one last look back at the brackish pool, shakes the cobwebs 
      from her head, and jogs toward the gate.

                                  VERONICA
                    Yeah, sure. No problem.

      INT. MARS APARTMENT - DAY

      Veronica is greeted at the door by a very affectionate and 
      excited PIT BULL.

                                  VERONICA
                    Oh, look at you. Who s been a good 
                    boy, today? Who s been a good boy?

      The pit bull clearly thinks he s been a good boy.

      SERIES OF SHOTS - 

      Veronica spooning a HUGE CAN OF DOG FOOD into a bowl while 
      the pit bull waits impatiently.

                                  VERONICA (CONT D)
                    Okay. Attack.

      The pit bull does so, with gusto.

      Veronica pours a POWDER PACKET into a pot of MACARONI.

      Veronica puts the finishing touches on BOLOGNA AND CHEESE 
      SANDWICHES. Cuts them.                                                                                    17.



      Veronica places Tupperware BOWLS OF MAC AND CHEESE, an APPLE 
      and SANDWICHES into PAPER BAGS.

      Veronica grabs a LEASH hanging from a hook and attaching it 
      to the excited pit bull s collar.

      EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

      Veronica sits at a picnic bench. She throws a tennis ball and 
      the big pit bull chases it down with frightening efficiency. 
      She hears an odd sound -- the HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING of a 
      small engine. Looking up, Veronica spots a RADIO-CONTROLLED 
      AIRPLANE doing laps around the park sky.

      Veronica scans the park until she spots the plane s owner.

      VERONICA S P.O.V. - Wallace Fennel operates an antennaed 
      radio control unit some 75 yards away. He s already seen 
      Veronica. He looks down from the plane, gives Veronica a 
      pleasant wave and smile.

      Veronica smiles despite her best intentions. She offers 
      Wallace a SELF-CONSCIOUS WAVE in return. As she observes him, 
      we get a sense that Veronica is being won over by him. 
      Whether it s his bravery in showing up outdoors by himself or 
      a kinship derived from a their similar solitary statuses.

      EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

      Veronica gets out of her car at a low-rent downtown 
        intersection carrying the lunch sacks. She moves toward a 
      door next to a liquor store. She stops when she sees a JAGUAR 
      CONVERTIBLE parked in front of the door.

      CLOSE ON the license plates which read  CAINE 2 

      Veronica attempts to absorb what this might mean as she makes 
      her way to the door.

      STENCILLED on the door are the words: MARS INVESTIGATIONS.

      Veronica opens the door and a small bell above the door 
      rings. She immediately begins climbing stairs. The office 
      itself is above the liquor store.

      INT. MARS INVESTIGATIONS, OUTER OFFICE - DAY

      Veronica enters the outer office. She can hear the MUFFLED 
      VOICES of her father and a client in the office. Veronica 
      tries to listen to no avail. We hear the JINGLE OF THE BELL.                                                                                    18.



      Public Defender CLIFF MCCORMACK (35, oily like William Hurt 
      in Body Heat) enters without knocking and catches Veronica 
      attempting to listen at her father s office door. 

                                  MCCORMACK
                          (grinning, too loud)
                    Veronica Mars!

      Veronica furrows her brows and shakes her head in silent 
      attempt to silence McCormack.

                                  VERONICA
                    My dad s with a client.

                                  MCCORMACK
                      Apparently. That s okay. I m happy 
                    to sit out here and chat with you. 
                    I ve got a case...

                                  VERONICA
                    Like I said, my dad s with a 
                    client...

                                  MCCORMACK
                          (knowing, toying with her)
                    Yeah. I heard you. But, c mon, your 
                    dad s out skip tracing half the 
                    time, and, yet, somehow, all the 
                    cases that come in here still get 
                    handled. How is that?

                                  VERONICA
                    We re efficient.

                                  MCCORMACK
                    Emphasis on the we. Look. I m just 
                    going to leave this file here, open 
                    on your desk, if you choose to take 
                    a look at it, cool.
                          (sliding a folder toward 
                            Veronica)
                    One of my clients, Brandy Diamonds, 
                    dances at the Seventh Veil.

                                  VERONICA
                    Classy.

                                  MCCORMACK
                    Yeah, well, everyone deserves a 
                    defense. She was busted for 
                      vandalism, taking a baseball bat to 
                    a washing machine that stole her 
                    quarters at Suds-N-Stuff.                                                                                    19.



                                  VERONICA
                    Wow. Sounds like you really need a 
                    P.I.

                                  MCCORMACK
                    Here s the thing. She says that the 
                    Seventh Veil has an interesting way 
                    of keeping their liquor license. 
                    She wants to make a deal.
                          (standing, moving toward 
                            door)
                    If your dad has time, he should 
                    look into it.

      McCormack winks, then exits. Veronica looks down at the 
      folder for a pregnant moment. Sighs. She reaches for it...

      Before Veronica can open the folder, however, CELESTE CAINE, 
      (42, glamorous, icy) steps out of the office followed by 
      KEITH MARS (45, average-Joe looks, cheap suit, rings under 
      his eyes.) Celeste is talking as she emerges from the office. 
      She doesn t see Veronica initially.

                                    CELESTE
                    Don t get the wrong idea, Mr. Mars, 
                    I don t like you. I hate the fact 
                    that I m here. But I do know that 
                    if there s anyone who will be 
                    dogged and resourceful in this 
                    matter, it will be...

      Celeste finally notices Veronica. She gives Veronica the sort 
      of once over one might give to rotten meat.

                                    CELESTE (CONT D)
                    ...you. Don t call the house. I ll 
                    get a hold of you. I ll need it 
                    soon. 

      Celeste exits. Veronica s jaw is on the floor as she turns 
      her attention to her father who is, likewise, flummoxed. 
      Veronica rolls her chair to the window and gazes out of it.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    I suppose you can understand her 
                    anger. After all, my dad did try to 
                    send her husband to jail for 
                    murdering their daughter. Then 
                    again, she was a bitch even before 
                    that. She never thought I was good 
                    enough to date her son.

                                                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    20.



      ACT TWO

      INT. MARS INVESTIGATIONS - DAY

      Veronica and Keith eat the dinners that Veronica prepared 
      earlier. There is a closeness, an us-against-the-world vibe 
      to their chemistry.

                                  KEITH
                    How was school?

                                  VERONICA
                    If you think we re going to talk 
                    about my school day and not the 
                    fact that Celeste Caine was in your 
                    office ten minutes ago, you ve got 
                    another thing coming.

                                  KEITH
                    Making good grades?

                                  VERONICA
                    Her husband s got something on the 
                    side, doesn t he?

                                  KEITH
                          (lifting a forkful of 
                            macaroni and cheese)
                    Say what you want about real 
                    cheese, I m a fan of the orange 
                    powder packets.

                                  VERONICA
                          (exasperated)
                    Okay. School was school. Locker 
                    searches. Drug sniffing dogs. 
                      Motorcycle gangs terrorizing 
                    diffident sophomores. The social 
                    elite ostracizing the poor and 
                    huddled masses. My grades are fine. 
                    I like the orange powder, too. Now, 
                    tell me about Mrs. Caine.

                                  KEITH
                    Yes. She thinks he s seeing 
                    someone. Late nights. Motel 
                    matches. The usual.

                                  VERONICA
                    Sexual appetite?

      Keith looks at his daughter. It s moments like this that he 
      fears he s not raising her  appropriately.                                                                                     21.



                                  KEITH
                    Gone.

                                  VERONICA
                    They were never a good couple 
                    anyway.

                                  KEITH
                    You re jumping to conclusions.

                                  VERONICA
                    You take the case?

                                  KEITH
                    We need the money, Veronica.

                                  VERONICA
                    Good. I would ve been pissed if you 
                    hadn t.

                                  KEITH
                            (good-naturedly)
                      I wouldn t have cared if you were. 
                    Give me some of that apple.

      Veronica smiles at her father, hands him an apple section. 
      The PHONE RINGS. Veronica answers it before the first ring 
      has ended. We get the sense that Keith might have let the 
      machine get it during dinner.

                                  VERONICA
                    Mars Investigations.
                          (beat)
                    Just a sec.

      Veronica hands the phone to Keith.

                                  KEITH
                    Keith Mars.
                          (beat)
                    How long ago?
                          (beat)
                    What s he driving?
                          (beat)
                    All right. All right. I ll get the 
                    7:30 out of Santa Cruz and meet you 
                    at the place by the thing by the 
                    fountain. Yeah. And, Andy...good 
                    work. Thanks.

      Keith hangs up and stands. Dinner is over. He s on the move. 
      Keith begins going through an overnight bag, sifting through 
      its contents.                                                                                    22.



                                  KEITH (CONT D)
                    My guy s on the move. Andy picked 
                    him up in San Diego. Another day 
                    and he ll probably try to cross the 
                    border. I ve gotta head out.

                                  VERONICA
                    You go. I ll have the flight booked 
                    by the time you get to the airport. 
                    You want a rental car in San Diego.

                                  KEITH
                    Nothing fancy this time, Veronica. 
                      Seriously.

                                  VERONICA
                    A Blazer isn t that fancy, and we 
                    bill it anyway.

      Keith gives his daughter a look.

                                  VERONICA (CONT D)

                    And don t do anything on the Caine 
                    case. I ll handle it.

                                  VERONICA
                    Okay.

                                  KEITH
                    Given our relationship with that 
                    family, I just don t think...

                                  VERONICA
                    Fine. I said okay.

      Keith puts on a shoulder holster followed by his rumpled 
      sports coat.

                                  KEITH
                    With any luck, I ll be home 
                    tomorrow night. If not, the night 
                    after. I ll call and check in.

                    You always do.

                    And, Veronica...?                                                                                    23.



                                  VERONICA
                    Yes?

                                  KEITH
                    When you go out after Jake Caine... 
                    take backup.

                                  VERONICA
                    I always do.

      Keith kisses his daughter s forehead and heads out the door.

      EXT. HILLSIDE ROAD - DUSK

      Veronica is parked in her car on a hillside road.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    I read somewhere that in Rio De 
                    Janeiro the wealthiest citizens, 
                    those with European blood, live in 
                    the valley next to the ocean, and 
                    poor people, the dark-skinned 
                    Indians who work in their houses 
                    and shops, live in hovels in the 
                      surrounding mountains.

      VERONICA S P.O.V. - The 15 million dollar CAINE ESTATE is in 
      the foreground. Behind it is the PACIFIC OCEAN.

                                  VERONICA (V.O) (CONT D)
                    It s the opposite here. More 
                      millionaire s per capita in Playa 
                    Del Costa than any town in 
                      California, and they all want a 
                    view of the ocean. They just don t 
                    want to get wet or sandy.

      JAKE CAINE (43, handsome, fit, dangerous -- think Ari 
      Emannual) emerges from the house. Veronica reaches up and 
      turns over the ignition as it begins to rain.

      Caine pulls his RANGE ROVER with plates that read CAINE 1 out 
      of the private drive. Veronica waits a moment, then follows.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)

      EXT. CAINE SOFTWARE - NIGHT

      Veronica follows Jake Caine until he pulls into the private 
      drive of the what looks like a SCALED-DOWN GETTY MUSEUM. As 
      the Range Rover disappears into underground parking, CAMERA 
      HOLDS on the CAINE SOFTWARE sign.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    Streaming video. You wouldn t have 
                    it if it weren t for Jake Caine and 
                    the fine people at Caine software.

      Veronica whips into a parking spot where she can have a view 
      of the building. The lights on the top two floors of the five 
      story building are off.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    As the legend goes, he spent 16 
                    months holed up in a Holiday Inn 
                    suite with a handful of college 
                    computer science buddies until they 
                    emerged with a killer ap that would 
                    change the way we thought about 
                    computers and the internet. He made 
                    300 million the day the company 
                    went public. Everyone, in fact, who 
                    worked on the project became a 
                      millionaire.

      As Veronica watches, a the lights in a huge corner suite 
      office turn on.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    That s why, when Jake s daughter, 
                    Lilly...
                          (Veronica momentarily 
                            loses her detachment)
                    ...my friend, Lilly...didn t make 
                    it home from a dance team car wash 
                    fund raiser, everyone assumed she d 
                    been kidnapped. 

      EXT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - FLASHBACK - DAY

      MUSIC CUE:  Lady Marmalade.  The Christina Aguilera version.


      Twenty or so cute teenaged girls scrub and rinse their peers  
      cars.                                                                                     25.


      Short-haired, cute as a button, fellow dance teamer 15-year-
      old Veronica watches with amusement as Lilly dances while she 
      scrubs.

                                  VERONICA
                    God, Lilly, aren t you Little Miss

                    Girls! Less talk. More scrub.

                                  LILLY
                          (rolling her eyes, then 
                            mouthing to Veronica)
                    Later.

      EXT. CAINE ESTATE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

      Veronica, still in her car-washing clothes -- sits in the 
      passenger seat of a sheriff s cruiser, an In-N-Out sack in 
      her lap. The entire Caine living room area is visible through 
      huge floor to ceiling glass walls.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    I ll never forget that night. Dad 
                    and I were coming home from In-N-
                    Out when the call came in.

      VERONICA s P.O.V. - her father, dressed in full sheriff 
      regalia -- is talking to Jake and Celeste Caine. Even from 
      this distance he shows obvious empathy. Another sheriff s 
      department car with flashing lights arrives.

      As Veronica watches, then-deputy, DON LAMB gets out of the 
      car and heads toward the house. He notices Veronica in the 
      car and shoots an imaginary hand pistol at her, smiles and 
      winks before heading in. It s meant as playful, but it s 
      absolutely the wrong time and place. Veronica rolls her eyes.

      Veronica spots her boyfriend Duncan Caine rocking back and 
      forth on the end of a couch. Though she was told to stay in 
      the car, she gets out and enters the house behind Lamb.

      INT. CAINE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Veronica silently makes her way to Duncan. She kneels down in 
      front of him and puts her hands on top of his.                                                                                    26.



                                  VERONICA
                          (w/absolute conviction)
                    My dad will find her.

      Duncan looks up through teary eyes. Registers hope. Veronica 
      notices something curious behind Duncan. Keith has noticed 
      something on the carpet. He reaches down, feels it, sniffs 
      his fingers. He is clearly bothered by something.  Jake is 
      consolong Celeste, so they don t notice what Keith is doing. 

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - FLASHBACK - DAY

        Fifteen-year-old Veronica scans the hallway. She is waiting 
      for someone.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    But no ransom note ever came, and 
                    my dad never found Lilly.

      Veronica stands on her tip toes, spots Duncan making his way 
      down the hall. He is accompanied by Logan and Scott.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    A couple of months later, no one 
                    was looking for a kidnapper. They 
                    were looking for a body. And a 
                    murderer.

      Buoyed by his buddies, Duncan passes Veronica in the hallway 
      without even acknowledging her.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I learned the hard way that what 
                    people were saying was true -- my 
                    dad was going after Jake Caine.

      EXT. CAINE SOFTWARE - NIGHT

      As Veronica observes, the lights at the top of Caine software 
      turn off. She starts her car.

      EXT. CAMELOT MOTEL - NIGHT

      Veronica pulls into the exact spot she was in for the cold 
      open. She observes as Jake gets out of his car, makes his way 
      to the door of one of the rooms and knocks.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    So Mrs. Caine was right. Not a lot 
                    of high powered business meetings 
                    taking place at the Camelot at one 
                    in the morning.

                    They say the divorce rate is twice 
                    as high for parents who lose a 
                    child.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB - FLASHBACK - DAY

      Veronica at 15. She notices a group of incredulous boys 
      surrounding a computer monitor.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                     Lose a child.  Now there s a 
                    euphemism for you. Lose a child.

                                  VERONICA (CONT D)
                    What? You guys figure out some way 
                    to unlock the porn?

      The boys turn their attention to Veronica. They look busted, 
      but indignant. Angry, even. One of the boys addresses the boy 
      at the keyboard.

                                  YOUR FAVORITE BAND SUCKS T-SHIRT

                                  BOY AT KEYBOARD
                    It s her Barney Fife dad who needs 
                    to see it.

                                  VERONICA
                    What?

                                  YOUR FAVORITE BAND SUCKS T-SHIRT
                    It s the Lilly Caine video.

      Veronica goes white. 

                                  VERONICA
                    Trust me, my dad s seen it. But no 
                    one is supposed to have that.

                                  BOY AT KEYBOARD
                    Yeah, well, it s on the net, so 
                    it s too late now. Take a look.

      Veronica hesitates.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    The video had arrived a week 
                    earlier. All anyone knew is that it 
                    confirmed that Lilly was dead.

                    And that the killer had a sick 
                    sense of humor. He sent it on 
                    streaming video.

      Veronica s curiosity gets the better of her. She steps toward 
      the computer monitor.

      ANGLE ON THE MONITOR - where a Real Time-esque video begins 
      to play. The image on screen is horrific.

      The LIFELESS BODY of Lilly Caine is completely submerged in 
      fifteen feet of ocean water, her eyes wide open. She is 
      wearing the same CAR WASH OUTFIT that Veronica last saw her 
      in. FISH, including small SHARKS, circle her. It s only a 
      matter of time before they begin feeding.

                                  YOUR FAVORITE BAND SUCKS T-SHIRT
                    So...? Your dad still think Lilly s 
                    own father did this?

      Veronica rushes out to vomit. She won t make it in time.

      INT. MARS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

      A QUICK PAN of the room reveals that most of the possessions 
      have been boxed. The Mars will be moving out soon.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    Whether or not my father still 
                    thought Jake Caine was responsible 
                    became a moot point. An emergency 
                    recall election removed him from 
                    office.

      CAMERA FINDS Veronica positioned on the couch. She is bathed 
      in the light from the television. Her hair is still short, 
      though she has dyed the tips. She is starting to become the 
      Veronica Mars we know today. Veronica manages to ignore the 
      muted SOUNDS OF A MAN AND WOMAN ARGUING behind her.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Mom wanted to move out of Playa Del 
                    Costa. The loss of status, loss of 
                    income, loss of reputation was too 
                    much for her. We were going to 
                    move, all right. We had to. But Dad 
                    wasn t going to be run out of town,

                    Dad! Come here.

      Keith appears, approaches Veronica from behind the couch.                                                                                    29.

                                  VERONICA
                    Look.

      ANGLE ON THE TELEVISION where a special news bulletin is 
      being broadcast.

      ON SCREEN, new sheriff Don Lamb is leading a man in handcuffs 
      through a crowd of reporters. Lamb is once again wearing an 
      INAPPROPRIATE SHIT-EATING GRIN.

                                  NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                    The Playa Del Costa sheriff s 
                      department, reacting to information 
                    received through the Crimestopper 
                    hotline, has apprehended Abel 
                    Koontz, a disgruntled former Caine 
                    software employee...

      The news camera pushes in tighter and tighter on the face of 
      ABEL KOONTZ. In his 50s, Koontz has the face one might expect 
      from the Boogeyman. Koontz stares without remorse into the 
      camera. There can be no doubt: he s a murderer.

                                  NEWSCASTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Koontz, a software designer, was 
                    fired during the development stage 
                    of the streaming video project.

      NEW SHOT - Don Lamb standing on the deck of a houseboat 
      holding up a couple items: a backpack and a pair of shoes.

                                  NEWSCASTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Shoes and a backpack belonging to 
                    the deceased were discovered on 
                    Koontz s houseboat by Sheriff Don 
                    Lamb who said...

      Veronica doesn t hear anymore as Keith has used the remote to 
      turn off the TV. Veronica looks up at her father, reads the 
      pain in his face before he heads back to the bedroom.

      EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

      The five members of the P.C.H. Bike Club that we met in the 
      cold open, cruise down the street, weaving in and out of 
      traffic, raising hell, terrorizing lost tourists, hopping up 
      on sidewalks, making kissy faces at female motorists.                                                                                    30.



      They turn down a nearly deserted road. We notice the 
      flickering neon of the CAMELOT MOTEL ahead of them. The first 
      biker notices Veronica s car parked along the side of the 
      road. He points it out to the others.

      TIGHT ON WEEVIL s FACE as he realizes what it is. Weevil 
      skids to a stop in front of Veronica s car, makes the 
      international gesture for  roll down your window. 

      As Veronica electronically rolls down both passenger windows.

                                  WEEVIL
                    Car trouble, Miss?

      Veronica scans the five guys positioned around her car. Two 
      of the bikers are dismounting. One moves toward her.

                                  VERONICA
                    Yeah, as a matter of fact. I think 
                    it s a loose belt, but if you 
                    wouldn t mind checking under...

      As she s speaking, the dismounted biker, let s call him 
      MOUTH, approaches Veronica. He s reaching in to grab her as 
      he s talking to his leader.

                                  MOUTH
                    Hey, Weevil, who gets...

      But as soon as Mouth s hand gets close to Veronica, a BLUR 
      from the back seat EXPLODES outward.

      Suddenly, Veronica s pit bull has Mouth on his back. Mouth s 
      wrist is in the pit bull s mouth. The pit bull growls, but 
      seems to be awaiting further instructions.

                                  MOUTH (CONT D)
                    Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Get him 
                    offa me.

                                  VERONICA
                    Backup! Chill!

      We now understand what Veronica s father meant by  Take 
      Backup.  Backup lowers his growling, but he doesn t let go of 
      Mouth. Jesus is off his chopper in a heartbeat.

      Jesus comes straight at Veronica aggressively.

                                  JESUS
                    Girl, you better get your dog offa 
                    him.                                                                                    31.



      Jesus lifts Veronica s door lock and begins to open her door. 
      Veronica reaches out and applies a police-issue STUN GUN to 
      her attacker. Jesus drops like a rock. Veronica steps out of 
      her car, her door already partially open. She addresses a 
      surprised, yet darkly-amused Weevil.

                                  VERONICA
                    Tell you what. We ll call a truce.

                                  WEEVIL
                    Oh, baby. It s too late for that.

                                  VERONICA
                    You leave that kid at school alone 
                    for a week, and I ll make sure your 
                    boys walk.

      The other bikers shoot looks at Weevil. This is big.

                                  WEEVIL
                    How you gonna make that happen?

                                  VERONICA
                    I could explain it, but you just 
                    wouldn t understand it.

      Weevil knows he s being insulted. Two can play that game.

                                  WEEVIL
                    So why you care so much for that 
                    skinny negro? Things I heard about 
                    you...he must really lay the pipe 
                    right.

                                  VERONICA
                    Yeah. That s it.

      Veronica and Weevil notice Jesus crawling bravely toward 
      Veronica s feet. Veronica pushes a button on her stun gun and 
      we see the sparks fly between the connection points.

                                  WEEVIL
                    All right, Jesus, we get it. You re 
                    a badass. But for once don t be 
                    stupid.

                                  VERONICA
                    Not bad advice.

      Weevil looks up at Veronica, smirks. He gets her point.                                                                                    32.



                                  WEEVIL
                    All right. A week. After that, 
                    we ll come for you, your boy...
                          (using Wicked Witch voice)
                    ...and your little dog, too.

      Backup growls.

                                  VERONICA
                    Backup. Be cool.

      Backup lets Mouth s wrist go, and allows him to crawl out 
      from under him. Weevil smiles at Veronica, the lust quotient 
      is extremely high. As Mouth and Jesus make their way back to 
      their choppers...

                                  WEEVIL
                    Yeah. That s not bad advice, 
                    either. You be cool, Veronica Mars. 
                    And if you get lonely out here 
                    sitting by yourself in your car, 
                    remember, Weevil love you long 
                    time.

      Weevil punctuates his overture by KICK STARTING his chopper. 
      The other bikers follow suit. Veronica issues an ironic 
      thumbs up to the proposition. She watches as the bikers drive 
      off into the night.

      CAMERA PUSHES IN on Veronica s face as she watches them go. 
      There s a hint of sadness.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    Quite a reputation, I ve got, huh?
                          (beat)
                    You want to know how I lost my 
                      virginity?
                          (another beat)
                    So do I.

      INT. MONICA RIVERS  HOUSE - NIGHT

      A happening party. FORTY, or so, OF THE BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL 
      from Peninsula West High cavort in a mansion overlooking the 
      Pacific. Though she is in a pretty, WHITE PARTY DRESS, 
      Veronica s DYED TIPS are terribly out of place.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    I tried to put on a brave face, 
                    hold my head high after the arrest 
                    of Abel Koontz. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    33.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I went to a party just to show 
                    everyone that their snide whispers 
                    and backstabbing didn t affect me.

      Veronica moves through the party. No one will catch her eye 
      let alone speak to her. She is a pariah.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    It was a mistake.

      INT. MONICA RIVERS  HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Veronica pushes through a crowd waiting to get in a BATHROOM. 
      As she gets to the end of the hallway, she realizes someone 
      has put a DRINK in her hand. She glances back, but she has no 
      idea who did it. She considers for a moment, then drinks it.

      EXT. MONICA RIVERS  HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

      Veronica staggers her way toward an outdoor chaise.

      VERONICA S P.O.V. - the people staring at her as she makes 
      her way to the chaise are BLURRY. She s either unimaginably 
      drunk from one drink, or she s been slipped something.

      INT. MONICA RIVERS  POOL HOUSE - DAWN

      Veronica wakes up alone on an UNMADE BED. Like the audience, 
      she has no idea where she is. She is completely disheveled. 
      There s no way to hold her head that doesn t hurt. Veronica 
      struggles to sit up on the edge of the bed. She spots 
      something on the carpeting that disturbs her.

      REVEAL a pair of panties wadded up a few feet from the bed.

      Veronica leans down and picks them up. She stands and makes 
      her way, uncomfortably, to an adjoining bathroom.

      INT. MONICA RIVERS  POOLHOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Veronica stares at herself, notices the BROKEN STRAP on her 
      dress. She runs some water, dips her fingers in, then reaches 
      down and feels between her legs. Veronica begins to sob.

      EXT. MONICA RIVERS  POOLHOUSE - DAWN

      Veronica, having put herself together as best as she can, 
      steps out of the poolhouse. We see the remnants of a party. 
      Garbage. Bottles. Cigarettes. Veronica s expression is no 
      longer pitiful. It is defiant. No one will see her cry.                                                                                    34.



      EXT. ROAD IN FRONT OF MONICA RIVERS  HOUSE - DAWN

      Veronica arrives at where she s parked her car. Her tires 
      have been slashed. A circle has been shoe polished on the 
      windshield to indicate where the driver will be sitting, and 
      the word  SLUT  has been scrawled next to it.

      Displaying no emotion, Veronica walks around the car and 
      discovers a different sentence on the back windshield. This 
      one reads...ABEL, IT SHOULD VE BEEN HER.

      Veronica absorbs this, then turns and begins making the slow 
      walk down the hill into town.

                                                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    35.



      EXT. CAMELOT MOTEL - NIGHT

      The door of the room Veronica has been staring at for the 
      past two hours finally opens. The first person out is a WOMAN 
      IN HER MID 20S, pretty.

      SNAP - the image is frozen for a moment as Veronica takes the 
      first of many photos.

      Jake Caine steps out of the motel room. He helps the mystery 
      woman with her coat.

      SNAP - Veronica freezes this image as well.

      ANGLE ON VERONICA sitting in the car taking photos.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    C mon. Give me the money shot.

      But it doesn t happen. There is no overt act of affection. 
      The pair make their ways separately to their cars as Veronica 
      continues to take photos. Off Veronica s mild frustration.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING

      Veronica is arriving for school. Again, she is exhausted. As 
      she moves toward the school, a big LEXUS SUV with SURFBOARDS 
      strapped to the roof pulls up beside her. Logan Hewitt rolls 
      down the window and speaks.

                                  LOGAN
                    Hey, Ronnie. We ve decided we d 
                    rather surf than study today. Wanna 
                    come with?

      Veronica looks up at the Lexus. She notices Duncan in the 
      passenger seat refusing to look in her direction. Three more 
      guys are in the back seat. One is sucking down a CORONA. The 
      other is WAGGLING HIS TONGUE through his first two fingers at 
      Veronica. Veronica doesn t dignify the query with a response 
      which only eggs Logan on further.

                                  LOGAN (CONT D)
                    C mon. Duncan ll promise to take 
                    off his shirt.

      The guys in the back seat cackle. Duncan shoots Logan an 
      angry look. Then, assertively...

                                  DUNCAN
                    Shut up.                                                                                    36.



                                  LOGAN
                    All right. All right.
                          (holding flask out window, 
                            waggling it)
                    What do you say to a little hootch?

      Veronica keeps walking, gives Logan the finger.

                                  LOGAN (CONT'D)
                    What s the matter? Aren t you your 
                    mother s daughter? Now, there was a 
                    woman who would do anything for a 
                    drink. What s she up to nowadays? 
                    Maybe she ll join us. You know 
                    where she is? Any clue?

                                  DUNCAN
                    C mon. Let s just go.

                                  LOGAN
                    She used to be fun.

      Logan hits the gas, and the car squeals out of the parking 
      lot leaving Veronica to stew.

      CAMERA PUSHES IN ON VERONICA S FACE...

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    It s been a year since I ve heard 
                    from my mother.

      INT. KEITH MARS S CAR - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

      Veronica at 16 sits in the back seat of the family car and 
      watches while Keith pulls a staggering ABBIE MARS out of a 
      bar and into the car.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    She became a basket case, this 
                    drunken mess, during the Lilly 
                    Caine investigation.

      INT. VERONICA S BEDROOM - FLASHBACK - MORNING

      Veronica-at-16 awakens, finds a note in an envelope on the 
      night stand next to her bed.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    She said good bye in a note that 
                    she left by my bed. She didn t even 
                    bother to wake me up.                                                                                    37.



      Veronica, having perused the note, stands and heads to the 
      bathroom, crumpling and tossing the NOTE into a WASTE BASKET.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

      Veronica sketches something in a NOTEBOOK. She looks like 
      she s really concentrating on it.

      REVEAL the sketch. It s of an ERECT PENIS that seems to stand 
      on its SCROTUM BASE.

      A GIGGLE alerts Veronica that others are watching. She looks 
      up, notices a BOY and GIRL staring wide-eyed at her sketch. 
      Veronica gives them a hard look, and they turn away quickly.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

      Veronica enters, discovers that Wallace has taken a seat by 
      himself at her table. She considers for a moment, then goes 
      over and wordlessly takes a seat. Wallace studies her, then&

                                    WALLACE
                    You should hear some of the shit 
                    people say about you.

                                  VERONICA
                    So what are you doing sitting here?

                                    WALLACE
                    You sat next to me.

                                  VERONICA
                    This is my table.

                                    WALLACE
                          (slides hand across table)
                    And what a fine table it is.
                          (rapping it with knuckle)
                    What do you suppose this is made 
                    of? Oak?

                                  VERONICA
                          (allows a smile, then...)
                      Seriously, if people are saying 
                    such awful things...

                                    WALLACE
                    Well, I figure I ve got a choice. I 
                    can hang with the motherfuckers who 
                    laughed and took pictures when I 
                    was taped to that flagpole, or I 
                    can hang with the chick who cut me 
                    down.                                                                                    38.



      Veronica weighs the sincerity of Wallace s words. It s not 
      easy for her to trust anyone. Finally...

                                  VERONICA
                    So...you wanna get the P.C.H. Bike 
                    Club off your ass?

      Off Wallace s intrigued and hopeful look.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL ART CLASSROOM - DAY

      CORNY, a dreadlocked white senior in a ZIPPY THE PINHEAD T-
      shirt, looks up from a NOTEBOOK and begins laughing 
        uncontrollably. Behind Corny, we notice rows of student-
      crafted pottery and the door to a KILN.

                                  CORNY
                          (finally able to speak)
                    Oh my god! Oh my god! This is so 
                    twisted. I love it.

      REVERSE ANGLE reveals Veronica and a confused Wallace.

                                  VERONICA
                    So you can do it? We need it fast.

      Wallace leans in, takes a look at whatever Corny is finding 
      so damn funny. Wallace gives Veronica a  what s wrong with 
      you  look which Veronica ignores.

                                  CORNY
                    Hell, yeah. For you, anything. You 
                    know what would be cool? Veins. 
                    Purple. Thick.

                                  VERONICA
                    Go to town.

      Off Corny looking like he ll do just that.

      INT. TINY DARK ROOM - DAY

      SERIES OF SHOTS that show....

      Veronica moving an 8 X 10 print from tray to tray.                                                                                    39.



      In the final tray, the image becomes clear. It s a CLOSE UP 
      OF THE WOMAN exiting the Camelot with Jake Caine.

      Veronica dries TWO PRINTS with a blow dryer. The prints 
      appear to be identical. Veronica studies them, chooses one, 
      crumples the other and throws it in a TRASH CAN.

      INT. VERONICA S BEDROOM - DAY

      Veronica steps out into her bedroom, and we realize that she 
      possibly the only teenaged girl in the world who has replaced 
      her walk in closet with a DARK ROOM.

      WIDE SHOT reveals that the room is neither the stuffed animal 
      and boy band postered room of a certain breed of teen girls. 
      Nor is it done in the black on black on black affectation of 
      the Sylvia Plath set.

      Veronica s room, rather, shows an almost complete lack of 
      effort. There s a bed on which Backup rests, his tail wagging 
      in anticipation. A wardrobe. A chest of drawers and a desk. 
      The only bit of decoration in the room: the wall above her 
      desk has been covered in CHEAPLY-FRAMED BLACK AND WHITE 8 X 
      10s much like the one she s holding in her hands.

      As Veronica gathers materials from her desk, CAMERA REVEALS 
      the subjects of these photos: all images of infidelity, hung 
      like trophies, hung like reminders.

      INT. MARS APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Veronica is plowing through homework at the kitchen table 
      when Keith enters. He looks like he hasn t slept since 
      leaving the previous night, but he s in a great mood.

                                  VERONICA
                    And?

                                  KEITH
                    Who s your daddy?

                                  VERONICA
                    I hate it when you say that.

                                  KEITH
                    This is very important. Remember 
                    this: I used to be cool.

                                  VERONICA
                          (dubious)
                    When?                                                                                    40.



                                  KEITH
                      Seventy-seven. Cruising the hard 
                    streets of Omaha. Trans Am. Blue 
                    Oyster Cult in the eight track. 
                    Foxy, stacked blonde riding 
                    shotgun. Racing for pink slips.
                          (considering, joking)
                    No. Wait. I m thinking of a 
                      Springsteen song. Scratch 
                      everything. I was never cool.

                                  VERONICA
                    I don t know which bothers me more: 
                     foxy  or  stacked. 

      Keith slaps a check on the table.

                                  KEITH
                    Nailed our bail jumper a hundred 
                    yards from Me-hee-co. Twenty-five 
                    hundred dollars. No sack dinners 
                    tonight. Tonight we eat like

      Off Veronica s smile.

      EXT. MARS APARTMENT PATIO - NIGHT

      Keith grills a couple of steaks on a Hibachi. He s grooving 
      as he s flipping the meat, spicing it. Veronica watches her 
      father; we can see why, when everyone else turned on Keith 
      Mars, Veronica never did. She loves the man.

                                  VERONICA
                    Jake Caine went to the Camelot last 
                    night, met some sweet young thing.

                                  KEITH
                    Didn t I say something about you 
                    not getting involved in that?

                                  VERONICA
                      I remember you saying to take 
                    Backup.

      Backup, lying nearby, lifts his head at the mention of his 
      name. Keith focuses on the meat for a pregnant beat. He has 
      not given his daughter a normal life. Finally...

                                  KEITH
                    You get pictures.                                                                                    41.



                                  VERONICA
                    No money shot, but, yeah, a couple 
                    pretty good shots of the woman in 
                    question.

                                  KEITH
                          (giving up, smiling)
                    Lemme see.

      INT. VERONICA S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      As Keith and Veronica arrive in the bedroom, Veronica takes 
      the PHOTO off her desk and hands it to her father, betraying 
      a hint of pride in her accomplishment. Keith moves into the 
      light to take a look. Almost immediately, the good mood 
      Keith s demonstrated all evening is gone. He looks as though 
      he s seen a ghost.

                                  KEITH
                    Stay away from Jake Caine. I don t 
                    want you doing anything else on 
                    this case. We re dropping it, 
                    anyway. I ll let his wife know.

      Veronica is dumbfounded.  What just happened?  As Keith exits 
      the room, Veronica starts to follow him.

                                  VERONICA
                    We re dropping the case? What s 
                    wrong? Who is that?

      INT. MARS APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Veronica follows her father.

                                  VERONICA
                    Why can t you just tell me...

      Keith stops and spins back toward Veronica. Then, sharply...

                                  KEITH
                    Veronica. No. It s done. Over with.

      Veronica is stung. Her father doesn t usually talk to her 
      like this. She s left to stew in the hallway.

      INT. MARS APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Two hours later, Keith Mars has fallen asleep on the living 
      room couch. Veronica snaps a leash onto Backup s collar and 
      heads out into the night.                                                                                    42.



      INT. VERONICA S CAR - NIGHT

      We re inside Veronica s car. CAMERA ONCE AGAIN PANS across 
      the front seat, finding Veronica s usual stake-out equipment. 
        Telephoto-lensed camera. Video camera. Coffee thermos. 
      Backpack. Homework.

      VERONICA S P.O.V. - We find that Veronica s not tailing Jake 
      Caine. Instead, we discover that Veronica is positioned 
      outside of THE SEVENTH VEIL, the strip club that public 
      defender Cliff McCormack mentioned to her in the first act.

      REAR VIEW MIRROR P.O.V. - A SHERIFF S CAR approaches.

      Veronica scrunches down. As the sheriff s car passes and 
      turns into the Seventh Veil parking lot, she sits back up, 
      observes.

      INT. VERONICA S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Veronica gets home from her stakeout, takes her camera into&

      INT. DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Veronica begins unrolling her film, but as she does, she 
      notices the LEFTOVERS from her photo printing from the Jake 
      Caine case. She pauses. She knows she should be done with 
      this, but curiosity gets the better of her. She picks up a 
      contact sheet and the PHOTO LOUPE.

      VERONICA S P.O.V. - through the magnification provided by the 
      LOUPE, we see a frame in which Jake and the young woman are 
      parting company. The woman is getting in her car. We don t 
      see anything particularly interesting in the photo, but 
      Veronica does. She takes a negative strip out of its sleeve 
      and turns off the lights.

      INT. DARK ROOM - 20 MINUTES LATER

      Veronica flips the lights back on and exits the dark room. 
      CAMERA PANS to the photo bath, FINDS the print Veronica has 
      just produced. It s not of Jake or the woman. It s a BLOWN UP 
      PHOTO of the front of the woman s car. Her LICENSE PLATE is 
      now easy to read.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY

      Wallace stands next to the CARD CATALOG, attempting, not-
          terribly-successfully, to look nonchalant. As he s standing 
      there, he hears the sound of quiet sobs coming from behind a 
      book shelf. Wallace looks around, decides no one else is 
      going to do anything. He steps around the book case.                                                                                    43.



      REVEAL a sophomore girl weeping freely, using the book case 
      to hold her up.

                                    WALLACE
                          (with real empathy)
                    Hey...you okay?

      As the girl looks up.

      ANGLE ON VERONICA entering the library, moving purposefully. 
      She heads straight to the card catalog. She s clearly not 
      pleased that Wallace isn t waiting there. Veronica turns a 
      corner, spots Wallace behind the book shelf talking quietly 
      with the upset sophomore girl.

                                  VERONICA
                    C mon. It s time.

      Wallace says something else to the girl that we can t hear, 
      pats her on the shoulder, and moves to catch up with Veronica 
      who hasn t waited to see the conclusion of their interaction.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

      Wallace struggles to keep pace with a speed-walking Veronica.

                                    WALLACE
                    Hey, Flo-Jo, slow your ass down.

      Veronica stops suddenly, holds her hand in a  stop  gesture.

                                  VERONICA
                    Stop. Here.

      Wallace rolls his eyes. This is not a girl in need of 
      assertiveness training.

                                    WALLACE
                    What are we...?

      Veronica points down the hall, where we discover Logan 
      arguing with Vice Principal Clemmons and Deputy Sacks. A 
      smile blooms slowly on Veronica s face. She looks down at her 
      watch and nods just before the SCHOOL BELL RINGS.

      As students fill the hallways, Deputy Sacks begins leading a 
      furious Logan down the hall by his arm.

      CLOSE ON DEPUTY SACKS  HAND. In it is a huge, PENIS-SHAPED 
      BONG. Corny has done his job.

      Students begin putting two and two together.                                                                                     44.


      They become hysterical as they spot the COCK BONG and the 
      asshole getting led away. Logan is humiliated. He doesn t 
      stop his ad-libbed rant to Sacks until he spots a smirking 
      Veronica observing the scene. Logan has an epiphany.

                                  LOGAN
                    You! It was you. I know it was you. 
                    You bitch. I ll get you for this. 
                    This isn t over. 

      Veronica feigns a yawn as Clemmons attempts to quiet Logan. 
      Once Logan has been led away...

                                    WALLACE
                    You re right. That was funny.

                                  VERONICA
                    Meet me at my car after school. 
                    Let s see if you ve done your part.

      EXT. COURTHOUSE/SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

      Angle on a well-maintained, modern building, lovingly 
      landscaped. The sheriff s department cars and a sign lets us 
      know where we are.

      INT. VERONICA S CAR - DAY

      Veronica is parked across the street. Wallace sits next to 
      Veronica nervously eyeing the building.

                                    WALLACE
                    We could get in a lot of trouble.

      Veronica exhales in frustration.

                                  VERONICA
                    Give it here.

                                    WALLACE
                    Hold on. I m gonna do it. I just 
                    thought one of us should state the 
                    obvious.

      We now see what s in Wallace s hand. It s the RADIO 
      CONTROLLER to his model airplane. He extends the antenna, 
      takes a deep breath, and flips a switch.

      INT. LARGE CLOSET - DAY

      A PAN along a ROW OF SHELVES on which rest TVs, CAR STEREOS, 
      DVD PLAYERS, etc. CAMERA EVENTUALLY finds the PENIS BONG 
      which suddenly begins to belch smoke.                                                                                    45.



      INT. VERONICA S CAR - DAY

      Veronica and Wallace observe the station.

                                    WALLACE
                    I wonder if it worked.

                                  VERONICA
                    We ll know in a minute.

      INT. SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - LOBBY - DAY

      A WOMAN with a shock of white hair cutting through her dyed-
      black beehive hair-do looks over at a closet with a small 
       Evidence  plaque on the door. Smoke has begun to billow out 
      from under the door.

      The woman jumps up from her desk, rushes over to the door, 
      opens it. A wave of black smoke collapses on her. She 
      SHRIEKS, then rushes over to the PHONE and dials 911.

      INT. VERONICA S CAR - DAY

      We re on Veronica and Wallace as we begin to hear sirens in 
      the distance. Veronica looks over at Wallace, smiles.

                                  VERONICA
                    It worked.

      INT. SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - LOBBY - DAY

      A COUPLE FIREMEN enter the lobby. They move efficiently over 
      to the evidence room.

      WE RE TIGHT on one of the firemen as he leans his head into 
      the room. He moves over to a FIRE EXTINGUISHER on the wall, 
      takes it down and enters the evidence room. We hear the SOUND 
      OF THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER making short work of the  blaze. 

      INT. FIRE HOUSE - LOUNGE - DAY

      A couple young firemen play pool at a table. One looks up 
      from a shot, his eyes widen.

      REVEAL Veronica entering the room, looking for someone.

                                  YOUNG FIREMAN
                    Well, hello. Is there anything I 
                    could possibly do to be of 
                      assistance?

      Before Veronica can respond, an OLDER MAN S VOICE responds.                                                                                    46.



                                    FIREMAN BILL (O.C.)
                    She s seventeen, Wilson.

      REVEAL Fireman Bill (late 30s.) He s the fireman we saw with 
      the fire extinguisher. Now he s boiling pasta on a stove. 
      Wilson shrugs; Veronica s age doesn t matter much to him. 
      Bill uses his finger to motion for Veronica to follow him.

      INT. FIRE HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

      Veronica follows Bill out into the garage. He turns and 
      presents her with a big envelope.

                                    FIREMAN BILL
                    Here s what you wanted.

                                  VERONICA
                    Thanks, so much. This is going...

                                    FIREMAN BILL
                          (cutting Veronica off, he 
                            wasn t comfortable doing 
                            this)
                    Your father s a good man. He was 
                    great cop. I owed him. But we re 
                    even now.

      Veronica nods solemnly. She catches his drift. She takes the 
      envelope and heads out of the station.

      INT. MARS INVESTIGATIONS - DAY

      Veronica enters, takes a seat at her outer office desk. She 
      pulls a spiral notebook out of her backpack. Inside, she 
      finds the blown up photo of the license plate.

      Veronica weighs her options. She glances at her father s 
      office door. She doesn t disobey him often. Finally, she can 
      stand it no longer. She picks up the phone and dials.

                                  MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Carmel P.D.

                                  VERONICA
                          (in harsh German accent)
                    Tony, it s Inga. Guess what? Our 
                    computers is down again.

                                  MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Inga! Upgrade already. This must be 
                    the tenth time.                                                                                    47.



                                  VERONICA
                    You preach to the choir, Tony. 
                    Listen, we had a hit and run last 
                    night. Victim got the plates, and 
                    we need someone to run them.

                                  MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    No prob. Hit me.

                                  VERONICA
                    Four. V. G. Zero. Zero. Zero.

      Veronica waits as we hear the FAINT SOUNDS of Tony TAPPING 
      AWAY ON A COMPUTER. Then...

                                  MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Jesus Christ.

                                  VERONICA
                          (suddenly very curious)
                    Ja? Vat is it?

                                  MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    That car is registered to one Abel 
                    Koontz.

      QUICK POP - a CLOSE UP of Koontz s face as he s being taken 
      into custody by Don Lamb.

      Veronica inhales sharply at the news

                                  MALE VOICE (CONT'D)
                    Must be a heck of a trick. Hit and 
                    run at night, back in his death row 
                    cell by light of day...

      Off Veronica s astonishment.

                                                                END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    48.



      ACT FOUR

      INT. PRISON VISITOR CHECK-IN - DAY

      CLOSE ON A STANFORD UNIVERSITY ID that features a photo of 
      Veronica Mars. The name on the card is SANDY WILLIAMS.

        A humorless, uniformed FEMALE PRISON GUARD scrutinizes the 
      card, then looks up at Veronica.

                                  PRISON GUARD
                    The death penalty, huh?

                                  VERONICA
                    It s my senior project. Koontz will 
                    be the twelfth I ve interviewed.

                                  PRISON GUARD
                    I ll see what I can do.

      Veronica pulls a fax out of a notebook.

                                  VERONICA
                    Uh. I received this fax. My request 
                    for interview was granted by...

                                  PRISON GUARD
                    I ll see what I can do.

      Veronica can do little more than nod. She turns and heads to 
      the only available chair in the crowded waiting room.

      INT. PRISON VISITOR CHECK-IN - LATER

      Veronica is bored out of her skull. She is reading one of the 
      available copies of Time Magazine. The cover story concerns 
      the death of Princess Di. A voice from the counter.

                                  PRISON GUARD (O.S.)
                    Williams.

      Veronica looks up.

      INT. PRISON HALLWAY - DAY

      The prison guard walks Veronica down a drab hallway.

                                  PRISON GUARD
                    Fifteen minutes is the max time. Do 
                    that button on your blouse. No 
                    sense getting him riled up.                                                                                    49.



      Veronica looks down at her blouse. She isn t showing the 
      least amount of skin, but there is one undone button right at 
      her neck. She buttons it rather than argue.

      INT. PRISON VISITATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      On Veronica s side of the room, there is a BANK OF SIX 
      PHONES. VISITORS we may recognize from the lobby shot are on 
      this side of the room. Prisoners, presumably, are on the 
      other, but they aren t visible, yet, as the visiting stations 
      are separated by PARTITIONS.

                                  PRISON GUARD
                    All the way down. Number six.

      Veronica nods. She makes her way to the far end of the room, 
      glancing at the animated conversations between frightening, 
        ORANGE-JUMPSUITED PRISONERS and their guests. When she makes 
      it to her CUBICLE, Koontz is already seated across from her.

      Koontz s penetrating stare makes Veronica feel immediately 
      naked. She reflexively reaches up, makes sure that her top 
      button is indeed done. She picks up the available PHONE.

                                  VERONICA 
                    Hello. My name is Sandy Williams. 
                    As my letter stated, I m a 
                    sociology student at Stanford. I m 
                    working on a project...

                                  KOONTZ
                    You look just like your mom, 
                    Veronica Mars.

      Veronica is stunned. Koontz enjoys seeing her flustered.

                                  KOONTZ (CONT D)
                    So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

                                  VERONICA
                    How do you know who I am?

                                  KOONTZ
                    Like I said, you look just like 
                    your mother.

                                  VERONICA
                    How do you know my mother?

                                  KOONTZ
                    Tell me why you re here, Veronica.                                                                                    50.



                                  VERONICA
                    Research.

      Koontz stares at Veronica for a beat. Registers mild 
        disappointment, then hangs up the phone and stands. Veronica 
      shouts into the phone and smacks the glass with her palm.

                                  VERONICA (CONT D)
                    No! Wait!

      A GUARD on the far end of the room, takes note of the 
      exchange, but doesn t move any closer. Koontz sits and picks 
      the phone back up.

                                  VERONICA (CONT'D)
                    I ll tell you.
                          (off Koontz s silence)
                    I saw Jake Caine meet a woman at 
                    this motel in Playa. She left in a 
                    white Honda Accord. Your Honda 
                    Accord.

      Koontz considers for a beat, then laughs, unnerving Veronica.

                                  KOONTZ
                    I see. I see. You discovered some 
                       mysterious  connection between 
                    Jake Caine and me, and you so want 
                    to believe that misguided father of 
                    yours is...was...right...right 
                    about something...anything...that 
                    you ve come here for confirmation. 
                    I wish I could do that. I do. But I 
                    can t. Your father was a patsy. He 
                    was wrong about everything, and he 
                    nearly did the impossible...turn 
                    Jake Caine into a sympathetic 
                      character.

                                  VERONICA
                          (growing angry)
                    Who was in your car? What was she 
                    doing with Jake Caine?

                                  KOONTZ
                    Do your homework. Visiting me... 
                    that was step C. You completely 
                    skipped step B.

                                  VERONICA
                    Why was your car...                                                                                    51.



                                  KOONTZ
                    That was my daughter. She went to 
                    beg Caine to spare my life. He s 
                    close with the governor, you know. 
                    Caine would ve said no, but the 
                    sadistic fuck likes to take the 
                    meeting, because he knows that it s 
                    sweeter if he can get her hopes up. 
                    I ve told her not to try, but what 
                    can I say? She loves her father. 
                    Daughters tend to.

                                  VERONICA
                          (disbelief)
                    You. You re calling Jake Caine 
                    sadistic?

                                  KOONTZ
                    He built his empire with my brain, 
                    then dumped me, destroyed my 
                      reputation. The ideas, the code, 
                    the vision that built that company 
                    ...mine. That s my house he s 
                    living in. That s my yacht he 
                    sails. My private plane he flies. 
                    Hell, by all rights, I should be 
                    your father.

      It takes Veronica a long beat to realize what Koontz is 
      implying.

                                  VERONICA
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                  KOONTZ
                    Oh, come on, Veronica. An 
                      inquisitive girl like you? Anyone 
                    ever tell you you look like your 
                    father?
                          (off her silence, smiling)
                    No. Of course not. Keith Mars, he s 
                      a mid-Western rube. All forehead 
                    and teeth. But could you be the 
                    product of the Peninsula West High 
                    1978 king and queen of the prom? 
                    The bold and the beautiful? That I 
                    can see. That makes sense. You want 
                    to know how I know who you are, 
                    Veronica? Back in  86, when we were 
                    just getting Caine software off the 
                    ground, I saw a lot of your mother. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    52.

                                  KOONTZ (CONT'D)
                    She d come over, paper bags in 
                    hand, draw the blinds in Jake s 
                    office and take long lunches. Very 
                    long lunches, indeed. Now, I m not 
                    trained as a mathematician, but, 
                    when were you born, Veronica?

      As Koontz speaks, Veronica s jaw is clenched so tight, it 
      looks like the muscle might burst through her cheek. It s 
      taking every bit of will power not to break down. She 
      breathes loudly through her nose before opening her mouth.

                                  VERONICA
                    You know, I m no mathematician 
                    either, and here s a word problem I 
                    haven t been able to solve. It 
                    takes, what, ten, twenty minutes to 
                    beg for a man s life. What would a 
                    man and a woman do in a cheap motel 
                    room for the other three hours they 
                    spent together? You re right. Jake 
                    Caine must be a sadist.

      Koontz begins to seethe. He looks like he might explode, but 
      Veronica finishes what she had to say.

                                  VERONICA (CONT D)
                    Lilly Caine was a friend of mine. I 
                    hope you suffer as much as she did.

      Veronica slams the phone down on its hook, turns and doesn t 
      look back as she exits the visitors  room.

      INT. VERONICA S CAR - MOVING - DAY

      Veronica drives home from the prison, cruising along the 
      P.C.H., weeping openly. Koontz has gotten to her. Her world 
      has been turned upside down, and she can t yet process 
      everything that s been thrown at her.

      EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

      Veronica s car pulls into the parking lot.

      INT. VERONICA S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Veronica puts the car in park and shuts off the engine. She 
      wipes her eyes, steels herself. She gazes out at the park 
      grounds.

      VERONICA S P.O.V. - Wallace flies his radio-controlled plane 
      around the perimeter of the park.                                                                                    53.



      The sight of Wallace flying the plane actually allows 
      Veronica a slight smile. She picks up a PADDED ENVELOPE from 
      the passenger seat and gets out of the car.

      EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

      As Veronica makes her way across the park, Wallace lands the 
      plane at her feet and comes jogging over. Wallace notices 
      Veronica s RED EYES.

                                    WALLACE
                    Are you okay? You don t look so 
                    good.

                                  VERONICA
                    Thanks.

                                    WALLACE
                      Seriously. Is everything cool?

                                  VERONICA
                          (changing topics)
                    I m fine. Got a present for you.

      Wallace looks inside, smiles.

                                    WALLACE
                    Man, the way people talk about 
                    you...
                          (off her look, defensive)
                    I m just saying...it s surprising 
                    you d help me out.

      CAMERA PUSHES IN ON VERONICA s FACE, and we...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. COURTHOUSE/SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - FLASHBACK - DAY

      ...the face of 16-year-old Veronica as she trudges up the 
      sidewalk to the sheriff s department. She is a mess. The TORN 
      STRAP on her WHITE PARTY DRESS, her MATTED HAIR let us know 
      it is the morning she woke up in Monica Rivers pool house.

      INT. PLAYA DEL COSTA SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      Veronica walks up to the counter. The Bride of Frankenstein 
      coifed woman we met earlier sees her, bolts up from her desk 
      and approaches the counter. When she speaks, we understand 
      the fake accent Veronica used earlier.                                                                                    54.



                                  INGA
                    Veronica! Sweetie! Vat happened to 
                    you?

                                  VERONICA
                          (robotic, almost in shock)
                    I need to report a crime.

      INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY S OFFICE - DAY

      The DISTRICT ATTORNEY (40, a white, straight-arrow, get-tough-
      on-crime Republican) sorts through FOLDERS and BURGER KING 
      DETRITUS on his desk. He addresses Cliff McCormack. Despite 
      their very different personas, the two men have an easy 
      rapport. McCormack finishes a bite of burger and speaks.

                                  MCCORMACK
                    Who s next?

                                  DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                    Mejia, Hector. Nguyen, Phuong. 
                    Robbing a convenience store. Third 
                    strikes. How does five years sound?

                                  MCCORMACK
                          (finding his file)
                     Robbing a convenience store?  You 
                    mean a grab and go of a few 40s. 
                    C mon Javere, you can do better.

                                  DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                    Gang kids. We want them off the 
                    streets. We got tape. You don t 
                    want this going to trial.

      McCormack considers. Five years is too long for this crime.

                                  MCCORMACK
                    Let me see the tape.

      The district attorney shrugs. No sweat. He pulls a TAPE off a 
      shelf, sticks it in his VCR and hits play.

      INT. COURTHOUSE/SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - FLASHBACK - DAY

      We return to Veronica in her torn party dress. She s been 
      waiting a long time. Inga looks up, gives Veronica a 
      sympathetic look.

                                  INGA
                    I m sure da sheriff will be vit you 
                    any minute. Eets been very busy 
                    today.                                                                                    55.



      VERONICA S P.O.V. - she can see down a long hallway. Don Lamb 
      is at the end of it, joking with deputy s, eating a BAGEL.

      INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY S OFFICE - DAY

      ANGLE ON the identical wide-eyed stares of the district 
      attorney and Cliff McCormack. Whatever they ve just watched 
      on tape has dumbfounded them.

                                  MCCORMACK
                    Can we see that again?

      INT. COURTHOUSE/SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - FLASHBACK - DAY

      Don Lamb finally takes a few steps out into a hallway and 
      motions for Veronica to come back.

                                    SHERIFF LAMB
                    Mars....

      INT. COURTHOUSE/SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - FLASHBACK - DAY

      TIGHT on Lamb s maddening, inappropriate smile.

                                    SHERIFF LAMB
                    So let me get this straight... You 
                    say you were raped, but you don t 
                    remember anything. You re not 
                    bruised. No one was with you when 
                    you woke up.

      Angle on a humiliated Veronica sitting across from Lamb.

                                    SHERIFF LAMB (CONT'D)
                    Hell, that just sounds like my kind 
                    of party. Anyone in particular you 
                    want arrested, or should I just 
                    pick out the sons of all the most 
                    important families in this town? 
                    Would that make your family happy? 
                    Isn t that what you want? Well, I 
                    won t do it. I don t play that 
                    game.

      Veronica doesn t make a sound, but a single tear runs down 
      her cheek. Lamb notices.

                                    SHERIFF LAMB (CONT D)
                    Oh, well, look at this. She cries. 
                    Tell you what, Veronica Mars. Why 
                    don t you grow up. Get some balls.                                                                                    56.



      Angle on Veronica. We can almost see her hardening. Lamb has 
      pissed off the wrong person.

      EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

      We return to Veronica s present-day conversation with 
      Wallace.

                                  VERONICA
                    I had my own reasons for helping 
                    you out. Trust me.

                                    WALLACE
                    Oh, no. Don t think you re getting 
                    away with that. That act might play 
                    with the masses. But underneath 
                    that angry young woman shell, I 
                    know there s a slightly-less-angry 
                    young woman wanting to bake me 
                      something. You re a marshmallow, 
                    Veronica Mars. A cupcake. You re 
                    this close to joining  Up With 
                    People. 

      As is becoming habit, Veronica ends up smiling around Wallace 
      despite her best intentions.

      INT. SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT, BULLPEN - DAY

      Don Lamb, now sporting grayer, shorter hair, stands in the 
      exact place Veronica saw him more than a year ago. He s 
      eating another bagel, gabbing with his staff when the 
      district attorney appears.

                                  DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                    Don, you should come see this.

      INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY S OFFICE - DAY

      The district attorney leads Don Lamb into his office. Lamb 
      notices Cliff McCormack wearing a slight smirk. The two men 
      don t speak as they don t care much for each other. The D.A. 
      picks up a remote from his desk as he speaks.

                                  DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                    This is supposed to be the Mejia, 
                    Nguyen convenience store tape.

      ANGLE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN where handheld digital video 
      pans off of the SEVENTH VEIL sign down to a slightly fuzzy, 
      dark shot of a UNIFORMED MAN leading a LOVELY, YOUNG LADY 
      into the front seat of his squad car.                                                                                     57.


      The two remain seated in the car for a moment, then the 
      woman s head disappears into the officer s lap.

      ANGLE ON Don Lamb beginning to boil with rage.

                                  DISTRICT ATTORNEY (CONT D)
                          (intentionally stating the 
                            obvious)
                    I m not sure this gives us quite 
                    enough for a conviction. At least 
                    not to convict Mejia.

                                  MCCORMACK
                    Is this a bad time to ask for a 
                    dismissal in the Brandy Diamonds 
                    case?

      EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

      Veronica flies Wallace s plane. She is staring up in the air.

                                  VERONICA
                    Okay, how do I make it loop-the-
                    loop?

      But Wallace isn t staring up at the sky. The sound of LIMP 
      BIZKET from a distant car stereo has captured his attention.

                                    WALLACE
                    Uh, Veronica.

                                  VERONICA
                    Yeah?

                                    WALLACE
                    Your car.

      Veronica turns her attention from the sky to the parking lot.

      VERONICA s P.O.V. - Logan and the same buddies we saw with 
      him earlier have used someone s EXCURSION to block in 
      Veronica s car. The boys are lounging on Veronica s car.

      Veronica hands Wallace the radio controller and heads toward 
      the 09ers. Wallace begins to frantically land the plane. In 
      the b.g. of the shot, we see him complete the task, grab his 
      BACKPACK, then jog to catch up with Veronica.

      Veronica notices that Logan has a TIRE IRON in his hand.

                                  LOGAN
                    Veronica Mars. You know what your 
                    little joke cost me?                                                                                    58.



                                  VERONICA
                    Well, I m pretty sure you won t be 
                    getting your cock bong back.

      Logan leans up and uses the tire iron to smash out Veronica s 
      headlight. Veronica doesn t flinch, doesn t react. 

                                  LOGAN
                    Wrong answer. Want to guess again?

                                  VERONICA
                    Let s see. It ll cost you...? Hours 
                    of sexual gratification?

      Logan shakes his head, then furiously smashes out Veronica s 
      other light.

                                  LOGAN
                    No. Wrong again.

      Angle on Wallace, again staring in disbelief as Veronica 
      refuses to be intimidated. Then, he notices something else 
      beyond the 09ers, and he begins to smile.

                                  LOGAN (CONT D)
                    My car. My dad took away my car for 
                    a month.

                                  VERONICA
                          (feigning absurd concern)
                    Oh, my god, Logan. Wow. Dude. Had I 
                    known. Are you all right?

      One of the random 09ers, let s call him STEVE, notices the 
      same thing Wallace has noticed. He attempts to get Logan s 
      attention as well.

                                  STEVE
                    Uh, Logan...

      But Logan is too wrapped up in his conversation with Veronica 
      to stop. He digs the blade of the tire iron into the paint of 
      Veronica s hood and carves a  C  then a  U  in her hood until 
      the music stops suddenly.

      Everyone turns around suddenly to discover the entire P.C.H. 
      Bike Club -- including HECTOR and PHUONG -- surrounding the 
      group. Weevil is already off his chopper. He wades 
      confidently into the fray. He glances down at Logan s 
      handiwork.

                                  WEEVIL
                    Yeah, man, I think she s cute, too.                                                                                    59.



      Weevil stands for a pregnant moment, nose-to-nose with Logan. 
      Logan doesn t back down or look away, but he doesn t resist 
      when Weevil takes the tire iron from his hand.

      Jesus, who has boarded the EXCURSION to turn off the music, 
      leans out of the driver s door and cuts through the tension 
      by holding up a CD.

                                  JESUS
                    Hey, is this O-Town any good? My 
                    little sister likes it, but she 
                    likes ponies and juice boxes.

      None of the 09ers respond. As Weevil takes the tire iron and 
      makes his way over to the Excursion, Wallace leans close to 
      Veronica, whispers.

                                    WALLACE
                      I suddenly feel like I m in a scene 
                    from The Outsiders.

                                  VERONICA
                    Be cool, Soda Pop.

                                    WALLACE
                    Weevil thinks you re cute.

                                  VERONICA
                    I heard.

      Steve realizes what s about to happen; he starts to freak.

                                  STEVE
                    Uh, that s not Logan s car. That s 
                    my mom s.

      Weevil smirks just before he swings the tire iron and takes 
      out both headlights in the Excursion.

                                  WEEVIL
                    Just tell your mom you and your 
                    four friends were out picking on a 
                    girl when a bunch of bikers stopped 
                    and scared you away. I ll bet she 
                      understands.
                          (then to all of them)
                    You can go now. Get out of here.

      Logan gives Veronica a look of contempt before starting to 
      head to the car. Weevil notices.

                                  WEEVIL (CONT D)
                    Except you. You apologize.                                                                                    60.



                                  LOGAN
                    Fuck you.

      Wrong answer. Weevil levels Logan with a right hook. Logan 
      struggles to stand.

                                  WEEVIL
                    I said to say you re sorry.

      Logan makes it all the way up, looks right into Weevil s eye.

                                  LOGAN
                    And I said,  Fuck y...

      Weevil drops Logan again. Weevil looks over at his boys gives 
      them a smile and shrug that betrays a little bit of 
      admiration for Logan. Logan, gushing blood from his nose, 
      begins to pick himself up again.

                                  WEEVIL
                    Here we go again. Ready to tell 
                    Miss Mars how sorry you...

                                  VERONICA
                    Let him go. I don t want his 
                    apology.

                                  WEEVIL
                    You sure? I could do this for a 
                    while.

      Veronica nods. Logan makes it to his feet, meets both 
      Veronica s and Weevil s gazes straight on before climbing 
      into the shotgun seat of the Excursion. The 09ers peel out of 
      the lot, leaving Veronica and Wallace with the bikers.

                                  WEEVIL (CONT D)
                    They came in this afternoon and 
                    just let Phuong and Hector go. No 
                      explanation. Just said charges had 
                    been dropped.

                                  VERONICA
                    That s fortunate.

      Weevil realizes he ll get no more info. He nods at her car.

                                  WEEVIL
                    My uncle has a body shop out on the 
                    highway. You come in, and I ll make 
                    sure your body gets the full 
                    service treatment.                                                                                    61.



                                  VERONICA 
                    Okay, now you apologize.

                                  WEEVIL
                          (laughs, but...)
                    Fine. Was that too dirty? In the 
                    future...

                                  VERONICA
                    Not to me, Gaywad. To Wallace.

                                  WEEVIL
                          (you gotta be kidding)
                    Shit.

                                  VERONICA
                          (genuinely angry)
                    You duct taped him to a flag pole! 
                    You do that to me, and you won t 
                    see next week.

                                  WEEVIL
                    I have no doubt.

      Weevil doesn t apologize, doesn t even look at Wallace.

                                  VERONICA
                    Fine. Wallace has the only copy of 
                    the Sac-N-Pac video tape. Wallace, 
                    let s go decide what to do with it.

      Veronica gets in her car. Wallace moves toward the passenger 
      door, but Weevil stops him and musters some sincerity.

                                  WEEVIL
                    Hold on. Look, man. Sorry about 
                    taping you to the flag pole.

                                    WALLACE
                    All right.

                                  WEEVIL
                    Can I get that tape from you, now?

                                    WALLACE
                    No.

      Wallace gets in the car. He s got the P.C.H. Bike Club right 
      where he wants them. Veronica smiles, starts the car, and 
      pulls out of the lot. No one makes a move to stop her.

      Off Weevil watching Veronica disappearing from view.                                                                                    62.

                    It s Abel Koontz s fault that I ve

      Light floods the 5  X 10  room as the garage door is rolled

                    If Mom dated Jake Caine. They 
                    stayed friends. So what?

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    63.



      Veronica opens a BOX. Inside we find the MEMORABILIA from a 
      mid-70s teenaged girl s adolescence: DRIED CORSAGES, a 
      Peninsula West High CHEERLEADING LETTER, a strip of PHOTO 
      BOOTH PICTURES of two teenaged girls. Most importantly -- 
      Abbie s HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOKS.

      Veronica moves to a CHAIR in the light and flips open the 
      book. She refers to the INDEX, then flips to a page in the 
      book. We see a PRETTY GIRL PAINTING A SPIRIT SIGN. This means 
      nothing. Veronica refers back again, flips to another page.

      The PHOTOS OF STUDENTS IN FORMAL WEAR indicate that we re on 
      the PROM SPREAD. Veronica flips one page forward and 
      discovers a FULL PAGE SHOT OF THE KING AND QUEEN of the prom, 
      slow dancing, lips nearly touching. Two young people very 
      much in love.

      Veronica stares at the caption:  Seniors Abbie Reynolds and 
      Jake Caine, king and queen of the prom, take the night s 
      theme,  Love is Thicker Than Water  to extremes. 

      PUSH IN on Veronica s face. Her confidence is wavering. There 
      may be too much truth in what Abel Koontz told her.

      Veronica flips to the back of the book where everyone has 
      signed her mother s yearbook. Veronica scans through the 
      various epitaphs until she spots the one from Jake Caine.

                    always love you. Some day we ll be 
                    together again. Jake. 
                          (then, her cynical world-
                            view winning out)
                    Or maybe Jake and Abbie were 
                    together again. And maybe the 
                    woman s husband found out. And 
                    maybe that blinded him.

      INT. MARS INVESTIGATIONS - DAY

      Veronica kneels in front of her father s SAFE. She is 
      attempting to open it.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.)
                    It s the rare individual who 
                    chooses meaningless numbers as a 
                      combination -- my father taught me 
                    that.
                          (she tries and fails to 
                            open safe, begins dialing 
                            again)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    64.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Nine times out of ten an individual 
                    will select numbers that mean 
                      something. Birthdays. 
                      Anniversaries. Addresses. My dad 
                    told me that five times out of ten, 
                    those little padlocks on suitcases 
                    remain set to zero zero zero.
                          (she tries and fails to 
                            open safe, dials again)
                    My father is smarter than that.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Veronica now searching Keith s desk.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    You wouldn t believe the number of 
                    people who keep the combination 
                    written down on a Post-it, or 
                    tacked to a bulletin board. Or 
                    written on the first page of their 
                      page-a-day calendar.

      Veronica flips to said page. Nothing. Off her disappointment.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Later. The LONG SHADOWS in the office indicate that the sun 
      is beginning to set. Veronica is slouched down on the floor, 
      across from the safe, staring at it. She s had no luck.

      Veronica looks up, notices that a beam of sunlight has just 
      struck the AQUARIUM that rests on top of the safe. In the 
      aquarium, a PLASTIC DIVER stands on the bottom next to a 
      PLASTIC SHIPWRECK. A SOLITARY GOLDFISH swims around the bowl. 
      Veronica has an epiphany. She crawls hurriedly across to the 
      safe and begins dialing in a combination.

                                  VERONICA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I had one more set of numbers I 
                    could try...11, 29, 01. The day 
                    Lilly Caine disappeared. The day 
                    our lives changed for good.
                          (on second thought)
                    Not for good. Forever.

      The safe opens much to Veronica s astonishment. Veronica 
      stares into the safe for a moment before reaching in an 
      extracting a BULGING FOLDER. Veronica sets it on her father s 
      desk and opens it. She begins spreading out its contents. We 
      recognize it quickly as the CASE FILE OF LILLY CAINE. 

      Included in the file is the WADDED UP PHOTO OF ABEL KOONTZ S 
      DAUGHTER at the Camelot with Jake Caine.                                                                                     65.


      Straight out of Veronica s trash can. It s clear that, for 
      Keith Mars, the Lilly Caine case is far from closed.

      Veronica s mind is already blown when she looks back in the 
      safe and discovers something else. She reaches in and pulls 
      out a STACK OF POSTCARDS.

      CLOSE ON THE POSTCARDS as Veronica flips through them. At 
      first CAMERA SHOOTS UP at Veronica and we see that the they 
      have come from all across America: The Grand Canyon, Mount 
      Rushmore, A Mississippi River Gambling Boat, etc. 

      VERONICA s P.O.V. - the postcards are all addressed to 
      Veronica. They are all signed,  Love, Mom.  The snippets of 
      postcards we see are general messages of affection.  Thinking 
      of you.   Miss you.   Saw this play you would ve loved. 

      Veronica has a tear in her eye when she hears the BELL at the 
      bottom of the stairs. As quickly as she can, Veronica returns 
      the file folder and the postcards back to the safe before 
      rushing to the outer office.

      CAMERA LINGERS on a postcard that has fallen off the desk.

      INT. MARS INVESTIGATIONS, OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Veronica lands in her seat just as the door to the office 
      opens. On the other side of the door is the tearful sophomore 
      girl Wallace was talking to in the library.

                                  VERONICA
                    Hello?

                                  SOPHOMORE GIRL
                    You re Veronica Mars, right?

                                  VERONICA
                    Yeah?

      We hear the RING OF THE BELL above the door again.

                                  SOPHOMORE GIRL
                    Your friend said I should talk to 
                    you.

                                  VERONICA
                          (confused)
                    My friend?

                                  SOPHOMORE GIRL
                          (confused by Veronica s 
                            confusion)
                    Wallace.                                                                                    66.



                                  VERONICA 
                            (considering that, does 
                          she have friend?)
                    Yeah. Wallace. Did he say why?

                                  SOPHOMORE GIRL
                    He said you could help.

                                  VERONICA
                    What s the problem?

      The girl considers. This isn t easy for her.

                                  SOPHOMORE GIRL
                    My boyfriend...my ex-boyfriend took 
                    some pictures of me. I need to get 
                    them back.

      Before Veronica can respond, the DOOR TO THE OFFICE OPENS and 
      Keith steps inside. He takes a look at the girl in the office 
      and assumes it s a friend of Veronica s. He smiles at his 
      daughter. He s as cheery as can be.

                                  KEITH
                    Hey, let s close early, get home 
                    for South Park.

      Veronica nods coolly at her father, who furrows his brow, but 
      continues into his office.

      INT. MARS INVESTIGATIONS - CONTINUOUS

      Keith shakes off his daughter s chilly response and plops 
      down in his chair. He takes his computer out of screensaver 
      mode and begins to check e-mail when he looks down and 
      notices the POSTCARD that fell to the floor. He looks 
      suddenly ashen. Keith picks up the postcard, takes a deep 
      breath and walks back out into the outer office.

      INT. MARS INVESTIGATIONS, OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      But the office is empty. Veronica is gone. He hears the 
      distinctive SOUND OF THE BELL on the door.

      Keith moves to Veronica s window. He watches as his daughter 
      says goodbye to the girl she was with, climbs in her car and 
      drives off into the night.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
