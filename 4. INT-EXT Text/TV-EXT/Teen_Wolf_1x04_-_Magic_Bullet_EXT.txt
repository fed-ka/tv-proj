      Dark. Quiet. Empty. Until the sound of a CAR ENGINE RUMBLES 
      in and a PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS appear on the horizon.


      The passenger door of the car SLAMS open. Kate rolls out to a 
      crouched stance, shotgun primed. The move is fluid and fast. 
      Kate is no ordinary young woman-- 

      She s a HUNTER.

      But there s nothing on the roof of the car now. No sign of 
      movement. Kate spins, shotgun aimed.

      She raises the shotgun and FIRES a shot into the sky.

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      Crunching broken glass beneath her shoes, Kate tosses her 
      shotgun inside the trunk of her semi-destroyed car. 

      From a BLACK BAG, she produces a RIFLE WITH A SCOPE and loads 
      it with BULLETS FROM A BLUE STEEL CASE.

      Then, with the weapon slung over her shoulder, she clicks on 
      a MAGLITE. Sweeping the beam over the pavement, she finds--

      DROPS OF BLOOD.

      Kate pulls her phone out and starts thumbing a text.


      WOLF POV - Moving at breakneck speed behind a series of 
      industrial buildings. Hugging corners. Jumping atop a large 
      dumpster. Then up onto...


      The rooftop. Derek, in human form and the source of the POV, 
      kneels down to inspect BLOOD in the loose gravel. Movement 
      catches his eye--

      A DARK SILHOUETTE just ahead. The Alpha pauses to turn its 
      RED EYES toward Derek. But only for a moment. The black shape 
      spins and charges off.

      Derek launches himself up, running after it. Picking up 
      speed, he LEAPS from the edge of the roof across the 
      alleyway, gliding through the air as--

      BANG! GUNFIRE from the alley below sends him CRASHING to the 
      gravel floor and tumbling to a stop.


      Kate peers out from behind the rifle scope, lips curled into 
      a smile. She loves this stuff. 

      HEADLIGHTS appear around the corner. A BLACK SUV pulls up 
      beside her, Argent behind the wheel.

                                  ARGENT

      Kate crosses to the passenger side to join him. 


      The halo of a street light showcases Kate s damaged car. 
      Argent s SUV skids to a stop. He and Kate get out.

                                  KATE
                    I know there are two. And one of 
                    them just attacked me.

      As they head for her car, their VOICES change, words carrying 
      past the road and into the woods...

                                  ARGENT (V.O.)
                    One of them is going to lead us to 
                    the other. He can t do that if he s 
                    dead.

                                  KATE (V.O.)
                    And I can t help kill either of 
                    them if one of them kills me first.

      HIDING BEHIND A TREE and with his back to it, Scott uses his 
      augmented HEARING to listen in.

                                  ARGENT (V.O.)
                    How long will it take?

                    I d give him 48 hours. If that.


      Derek slips down the side of a building to the pavement. 
      Leaning back against the brick, he inspects the gunshot wound 
      on his left arm.

      It isn t healing. 

      But that s not the strangest part. Because it isn t just 
      blood seeping from the wound. Slim tendrils of SMOKE waft out 
      from a bizarrely GLOWING wound. 

      This was no ordinary bullet...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Students rush the parking lot, racing for their cars at the 
      end of the day. Stiles hops into his Jeep. He pulls out, 
      swinging around for the exit when--

      Derek steps right in front of him. Stiles SLAMS on the 
      brakes. All of the cars behind him SQUEAL to a stop as well, 
      a near pile-up in the school lot.

      FROM THE BIKE RACK - Scott peers up having heard the sudden 
      brake stops. And then he sees why.

      Scott skids his bike to a halt, dust flying up. Allison steps 
      out of her car in the driveway looking at him. He gasps for 
      breath, obviously having pedaled like crazy to get there.        TEEN WOLF EP#104 "EPISODE 104" BUFF DRAFT11/17/1015.

                    chance to get to know each other.

      And he smiles that exceptionally unnerving smile as he guides 
      Scott inside and shuts the door.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Scott shuts the door behind him and heads for his bike with a 
      glazed and utterly stunned look on his face. 

      Hearing MUFFLED ARGUING through the closed door, he mounts 
      his bike. Then, as if only now realizing what was on 
      Allison s mind when she was rifling through Kate s bag, the 
      corners of his mouth start to curl upward.

      A moment later, as he s pedaling away, he starts smiling. 
      Grinning.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Allison steps outside, putting her cell phone to her ear.

                                    ALLISON
                    It s me. Thought maybe I d catch 
                    you before you went to sleep.        TEEN WOLF EP#104 "EPISODE 104" BUFF DRAFT11/17/1043.

      She steps away from the house, trying to be quiet.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    I wanted to say sorry again. For 
                    tonight. Call me.

      Allison hangs up. Then notices Kate s car in the driveway. In 
      perfect condition. No sign of any damage whatsoever. Allison 
      is about to turn back when--

      Something crunches under her foot. She looks down and sees a *
      piece of BROKEN GLASS.*

      Glancing to the car, she approaches. At the edge of the *
      driver s side window a PIECE OF GLASS reflects the light. 

      Allison takes her index finger and drags it over the rubber 
      window guard at the edge of the door. Several small 
      crystalline BITS OF GLASS tumble one by one to the pavement 
      of the driveway.

      Kate s car trouble appears to have required more than a jump 
      start. Much more...
