      HANK and BECCA wait at the gate.  Hank enduring the sullen 
      treatment.  Boarding is announced.  Hank rises.  Tugs Becca 
      to her feet.

                                  HANK
                    Off you go, young lady.  Into the 
                    wild blue yonder.

                                  BECCA
                    Great.  Maybe I ll get lucky and my 
                    plane will explode in midair.

                                  HANK
                    Thank you for that lovely image.

                                  BECCA
                    You d be sad.

                                  HANK
                    That I would.

                                  BECCA
                    For sending me against my will.

                                  HANK
                    I don t get it, Becs.  What could 
                    possibly be so awful about visiting 
                    the woman who pushed you through 
                    her magnificent vagina?  In New 
                    York City.  In the fall, no less.  
                    You re gonna step off that plane 
                    into a Woody Allen movie.  I m 
                    pretty jealous right now.

                                  BECCA
                    Chelsea has Lakers tickets.

                                  HANK
                    You hate basketball.

                                  BECCA
                    You re missing the point.  It s a 
                    killer scene.

      Hank sighs, defeated.  He hugs and kisses his daughter 
      goodbye, but it s somewhat akin to handling a wet rag doll.   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 2.



                                  HANK
                    I know you re in there somewhere, 
                    baby girl.  Have a safe trip.

      Not much of a response from Becca.  He watches as she 
      surrenders her ticket and sulks onto the jetway.

                                  HANK
                          (muttering to himself)
                    Come on... look back.  At least 
                    once.  Then I ll know you still 
                    love me.  Please, God, just give me 
                    a sign from on high.

      Finally, just before she rounds a corner and disappears from 
      sight, she looks back.  Well, scowls is more like it.  But 
      it s enough.  Hank waves and grins like an idiot.

                                  HANK
                    That s right!  That s what I m 
                    talking about!

      Hank s happy rain dance takes us all the way to MAIN TITLES.



      Hank comes down an escalator.  Headed for a baggage carousel.  
      His phone out.  Making a call.

                                  HANK
                    Okay, she s up, up and away...

                                  HANK
                    Don t be too excited.  She hasn t 
                    been very pleasant lately.  Kind of 
                    a little shit, actually.

                    Something wicked your way comes.

                    Hank.  He s your best friend.

                                  HANK
                    Was.  I haven t seen the guy in 
                    years.  Calls me out of the blue.  
                    Wants to come visit.  Says he has 
                    something important to tell me.  
                    Kinda weird, no?

                                  KAREN
                    Whatever.  Just have fun.  You ve

                    now.  Retreat into the man cave.  
                    Have yourself a lost weekend.

                                  HANK
                    I can do that.

                                  KAREN
                    I know you can.

                                  HANK
                    Call me when she lands.  Give her a 
                    kiss for me.

                    With pleasure.

      Karen hangs up.  So does Hank.  He looks around...

      Whereupon he is suddenly TACKLED.  And mock butt-fucked, too.

      His assailant is none other than his best buddy from 
      childhood, MIKE ZLOZOWSKI (40s), an Irish-Polack from working-
      class Long Island.  Henceforth known as ZLOZ.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Moody!  You handsome motherfucker.

                    buddy?!   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 4.



      Zloz pulls Hank to his feet.  Tugs him into a mammoth 
      embrace.  Hank gives Zloz a serious once-over.

                                  HANK
                    Jesus, where did that plane come 
                    from?  1987?  You look exactly the 
                    same.  And that smell... 
                      cigarettes, booze and Drakkar 
                    Noir... takes me right back.

                                  ZLOZ
                    What about you?  Ya look like half-
                    a-fag in that smoking jacket, but 
                    you smell pretty much the same -- 
                    like a cock dipped in shit.

      Hank looks at Zloz with a mixture of horror and bemused 
      affection.  

                                  HANK
                    It s good to see you, Zloz.  Been a 
                    long time, my friend.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Yeah, and whose fault is that?  Who 
                    never comes back to the Island?  
                    Fancy book writer Hank-fucking-

                                  HANK
                    What can I say?  They won t let me 
                    back.  I divulged too many small 
                    town secrets, named too many names.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Well, here I am, man.  I finally 
                    made it.  LA, man.  L-fucking-A.

                    So what s going on?  You sounded 
                    pretty mysterious on the phone.

      Hank and Zloz at the bar.  Zloz taking it all in.  He s a

      A beat.  Zloz thinking this is something Hank should know.  
      He leaves it alone.  Waves the BEAUTIFUL BARMAID over with 
      his index finger.

                    Hey, I made you come with one 
                    finger.  Imagine what I could do

      Beautiful Barmaid rolls her eyes, annoyed.  Hank winces, 
        embarrassed.

      She goes.  Hank slaps Zloz upside the head.

      Another round of drinks arrive.  Hank reaches for his wallet.  
      Zloz beats him to the punch.

                    Fuck you.  I got this.

      Zloz throws a twenty down, turns away.  Beautiful Barmaid 
      shakes her head -- not quite enough.  Hank covers the rest.  
      Mouths  Keep it.

                    dizzy.  And clammy.  Do I feel 
                    clammy to you?  Is that how it 
                    starts?

                    Shit, I gotta get going.  Ronnie 
                    and I are registering at the Crate 
                    & Barrel down the street.  We re 
                    sending you guys an invite, you 
                    know.  You better come.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Sure, if I m not in a syphilitic 
                    coma by then.

      She gives him a sweet little kiss and goes, leaving Charlie 
      unsure whether he should weep or vomit. 



      Hank and Zloz wander into the Hollywood party of your 
      cinematic daydreams.  It should feel like we ve stepped into 
      another era.  A sweet spot somewhere between 1979 and 1985.

                                  ZLOZ
                      Fucking-A.  This is some serious 
                    Scarface shit right here.

      Hank quickly finds Charlie and Marcy in the crowd.

                      Runkles... I want you to meet the

                                  ZLOZ
                    Mike Zlozowski.  Nice to meet you 
                    guys.  Thanks for taking good care 
                    of my boy.

      Ad-libbed greetings are exchanged.  Zloz says to Hank:   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 15.



                                  ZLOZ
                    So this is your Ovitz?

                                  HANK
                    If by Ovitz you mean the man who 
                    does absolutely nothing to improve 
                    my professional life and only 
                    serves to amuse me, then yes, this 
                    is my Ovitz.

                          (to Zloz)
                    Let me ask you:  was he always such 
                    a prick?

                                  ZLOZ
                    Always.  It s a disease, really.  I 
                    had to hand him his ass on an 
                    almost daily basis.

      SUE COLLINI greets them, martini in hand...

                                    COLLINI
                      Welcome...

      Hugs and hellos and whatnot.

      A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR cruises up alongside Collini.  A 
      handsome, well-dressed older man.  Somewhat erudite.

                                  WHEELCHAIR GUY
                    This must be Runkle.  I see what 
                    you mean.  Great head for helming.

                                    COLLINI
                    I d like to introduce my husband... 
                    Walter Collini.

      Looks are thrown between Hank and the Runkles.  Hank chuckles 
      and gives Charlie a pat on the back.

                                  HANK
                    Enjoy yourself, Cap n.

      Hank wanders off with Zloz.  Charlie pulls Collini aside.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Whoa, hold on a second here.

                    I had no idea.

                                    COLLINI
                    You never asked. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    I feel very strange about this.

                                    COLLINI
                    Don t you worry, Runkle.  Walter 
                    and I have an open relationship.  
                    As you can see, he has certain 
                      limitations.  But he s a master of 
                    the oral arts.
                          (to Marcy)
                    You should give him a try sometime.

      Whereupon he wags his tongue and does a fancy little 
      wheelchair wheelie for emphasis.  Marcy starts to mutter:

                                  MARCY
                    There s no place like home, there s

      Charlie and Marcy find themselves in a verbal headlock with 
      Sue and Walter Collini.

                                    COLLINI
                    Who wants to go down to the 
                    playroom and make a little movie?  
                    We ve got a camera, a tripod, and a 
                    dirty futon.

                                  MARCY
                    That sounds like a snuff film.

                                  WALTER COLLINI
                    Nonsense.  Runkle, have you ever 
                    seen a stag film?

                    I ve seen my fair share of porn.

                                  WALTER COLLINI
                    Not porn, you simpleton.  A stag 
                    film is different.  Evokes a bygone 
                    era.  A better time for sex.

                    I don t believe I have, Mr. 
                    Collini.

                                  WALTER COLLINI
                    Listen to me.  We have something in

                    Okay, fair enough.  Walter it is.

                                    COLLINI
                    Walter has one of the preeminent

                    this soldier hard.
                          (off their looks)
                    Not down there.  No sirree.  That 
                    thing s about as useful as a piece 
                    of string cheese.  But my tongue.  
                    That s where it s at.  When I get 
                    aroused, all the blood rushes to my 
                    mouth.  It s almost better than a 
                    penis.  It s a heat-seeker.

      He wags his tongue at Marcy, who cowers, grossed-out.

                                    COLLINI
                    He speaks the truth, my man does.  
                    Although I m still a penetration 
                    junkie at heart.  Which is why he s 
                    kind enough to let me shop

                    This one over here rode me so hard 
                    one night she broke my member.  It 
                    ballooned up.  Got all swollen and 
                    purple.  Like an eggplant.  I 
                    freaked out, thought I was never 
                    going to be able to make love 
                    again.  So I threw myself off the 
                    deck.  Broke just about every bone 
                    in my body.  But Sue Collini -- she 
                    stayed with me.  Through thick and 
                    thin.  To Hell and back.  I love 
                    her madly.

      Walter and Sue make out furiously.  Marcy elbows Charlie.  
      They try to sneak away.  No such luck.  Busted.

      Hank is shooting some pool when a flabbergasted Zloz races 
      in, soaking wet, pulling on his clothes.

                    just an oversized clit.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Things were going really well.  Too 
                    well.  We were making out in the 
                    hot tub.  She said she wanted to 
                    tell me something.  I thought she 
                    had a boyfriend or something.  Next 
                    thing I know, she guides my hand 
                    down to her thin, bent dong.

      The Tranny enters, loaded for bear.  Hell-bent on kicking

                    I think he knew.  Deep down.  He 
                    was looking for a little meat.

      His sexuality challenged, Zloz does what comes natural -- he 
      takes a swing.  Pissed, Hank shoves Zloz.  They end up in a 
      retard-clumsy fistfight.  At which point Collini enters.

                    Maybe not tonight, though.  Maybe 
                    we take a break.

                                  MARCY
                    Why?  Why don t you want to fuck 
                    me?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Because this is my boss s house.

                    So what?  Your boss is a stone 
                    freak.  I think she would very much 
                    approve of a quickie happening 
                    right under her very roof.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I m also a little sore.  Chafed,

                                  MARCY
                    Okay, what the fuck is going on?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Nothing.  I guess I m just a little 
                      overwhelmed by the whiplash nature 
                    of our relationship.

                                  MARCY
                    Bullshit.  You fucked someone else, 
                    didn t you?

                      Something s up with you, Runkle.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Daisy came to see me today.

                                  MARCY
                    I knew it!  A woman always knows.  
                    So what, you wanna go back to her 
                    now?  Have some skanky little porno

                    already, Runkle!

                                    CHARLIE
                    No, I told her I want to be with 
                    you.  Only with you.  My one true 
                    love.

                                  MARCY
                    And what d she say, that little 
                    tramp?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Well... actually... and this is 
                      interesting... she said that she 
                    had contracted a few STDs.  Nothing 
                    too crazy, mind you.  Nothing a 
                    bolus of antibiotics won t cure.

                                  MARCY
                    Wow.  I seriously think I m gonna 
                    throw up right now.

                                    CHARLIE
                    That s what I said.  I think.  
                    Maybe I said I was dizzy.  Same 
                      difference, really.

      Marcy really does look like she s going to puke.  She s 
      doubled over, trying to catch her breath.  Charlie tries to 
      comfort her.

      She comes up for air.  Hauls off and PUNCHES HIM in the face.

                                  MARCY
                    I m taking your little fucking girl 
                    car, Charlie.  Don t you dare come 
                    home tonight.



      Absolute chaos.  Lights, music, girls galore... all captured 
      by shaky, hand-held cameras.  Hank is talking to JACKIE at 
      the bar.

                                  HANK
                    Hey, do you know any ladies who are 
                    more or less a sure thing?

                                  JACKIE
                    You re looking at one.

                                  HANK
                    That s sweet.  For my friend over 
                    there.

      Hank nods at a trashed Zloz, who is enjoying the shit out of 
      a lap dance from a BUSTY BLONDE STRIPPER.

                                  ZLOZ
                          (shouts to Hank)
                    Now this is more like it!  You see 
                    the tits on this broad?!

      Jackie frowns at Hank.

                                  HANK
                    He s a really nice guy.  Deep down.

                                  JACKIE
                    This is a strip club, Hank.  Not a 
                      whorehouse.

      Charlie, meanwhile, has a STRIPPER working one leg and a 
      LITTLE PERSON STRIPPER bouncing on the other.  He SHOUTS over 
      the music:

                                    CHARLIE
                    Be careful, ladies!  I think I 
                    might have an STD!

                                  STRIPPER
                    What s that, honey?!

                                    CHARLIE
                    I think I have an STD!

                                  STRIPPER
                    An MP3?!

                                    CHARLIE
                    Never mind...

      And now we re with Zloz, who s in hog heaven.  Although he 
      can t help but ask:

                                  ZLOZ
                    Hey, you don t happen to have a 
                    dick, do ya?
                          (off her look)
                    No offense or anything.

      Busty Blonde Stripper looks at him for a moment, annoyed.

                    None taken.

      She takes his hand and places it firmly on her crotch.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Nope.  No dick down there.  No hair 
                    either.  Sorry I doubted you, 
                      sweetheart.

      Back to business.  She takes her top off.  Big boobs spill 
      out.  Zloz is beside himself.  Finds himself mesmerized.

      A moment.

      Too drunk to stop himself, he dives right in.  Like a hungry 
      baby, he latches onto a nipple and won t let go.

      A WWE-SIZED BOUNCER is there in no time.  Grabs Zloz in a 
      bear hug and heads for the door.

      Hanks sees what s going on and throws himself in between.

                                  HANK
                    What happened?  What d he do?

                    He was sucking her titties.  That s 
                    not cool.

                                  HANK
                    Shit, you got that right.
                          (to Zloz)
                    What were you thinking?

                                  ZLOZ
                    Hank, they were fucking epic.  I 
                    couldn t help myself.  She was like 
                    Mamie Van Doren meets Samantha Fox.  
                    You know what a tit man I am!

      Hank produces some cash, tries to smooth things over.

                                  HANK
                          (to bouncer)
                    Look, can we forget about this?  
                    You can take the boy out of Long

                    Hey, that s fucking condescending, 
                    you prick.

      Zloz sees red, takes a swing.  The bouncer swings back.  
      Something akin to a western bar fight breaks out.  The whole 
      place goes shithouse.  Zloz looks at Hank with a crazy grin.

                                  ZLOZ
                    You with me, compadre?

      Which should resemble David Lee Roth s hotel room circa 1984.  
      It looks like a fucking bomb went off.  And much fun was had.  

      Next to Hank, tangled up in the sheets, SLEEPING BEAUTY.  All 
      blonde hair and dangerous curves.  We can t see her face.

      Hank gets out of bed.  Too fast.  Puts his hands out to stop 
      the spinning.  Courtesy of the night before, natch.

      He stumbles around the room, looking for something he can t 
      quite find.  Then -- a light bulb moment.  He lurches into:


      THE BATHROOM1515

      Where the sudsy remains of a bubble bath are still in the 
      tub.  He shoves a hand into the froth, comes up with various 
      and sundry articles of clothing.

      Tops, bottoms, lacy what-have-you s.  Finally producing his 
      sunglasses.

      He shakes off the suds.  Slides them on.  Looks in the 
      mirror.  Improvs some kung fu moves.  And then it s...


      INTO THE DINING ROOM1616

      It s a fucking mess in here, too.  Bottles of booze 
      everywhere.  A mushroom cloud of cigarette smoke hanging in 
      the air.

      Hank crosses paths with last night s Little Person Stripper, 
      who is exiting Becca s bedroom.  She gives him a nod and a 
      wink and heads for the kitchen.

      Hank watches as she opens the fridge and guzzles some OJ out 
      of the carton.  He turns, walks into...


      BECCA S BEDROOM1717

      Where another stripper is passed out in Becca s bed.

      A GNARLY PAIR OF MALE FEET poke out from under the covers 
      next to her head.

      Hank peeks under the covers down by the girl s feet.  Finds 
      an unconscious Charlie under there.  Sporting a nasty shiner.

      Hank puts the covers back over Charlie s face.  Leaves the 
      room...   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 28.



      IN THE LIVING ROOM1818

      Zloz is passed out on the floor.

      Hank sighs, looks at his old friend with equal measures 
      compassion and disgust.  He gets an idea.  Goes...


      INTO HIS BEDROOM1919

      Where he shakes Sleeping Beauty.  Turns out it s Jackie.  She 
      wakes up yawning.  All sleepy and cute.  Smiles at Hank.

                                  JACKIE
                    Morning, teach.  Our first 
                      sleepover.

                                  HANK
                    Yeah, wish I remembered a little 
                    more of it.

                                  JACKIE
                    Did we take a bubble bath?

                                  HANK
                    There is evidence to support that 
                    theory, yes.
                          (then)
                    Can you do me big favor?



      We re CLOSE ON ZLOZ as he wakes up.

      Trying to remember where he is and how the fuck he got there.  
      He senses a body curled up next to him on the floor.  He 
      looks:

      It s Jackie.  Sound asleep.  He can t believe his good 
      fortune.  He peeks under the blanket.  Yep, she s naked.  
      Even better.  She wakes up.  All sleepy and cute.  Smiles.

                    Good times...

      Hank comes out of the bedroom.  Yawning.  As if he just woke 
      up.  Zloz leaps to feet.  Runs into Hank s arms.  Big hug.  
      Hank pats his naked friend on the back.  Looks at Jackie.
