A WOMB.
DAY.
A fiber optic camera observes a five-month-old MALE FETUS as he
gently floats, weightless, suspended in the amniotic fluid of
his mother's womb.
We focus on the unborn's hand, already a
tiny, exquisite work of art, moving towards his newly formed
lips.
He sucks his thumb.
HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM.
DAY.
A seconds old BABY BOY - umbilical cord still attached,
smeared with blood and protective skin grease - is held up
by an anonymous pair of latex gloves to the camera.
Shocked by
the unaccustomed light and cool of the delivery room, the
newborn fights for his first, arduous breath.
Following almost
immediately, a cry.
From another angle we see the crying infant on a television
screen, the individual lines of the screen clearly visible.
MATCH DISSOLVE TO
CAR - UTOPIA, QUEENS.
MORNING.
The face of the baby thirty-four years later, still crying.
TRUMAN BURBANK, thinning hair, a body going soft around the
edges, appearing older than his thirty-four years sits at the
wheel of his eight-year-old Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.
He
cries without shame, making no attempt to wipe away the tears.
Pausing at an intersection in a quiet, working-class suburban
street, a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and
lands with a deafening crash on the roadway, several yards in
front of his idling car.
Truman exits the Oldsmobile to investigate.
Amidst a sea of
shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism.
He looks around him but the street is deserted.
He checks that
all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for, even though
the fallen fixture is far larger.
He looks up into the sky but
there is no plane in sight.
With some effort, Truman picks up
what's left of the crumpled light, loads it into the trunk of
his car and drives away.
CAR - TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.
MORNING.
TRUMAN sits behind the wheel of his car, unscrews the cap of
a miniature bottle of Jack Daniels and empties the contents into
his Styrofoam cup of coffee.
Stirring it in with his finger, he
burns himself.
TRUMAN
Shit!
As Truman drinks, he becomes aware of the delighted squeals of
children coming from the gymnasium of Utopia Elementary School,
adjacent to the parking lot.
The sound of the children triggers
a memory in his head.
SCHOOLROOM.
DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.
Once again, the flashback appears to be playing on a television
screen.
The sandy-haired SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits in the middle row of
a Catholic Elementary School classroom surrounded by thirty-or-
so other well-scrubbed, uniformed YOUNGSTERS.
DOUGLAS, the boy
next to Truman is on his feet under the scrutiny of a sixty-
year-old NUN with a face as wrinkled as her habit is starched.
DOUGLAS
I wanna be a chiropractor like my dad.
SISTER
(impressed)
Tell the class what a chiropractor does,
Douglas.
DOUGLAS
He helps people by fixing their backs,
Sister Olivia.
SISTER
That's right, Douglas.
(holding her back, hamming it up)
Perhaps I'll be your first patient.
The CLASS titters.
Douglas sits down, pleased with himself,
throwing a smirk to Truman.
SISTER
What about you, Truman?
Truman rises to his feet.
TRUMAN
I want to be an explorer
(with reverence)
...like Magellan.
The Sister's face falls.
SISTER
No one's going to pay you to do that,
Truman.
(with scarcely disguised glee)
Besides, you're too late.
There's
nothing left to explore.
The class roars with laughter and Truman takes his seat.
INSURANCE COMPANY - TWELFTH FLOOR.
DAY.
In a cramped, cluttered, windowless cubicle, TRUMAN talks on
the telephone.
TRUMAN
(into receiver)
...okay, okay, let's call it what it is...
I'm not gonna lie to you...life insurance
is death insurance...you just gotta ask
yourself two questions...one, in the event
of your death, will anyone experience
financial loss?...and two, do you care?
A CLERK drops a large reference book on Truman's desk.
He
checks the spine - "MORTALITY STATISTICS, 1986 to Present".
TRUMAN
(into receiver)
Hold on will ya?
(to Clerk, putting receiver
to chest, referring to the book)
This's no good.
Lumps all drownings
together.
I need drownings broken down
by category.
The Clerk shrugs, returns the book to his trolley and continues
his rounds.
TRUMAN
(returning to his call)
...just think about what I've been
saying and lemme...hello?...
The person on the other end has hung up.
With an apathetic
shrug, Truman replaces the receiver.
He looks over his shoulder
and places another call.
TRUMAN
(lowering his voice)
Can you connect me with directory
inquiries in Sydney, Australia?
(a long delay makes Truman
even more uncomfortable)
...er, yes.
Do you have a listing
for a Lauren Powers...
(pause)
...nothing listed?...what about a Sylvia
Powers...nothing?
Thanks...
Truman replaces the receiver, disappointed.
LOCAL ITALIAN DELI.
LUNCHTIME.
TRUMAN stands in line with a crush of other WHITE COLLAR
WORKERS.
As he reaches the counter, the store owner, TYRONE,
has anticipated his order and ahs already begun preparing a
meatball and mozzarella sandwich on Italian roll.
Truman gazes
at the sandwich skillfully under construction, pained by his own
predictability.
TYRONE
(nauseatngly cheerful)
How's it goin', Truman?
TRUMAN
(deadpan)
Not bad.
I just won the State Lottery.
TYRONE
(not listening to Truman's
reply, as Truman anticipated)
Good.
Good.
TRUMAN
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
TYRONE
(not missing a beat)
I'd ask for identification.
Truman forces a half-smile.
We focus on another MALE OFFICE WORKER in line at the cash
register, watching Truman out of the corner of his eye.
About
to depart with his sandwich, the man receives a guarded rebuke
from the FEMALE CASHIER.
FEMALE CASHIER
(a whisper to prevent Truman overhearing)
He's right there.
You're supposed to pay
when he's here.
MALE CUSTOMER
(nonchalant shrug as he departs)
He never notices.
We re-focus our attention on Truman who is taking the wrapped
sandwich from Tyrone.
TYRONE
Hold on, Truman.
I got somethin' to show ya.
Tyrone holds up a front page of the New York Post that
features a photograph of a scaled-down replica of Columbus'
Santa Maria, moored in front of the Manhattan skyline.
Truman's
eyes widen at the photograph.
TYRONE
(referring to the photo)
The flagship of Christoforo...our Genoese
navigator, huh?
I know you love this like me.
TRUMAN
(averting his eyes with difficulty)
Not me.
You got the wrong man.
Tyrone tries not to let his disappointment show as Truman pays
the Cashier and exits.
TYRONE
See ya tomorrow, Truman.
A DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.
DAY.
Close up on an old man's face.
CHRISTOF.
Hair pure white,
late-sixties, a vitality in his eyes that belies his years.
He stands beside a floor-to-ceiling window in a dimly-lit room.
Outside the window, a single palm tree swaying against a deep
blue Californian sky.
A news anchor-style earpiece disappears
down the neck of the unconventionally-cut suit he wears.
Suspended from the ceiling above his head is a television
monitor upon which a surveillance picture of Truman, engrossed
in his book, silently plays.
CHLOE, twenty-something, androgenous-looking, similarly-suited,
joins Christof at the window.
CHRISTOF
(never taking his eyes
from the monitor)
You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the
road?
They're pulling out a body.
You know
you shouldn't look, but you do.
A CONFERENCE ROOM SOMEWHERE.
DAY.
A group of a dozen MEN and WOMEN of varying ages sit around
a circular conference table in a sterile, windowless meeting
room.
All stare at a single telephone placed in the center of
the table, anticipating a call.
On cue, the phone rings and one
of the men, after waiting for the second ring, picks up.
MAN
Hello?...I'm sorry, I got more than enough
insurance.
He hangs up.
After a moment the phone rings again.
INSURANCE COMPANY.
DAY.
TRUMAN sits at his desk, making a cold call.
TRUMAN
(into receiver)
...this isn't about insurance, this is
about the great variable - when will
death occur?
Could be a week, a month,
a year.
Could happen today...A sunbather,
minding his own business, gets stabbed in
the heart by the tip of a runaway beach
umbrella...No way you can guard against
that kinda thing, no way at all...
The prospect on the other end, unimpressed with his pitch, hangs
up.
Truman's supervisor, LAWRENCE, younger than Truman by
several years, sharper suit, sharper haircut, appears around the
corner of the cubicle.
LAWRENCE
(handing Truman some documentation)
Hey, Burbank, I got a bridge-buyer in
Stapleton I need you to cloes by four.
Truman turns pale.
TRUMAN
Stapleton on Staten Island?
LAWRENCE
(sarcastic)
You know another one?
TRUMAN
I can't do it.
LAWRENCE
(insistent)
A half hour across the bay.
Sea air.
Do
you good.
TRUMAN
No, I...
(searching for a plausible excuse)
...I got an appointment uptown.
LAWRENCE
This is a sure thing.
(conspiratorial)
They're upping our quota.
You need this.
Lawrence exits the cubicle.
Truman's head drops.
He picks up
the framed picture of his wife from his desk.
MERYL, early
thirties, a petite woman easy to mistake for frail.
He deposits
the photo in his briefcase and departs.
MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.
DAY.
TRUMAN, briefcase in hand, ashen-faced, stands in line for the
Staten Island ferry.
As the TOURISTS and COMMUTERS impatiently brush past him onto
the boat, Truman remains frozen to the spot, mesmerized by the
scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock, triggering
a flashback in his head.
MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.
DAY.
TRUMAN turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide
of PASSENGERS boarding the ferry, emerging back on the street
into the bright sunlight, gasping for air.
Gathering himself, he makes for the entrance of Whitehall Street
subway station.
Two COMMUTERS surrepticiously observe Truman as
he departs.
COMMUTER 1
(commenting out of Truman's earshot)
I can't believe he's taking the long way.
COMMUTER 2
He'll never make it.
SUBWAY TRAIN.
DAY.
TRUMAN stands in a packed subway car, anxiously glancing at his
watch, wiping his perspiring hairline with a hankerchief.
DAY.
A taxi crosses the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge towards Staten
Island.
TRUMAN keeps his eyes shut tight all the way across.
refusing to look down at the entrance to New York harbor.
CONDOMINIUM.
DAY.
A middle-aged CONCIERGE behind a reception desk, is having his
hair brushed by a YOUNGER MAN in his mid-thirties.
Anticipating
Truman's arrival, the hairdresser fusses one more time and
swiftly departs through a rear door.
TRUMAN enters the lobby
and approaches the CONCIERGE, trying to keep his arms tightly at
his sides to hide the perspiration.
TRUMAN
I'm here to see a Mr Hamilton.
CONCIERGE
You from the insurance company?
You missed him.
TRUMAN
When will he be back?
CONCIERGE
Vacation.
Two months.
He waited as long as
he could.
You was supposed to be here by four.
A clock on the wall reads 4.l2pm.
SUBWAY.
AFTERNOON.
TRUMAN sits by himself in the rattling subway car, defeated.
The only other occupants in the train, a TALL WOMAN, mid-
thirties, reading a pulp novel and two MALE YOUTHS, late-teens,
sitting opposite the woman, slouching, ogling her.
YOUTH 1
(to woman)
You wanna read to me?
His companion smirks.
YOUTH 1
(more insistent)
You wannna read to me?
The woman looks up, unaware of the boys' presence until now.
She quickly avoids eye contact and returns to the book.
The
other boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp.
YOUTH 2
(menacing)
My friend asked you a question.
The woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and
holds it to her.
She looks around the train for assistance,
briefly catching Truman's eye.
The youths also look in
Truman's direction, staring him down, daring him to interfere.
Truman quickly averts his gaze.
WOMAN
(reaching for the book)
Please...
The boy returns the book to the woman, but before doing so rips
out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt
pocket.
YOUTH 2
Now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends.
The train pulls into a deserted station.
Feeling vulnerable,
the woman jumps up from her seat and exits.
The youths, sensing
a chase, also exit.
Scanning the empty platform, the woman
realizes she has made a serious error.
Truman watches through
the train's open door as the boys corner the frightened woman
but still he remains in his seat.
YOUTH 1
We're gonna tell you how it ends, baby.
One of the youths produces a knife from his pocket and waves it
in the woman's face.
YOUTH 2
Don't you wanna know how it ends?
The boys pin the woman to the station wall with the weight of
their bodies.
The woman looks again in Truman's direction.
Again she makes eye contact, eyes pleading.
WOMAN
(screams)
Help!!
Please, help!!
The woman's second scream is muffled as the train door closes.
Truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door.
There
is still time to act.
He stands up and half-reaches for the
handle but moves no further.
The train abruptly pulls away, leaving Truman time to see one of
the youths covering the woman's mouth while the other reaches
under her skirt before the train enters the tunnel.
Truman bows
his head in shame as the train rattles on.
SUBWAY STATION.
DAY.
The train safely out of sight, the YOUTHS promptly release the
WOMAN.
She calmly hitches down her skirt, no longer afraid.
The young men, no longer angry, help fix her hair and retrieve
her shoulder bag.
WOMAN
Thanks.
The threesome walk along the platform together, as if lifelong
friends.
WOMAN
(pondering the incident)
He did nothing.
YOUTH 1
(shrugs, suddenly more couth)
Physical violence paralyzes him.
Always
has.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.
DAY.
MERYL is applying ointment to her wrists as TRUMAN enters.
TRUMAN
(referring to her hands)
Do they hurt?
MERYL
I was afraid I'd seize up during cross.
One of the keys kept sticking.
Truman picks up Meryl's newspaper and skims idly through it.
He
notes an article headlined, "SLAYING TRIAL ENTERS SIXTH WEEK".
TRUMAN
(referring to the article)
Is he gonna take the stand?
MERYL
(dispassionate, matter-of-fact)
No point.
Two eye witnesses saw him
near the dumpster where they found the legs.
She flexes her arthritic wrists.
MERYL
You gonna eat before you leave?
TRUMAN
I'll get something out.
MERYL
(sensing something odd
in his demeanor)
Did something happen today?
Truman turns to her too sharply, his guilt showing.
TRUMAN
(composing himself)
What could happen?
DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.
The lines of a television screen signal another of Truman's
flashbacks.
A small group of MOURNERS in black, several openly
weeping, stand on the end of a small jetty, including the SEVEN-
YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, dry-eyed in an ill-fitting suit, his weeping
MOTHER, older sister, RAQUEL, and a PRIEST at the head of the
gathering.
The priest nods to Truman who holds an ornate wreath, heavy and
cumbersome in his tiny hands.
He heaves it off the dock.
MATCH DISSOLVE TO
DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.
NIGHT.
CHRISTOF's dispassionate face is reflected in the screen of a
television monitor that displays the distraught TRUMAN at the
water's edge.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE.
NIGHT.
At the Formica kitchen table, TRUMAN makes calculations in a
school notebook, a bottle of beer close at hand.
MERYL appears
in her robe, a glimpse of black negligee beneath, restless.
She
throws her arms around Truman's neck.
MERYL
(suggestive)
What are you doing?
Come to bed.
TRUMAN
(ignoring the suggestion)
I figure we could scrape together eight
thousand.
MERYL
(suddenly exasperated)
Oh.
God, everytime you and Marlon--
TRUMAN
--We could bum around the world for a year
on that.
MERYL
And then what, Truman?
We'd be back to
where we were five years ago.
You're talking
like a teenager.
TRUMAN
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
Getting to his feet.
Truman holds Meryl by the arms, talking
excitedly to her the way we imagine he did when they were
courting.
TRUMAN
Meryl, it'd be an adventure.
MERYL
We said we'd try for a baby.
Isn't that
enough of an adventure?
TRUMAN
That can wait.
I want to get away.
See
some of the world.
Explore.
Meryl gives a derisive laugh.
MERYL
You want to be an explorer?
You mean like
all the other great explorers from Queens?
You don't even have a passport, Truman.
I
bet you don't even know how to get one.
The words sting.
Truman turns away.
Seeing the pain she's caused, she changes tack.
MERYL
This'll pass.
Everybody thinks like this
now and then.
(making one more attempt
at seduction)
Come to bed.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.
NIGHT.
TRUMAN stands in the darkened bedroom in his Hanes underwear
looking down at his bed.
MERYL has fallen asleep waiting for
him, snoring lightly.
Truman rests his hand tentatively on the
bed.
The surface rocks.
A waterbed.
The motion triggers a
flashback in his head.
A LIVING ROOM SOMEWHERE.
NIGHT.
Two OLD WOMEN, seventies, sit beside wach other on a sofa
against a bare wall, looking directly into camera as they
talk.
Nothing else of the room is seen.
OLD WOMAN 1
(playing amateur psychiatrist)
It left him with more than his obvious fear
of the water.
It's as if he felt his father
had gone beyond his limitations and he vowed
never to repeat the mistake.
He was never
the same curious little boy again.
OLD WOMAN 2
We're all born with a pound of cocaine
up our nose.
By the time we're eleven
it runs out.
OLD WOMAN 1
Half the people I knew named their
babies after him.
TRUMAN'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT, QUEENS.
DAY.
TRUMAN stands in the corridor of his mother's cramped, fussy.
doilyed apartment with his older sister, RAQUEL, late forties,
prematurely grey.
Through a doorway, the figure of his MOTHER
is visible asleep in bed, despite the early hour.
Truman and
Raquel speak in hushed tones to avoid waking her.
RAQUEL
Don't you dare go in. Truman.
I just
got her off to sleep.
TRUMAN
It was Dad. I swear.
Raquel fixes Truman with a contemptuous stare.
RAQUEL
Well, the next time he shows up. bring
him over.
Until then, I'm not saying a
word about this to Mom and neither are you.
TRUMAN
If it wasn't him, it was his twin.
Can you
think of a reason he'd want to hide from us?
RACQUEL
I know a reason he'd want to hide from you.
Look at how you treat us.
You live ten minutes
away, we hardly see you from year to year and
then you turn up with this story so insane you
don't even believe it yourself.
Haven't you
hurt her enough, Truman?
She already blames you.
TRUMAN
(incredulous)
I was seven years old!
RAQUEL
But you're here and he's not.
Has it really taken you
this long to invent a story to ease your conscience?
TRUMAN
I'm telling you he's alive!
RAQUEL
(snapping back bitterly)
And I'm telling you he's fish food!
Truman meets her unforgiving eyes.
Without another word, he
walks out of the apartment.
Truman safely departed, the figure in the bed, rolls out.
CHRISTOF, fully clothed, relishing the danger of being so close
to Truman without being detected.
Raquel's demeanor immediately
changes, all trace of bitterness gone from her face, she appears
younger, posture more upright, almost a different person.
Christof hugs Raquel.
CHRISTOF
You did well.
DRESSING ROOM SOMEWHERE.
NIGHT.
A cavernous dressing room contains a long row of identical
mirrored make-up tables.
At the only occupied table, Truman's
contrite father, KIRK, is having what's left of his homeless
disguise cleaned from his face by a MAKE-UP ARTIST under the
watchful eye of two DARK-SUITED BODYGUARDS.
From a mezzanine floor out of Kirk's vision, CHRISTOF and CHLOE
also take in the proceedings.
Behind their heads, a monitor
shows a surveillance picture of an agitated TRUMAN sitting in
his car, trapped in rush-hour traffic.
CHLOE
We've tightened security.
Christof nods indifferently, knowing the damage is already done.
CHLOE
(referring to Kirk)
Why would he do this to us?
CHRISTOF
Old age.
Sentiment.
You play someone's
father all those years, you are someone's
father...He sees the way Truman is.
He
feels responsible.
Christof turns and enters an office adjacent to the balcony,
containing a state-of-the-art monitor and VCR.
Chloe follows.
Christof plays the cued recording without comment.
We focus on
the screen.
TRUMAN'S GARAGE.
DUSK.
A cluttered garage, dimly lit by a single work lamp.
TRUMAN
looks over his shoulder before turning his attention to a dusty
trunk under a canvas sheet.
The trunk is fastened with a
combination lock.
He deftly dials the correct combination and
opens the lid.
Inside, mementoes from his youth.
A "HOW TO SAIL" book, a
stack of "GREAT EXFLORERS" magazines, and beneath it all, a
garment in a drycleaning bag.
Truman carefully lifts up the
plastic to reveal a schoolgirl's lavender cardigan decorated
with pearl beading.
He puts the cardigan to his nose and
breathes deeply.
Footsteps.
Truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk and
shuts the lid.
MERYL, standing close behind.
MERYL
What're you doing out here?
TRUMAN
(turning attention to an upturned
mower on the garage floor)
Fixing the mower.
Meryl doesn't look like she buys it.
MERYL
(concerned)
Your sister called.
She was worried about you.
TRUMAN
(matter-of-fact)
I saw my father on State Street dressed as
a homeless man.
MERYL
(attempting to comfort)
I kept seeing my brother for years after he died.
TRUMAN
(irritated at her subtle dismissiveness)
What do you want?
MERYL
I made macaroni.
TRUMAN
I gotta go out.
About a replacement...
(hastily adding)
...mower blade.
Meryl nods, not at all convinced.
After an uncomfortable
pause, she turns and heads back to the house.
TRUMAN'S CAR.
DUSK.
TRUMAN motors down a busy shopping street, crowded on both sides
with PEDESTRIANS.
As he drives, he tests his car radio.
Adjusting the tuner knob, he finds a station.
FEMALE VOICE (from radio)
...west on Atlantic...he's making a right
on Woodhaven...
Truman glances up at the street signs along his route and finds
that they coincide exactly with the streets quoted on the radio.
Distracted, he almost bowls over an OLD LADY on a crosswalk.
MALE VOICE (from radio)
...God, Truman almost hit Marilyn!...he's
on the move again, passing the Burger King...
Truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out. Suddenly
there is a piercing blast of feedback.
He looks up and, as far
as the eye can see, every PEDESTRIAN, MOTORIST and SHOPKEEPER
along the street suddenly winces in pain and holds their right
ear at exactly the same moment.
MALE VOICE
(from radio, in distress himself)
...something's wrong.
Change frequencies...
Truman tries to pick up the channel once again but without
success.
TRUMAN'S CAR.
NIGHT.
VERONICA knows the form.
As TRUMAN pulls away from the curb,
she is already removing the lavender cardigan from the
drycleaning bag on the back seat.
She drapes the cardigan
around her shoulders.
VERONICA
Bout time you got this thing cleaned.
(half-joking)
Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady
wear it.
Truman passes her the brown paper bag without reply.
Veronica
removes a bottle of perfume and proceeds to liberally apply it.
VERONICA
(examining the bottle)
God, do they still make this stuff?
What's the Sell-By Date?
FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.
NIGHT.
From a vantage point in a disused tower high above the park.
CHRISTOF and CHLOE watch as Truman's Oldsmobile enters the park
grounds and comes to a stop near the large metal framed globe,
the Unisphere.
Both Christof and Chloe wear earpieces, a
miniature television propped at their feet shows a close-up
picture of TRUMAN and VERONICA inside the car.
CHLOE
(into a flip-phone,
condescending)
...you see him messing with the antenna...what
did you think would happen?..."lapse of
concentration", is that what you call it?
I call it amateur-hour...
(sarcastic)
In case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to
do it over.
Christof, totally unfazed, regards his zealous young assistant
with affection and even a mild amusement.
CHLOE
(as she hangs up, querying the
smile that plays around his lips)
You think this is funny?
CHRISTOF
The mask has slipped before.
Everything
can be explained.
TRUMAN kills the lights and he and VERONICA exit the car
unaware that they are being observed.
CHRISTOF
(adopting a more serious tone
as he returns his attention to Truman)
What's dangerous is that he makes the connection
between what happened today and the girl.
We focus on Truman and Veronica as they take a seat at the edge
of the pool surrounding the great steel globe.
VERONICA
Like I say, I don't normally do this.
I gotta charge extra.
Truman nods his agreement and forks over several bills.
Veronica deposits the money in her purse and perches herself as
modestly as possible on the edge of the fountain.
When she is ready, Truman tenderly places his arm around her
shoulder.
Veronica responds, hesitantly, becoming immersed in
her role.
She reaches out her own hand and rests it on the
nape of his neck.
Slowly both heads drift together, but stop
just short of their lips meeting, agonizingly close.
So close
they can feel each other's breath, barely a sliver of daylight
separating them.
Then finally their lips touch in the most
gentle of caresses.
They hold the kiss for another long moment and then
simultaneously break.
As they look into each other's eyes,
Truman goes to say something but Veronica hushes him by placing
a finger to his lips.
Then abruptly she moves out of frame, the
cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste.
From Truman's POV we focus on the cardigan on the pavement,
triggering a flashback in his head.
HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.
DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.
As with Truman's previous flashbacks, this scene appears to be
playing on a television screen.
However, on this occasion it is
also accompanied by CHRISTOF's comments from his perch in the
tower above the park.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
He's re-created the event on and off for a
number of years.
We've never understood what
prompts him to indulge the fantasy, or for that
matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy
to approach her in the first place...
A SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, carrying a stack of books, spies
LAUREN, sixteen going on thirty-five, wearing the lavender,
beaded cardigan at her open locker.
She is entertaining two
GIRLFRIENDS with what appears to be a lewd tale.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
We'd noticed them making eyes at each other
for some weeks but never thought he'd say
anything.
She was a year older, wrote poetry,
way out of his league...
Truman, obviously terrified, musters the nerve to approach the
lockers.
The three girls look up, surprised by the
interruption.
TRUMAN
(to Lauren, tongue-tied, a strangled greeting)
Hi.
GIRLFRIEND 1
(to Lauren as the two girlfriends
abruptly depart)
See you in class.
Lauren is unsure whether or not to follow her friends.
TRUMAN
Lauren, right?
Her name is carefully written in blue ink on the covers of her
text books.
LAUREN
No.
TRUMAN
(ignoring her lack of interest)
Look.
I was wonder--
LAUREN
--I can't go out with you.
TRUMAN
I haven't asked you yet.
LAUREN
Well when you do, that's my answer.
(softening)
I'm sorry.
It's not up to me.
TRUMAN
(summoning up courage from somewhere)
Why, you married?
Lauren smiles despite herself.
TRUMAN
I'm not asking you to have my children,
just a pizza.
How about Saturday?
LAUREN
(adamant)
No.
TRUMAN
Friday?
Lauren looks around the deserted school corridor.
LAUREN
Now.
TRUMAN
Right now?
We got finals.
LAUREN
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
Truman hesitates.
LAUREN
(impatient, looking anxiously around)
Well, what do you want to do?
THE PICTURE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN SUDDENLY FAST-FORWARDS AT
SUCH SPEED IT BECOMES A BLUR - THEN RETURNS TO NORMAL SPEED.
TRUMAN'S CAR.
NIGHT.
TRUMAN drives VERONICA back to her turf.
She smokes a
cigarette, flicking ash out of the window.
TRUMAN
Veronica, what do you know for sure?
VERONICA
For sure?
(taking a long drag on her cigarette
as she gives the question due
consideration)
The nuns at my school, they used to say,
"The whole of life is faith."
Truman regards his companion in a new light.
He comes to a stop
at the corner where he picked her up.
VERONICA
(giving Truman an affectionate
peck on the cheek)
On the house.
HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.
DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.
Another televised flashback.
The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN
stands reflectively beside Sylvia's open and vacated locker.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
We removed all physical trace of her
but we couldn't erase the memory...
ANOTHER SHORT BURST OF FAST-FORWARD AND THEN THE PICTURE RETURNS
TO NORMAL SPEED.
HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY.
DAY
In a secluded corner of the library the SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD
TRUMAN sits at a table surrounded by a stack of glossy women's
magazines.
By tearing out individual facial features - eyes.
nose, mouth, ears, chin, hair - from photographs of YOUNG WOMEN
in the magazine's advertisements, Truman has been able to
improvise a composite picture of Sylvia.
The montage is a passable likeness although Truman is not
completely satisfied with Sylvia's nose.
He toys with
several nose examples before reluctantly settling for one.
He stares wistfully at the completed picture.
ANOTHER BURST OF FAST-FORWARD
SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN'S HOUSE.
DAY.
SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN enters the front door.
His older
sister, RAQUEL, has been awaiting his arrival.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
When he decided to go after Sylvia, we
were forced to intervene once again...
TRUMAN
(excited)
I've got something to tell you, Sis.
RAQUEL
(adopting a low, serious tone)
I've got something to tell you too.
TRUMAN
(unable to contain his news)
I'm going to Australia.
RAQUEL
Mom's real sick.
Truman's face falls.
As he enters the bedroom where his ill
MOTHER lies gazing at the ceiling, we focus on his EXCHANGE
STUDENT APPLICATION that he has inadvertently crushed in his
hands.
THE FLASHBACK SEQUENCE OVER, WE RETURN TO THE PRESENT TIME WITH
THE IMAGE NO LONGER APPEARING ON A TELEVISION SCREEN.
TRUMAN'S CAR.
NIGHT
TRUMAN turns into his street but stops several houses short of
his own driveway and kills the car's engine.
In the light of a
streetlamp, Truman opens his briefcase and removes the framed
photograph of his wife, MERYL.
But he turns his wife's face
away from him and opens the clasps on the back of the frame.
Removing the backing, he exposes the composite picture of SYLVIA
we witnessed in the flashback of his youth, worn and faded by
the years.
With the frame on his lap, Truman retrieves a
handful of paper fragments from his jacket.
Noses.
He tests
the likeness of each one in turn.
Unsatisfied that any of the
new noses is an improvement, Truman tosses them out of his car
window.
We watch the paper fragments blowing in the breeze as
Truman's car proceeds down the street and into his driveway.
BAR SOMEWHERE.
NIGHT.
In a quiet bar, a WAITRESS patiently explains her viewpoint to
the BARMAN.
A PATRON on a barstool, eavesdrops.
WAITRESS
She was willing to lose him if it meant he
could find himself.
(registering the barman's blank look)
Never mind.
UTOPIA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
MORNING.
TRUMAN slams through the front doors into the reception area.
It is deserted, no one stationed at the administration desk, the
corridors empty.
He runs down a vacant corridor, pushing open
classroom doors as he goes.
They are all unoccupied.
Finally, he stands outside the gymnasium.
The childrens'
voices can still be heard.
Truman takes a deep breath and
bursts through the double doors.
The room is empty save for a large reel-to-reel tape recorder
in the middle of the basketball court playing a continuous tape
of childrens' voices.
The recorder is attached to speakers on
tall stands facing the ventilation ducts.
Truman stares at the
machine in disbelief.
INSURANCE COMPANY.
DAY.
From the office window on the twelfth floor, TRUMAN can observe
the glass building down the street.
He ponders the black,
mirrored box.
LAWRENCE appears at his side.
TRUMAN
You ever been into the AMT Building?
LAWRENCE
(following Truman's gaze)
Not since they begun reconstruction.
(referring to the file
in Truman's hands)
What're you doing with that?
TRUMAN
(defensive)
I'm going to visit a site.
LAWRENCE
What for?
TRUMAN
Because I never do.
LAWRENCE
(placing a hand on Truman's arm)
That's why we got adjusters.
TRUMAN
(looking at Lawrence's hand
on his arm)
You got a problem with me going?
LAWRENCE
I got a problem with you not doing your job,
Burbank.
You already screwed up once this week.
TRUMAN
Let me worry about that.
Truman exits with the report.
After waiting only a matter of
seconds for an elevator, he impatiently enters the stairwell.
As soon as he disappears from sight, a grim CHRISTOF emerges
from a nearby office, shadowed as always by CHLOE.
They
approach Lawrence with the familiarity of business associates.
LAWRENCE
680 West 89th.
Christof nods.
Chloe opens a flip-phone to make a call.
INSURANCE CO. - STAIRWELL.
DAY.
An out-of-breath TRUMAN arrives on the second floor landing of
the stairwell to find two burly MOVERS blocking his path
with a large office desk they are attempting to transport.
Truman considers retracing his steps, then without warning
clambers over the mahogany barrier.
MOVER 1
Hey, would it kill ya to wait?!
SUBWAY.
DAY.
TRUMAN paces impatiently on an empty subway platform with other
frustrated passengers.
He loses patience and suddenly
turns and runs up the stairs.
TAXI CAB.
DAY.
TRUMAN sits seething in a traffic jam that exists for no
apparent reason.
TRUMAN
(impatiently to driver)
Is there another way?
Can't you get around
this?
DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.
DAY.
TRUMAN'S face stares out from a televison monitor.
We slowly
pull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the
first until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room
the size of a football field.
The curved bank of monitors, suspended by cables from the
ceiling, gives the appearance of a giant patch-work mobile.
Investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from
all over New York City, covering every facet of Truman's life.
Camera angles from the interior of Truman's house, his backyard,
car, subway station, office, the deli he frequents, the seashore
to which he is drawn, the park he visits with Veronica, the
abandoned freeway where he golfs with Marlon, many of the
locations strangely devoid of people.
Beneath the video wall is a state-of-the-art mixing desk, its
illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom.
Facing the
desk, several OPERATORS in high-backed, high-tech swivel chairs,
wearing the slimmest of headsets.
SIMEON, a meticulous young
man with a penetrating gaze, sits directly in front of the
largest of the monitors, co-ordinating camera angles.
CHRISTOF stands over Simeon's shoulder, staring intently at the
live picture of Truman now seated at a streetside cafe,
continuing to inspect his surroundings.
CHLOE hovers in the
background.
There is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the
production crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first
time.
Christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a
microphone on the control panel.
CHRISTOF
...Everybody stay focused...remember who
you are...
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
The on-air monitor shows TRUMAN from the ring's POV, revealing
that the small center diamond contains a miniature, hidden
camera.
Truman suspects nothing.
He looks up to find two well-to-do 3OGGERS, out for a lunchtime
run, making their way down the street towards the cafe.
Truman
happens to glance at the sneakers of one of the joggers.
He
springs to his feet and blocks the joggers' path.
CHRISTOF
(staring at the monitor)
Damn!
Unseen by Christof, his Assistant Director, Simeon takes a
moment of pleasure from the older man's distress.
CONFERENCE ROOM.
DAY.
CHRISTOF is in deep conversation with two executives.
MOSES, a
contemporary of Christof but more jaded and debauched-looking
and ROMAN, a fresh-faced, younger man.
CHLOE hovers in the
background.
A monitor, suspended from the ceiling shows a
surveillance shot of TRUMAN and MARLON pulling into a beach
parking lot in Marlon's van.
The glass conference room looks out onto the vast control
facility where SIMEON continues to call the shots, all too aware
of the closed-door discussion taking place in the background.
CHRISTOF
(marveling, excitedly referring
to Truman on the monitor)
I can't believe how much he's shoved down.
That he
sensed the significance at aged seven and clung
to it so fiercely.
Roman paces, agitated, unimpressed.
Moses, mnore respectful.
CHRISTOF
(gesturing to the clifftop on the
monitor pointedly excluding Roman
from the conversation)
You remember, Moses, it used to end right
there, before the expansion.
ROMAN
(unable to contain his anxiety
any longer)
Christof, the cracks are starting to show.
CHRISTOF
(reassuring, keeping
himself in check)
I'll paper over them.
CHLOE
(coming to the defense of her mentor)
Truman's had bouts of paranoia before and
recovered.
ROMAN
(adamant, faintly hysterical)
No, not like this.
It's compromised.
Becoming unwatchable.
Too much for Christof.
He wheels on the young man.
CHRISTOF
Fear?
Doubt?
Is that what you have
trouble watching?
Perhaps you don't like
watching yourself.
Roman is stung into silence.
MOSES
(realizing his colleague is in
over his head, including Chloe
to save Roman's face)
Why don't you two wait outside?
Reluctantly Roman and Chloe exit and join Simeon at the video
wall.
CHRISTOF
(instantly more comfortable in the
company of a man his own age)
He's jumped the rails, Moses, that's all.
We'll
get him back on.
MOSES
You know why they're so nervous.
The birth of
Truman's child is going to double revenue.
For God's sake don't let him upstage you.
(indicating Simeon through
the glass walls)
You've been grooming a successor.
CHRISTOF
He's not ready.
MOSES
Him or you?
CHRISTOF
(jaw setting firm, referring
to Truman on the monitor)
You can't pull him back in without me.
(more reflective)
He's just acting out of character.
MOSES
What if he's in character?
What if he's
starting to act in character at last?
Have
you ever considered that?
SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.
DUSK.
The comfortably furnished room of a writer.
Walls lined with
books.
Desk overlooking the sea, strewn with notes, photos and
other reference material.
Sylvia's name on the spine of several
published volumes.
Pages of unfinished manuscript, handwritten
in blue ink.
SYLVIA stands at a bookcase, looking for inspiration.
As she
pulls out a book, a magazine falls to the floor.
Truman's
missing copy of Time Magazine.
His face on the cover with the
headline,
"Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".
Sylvia retrieves the magazine.
In front of a nearby mirror, she
holds Truman's photographed face next to her own, for a moment
imagining them together.
Then, catching herself, she quickly
lowers the magazine, left alone with her own reflection.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE.
NIGHT.
We see TRUMAN's disturbed face reflected in the screen of his
television set, montaged over that of ROBIN LEACH, host of
"Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous".
MERYL, wearing her robe,
head against Truman's chest, sips from a bottle of beer.
MERYL
(attempting to open him up)
What's going on, Truman?
You're not yourself.
TRUMAN
(vague)
Maybe you just don't know me very well.
DINING ROOM SOMEWHERE.
NIGHT.
CHRISTOF eats a sumptuous meal in an ornate private dining
room with an elegant WOMAN, thirty years his junior.
Playing
silently on a monitor on an antique side table is a surveillance
shot of TRUMAN and MERYL slumped in front of their television.
CHLOE, enters the room and nods an apology to Christof's dinner
companion - a woman her own age.
Christof's companion shrugs
resignedly.
Christof registers Chloe's thinly disguised
resentment, enjoying the rivalry.
Chloe inserts a cassette tape into a nearby VCR.
Christof
wipes his mouth with his napkin and picks up his wine glass as
he gives the television his full attention.
A commercial for
"GLOBAL TRAVEL" begins to play.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE.
NIGHT.
TRUMAN continues to watch "Lifestyles" restlessly.
However, as
he goes to get up from the sofa, MERYL starts to slide down his
chest towards his lap.
MERYL
We could do it right here, like we used to.
The program cuts to a commercial break.
The commercial
is for "Global Travel".
NARRATOR
(from television)
Travelling Down Under?
Global Travel is
turning rates to Australia upside down.
Round
Trip to Sydney only $829.
One way, $465.
Global Travel at Broadway and 44th...
Truman perks up at the commercial while Meryl's attention is
elsewhere.
TRUMAN
(abruptly getting up)
Lemme go to the bathroom.
MERYL
Don't be too long.
Truman exits the living room.
However, on his way to the
bathroom he hesitates at the kitchen table.
He surreptitiously
lifts the platic-coated plaid tablecloth to reveal numerous
bills laid out flat beneath it to keep the stash hidden.
CHRISTOF'S BEDROOM.
DAWN.
CHLOE pulls back long, white silk drapes to reveal a spectacular
view overlooking the Hollywood Hills.
CHRISTOF rouses from his
enormous round bed.
His DINNER COMPANION also stirs, waving
coyly to Chloe as she modestly covers herself, only mildly
perturbed by the intrusion.
Chloe switches on the television
set in the extravagent bedroom.
Playing on the set are TRUMAN
and MERYL still fast asleep in their own bed.
CHRISTOF
What happened overnight?
CHLOE
He couldn't do it, even on the sofa.
CHRISTOF
(smiling to himself)
God, that thing of his must be psychic.
(matter-of-fact)
He didn't masturbate?
CHLOE
Not for the last two inonths.
Chloe exits and Christof climbs out of bed.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE.
MORNING.
MERYL emerges from the bathroom, ready for work, surprised to
find TRUMAN sitting at the kitchen table.
MERYL
(rubbing ointment into her wrists)
Aren't you gonna be late?
TRUMAN
I got a call in the area.
(nodding to her wrists)
What's the case?
Anything interesting?
MERYL
(dispassionate)
Rape on the subway.
Truman's eyes widen.
We see a quick flashback in Truman's head
of the two YOUTHS assaulting the WOMAN on his train.
MERYL
They're guilty as hell but they'll walk.
No
witnesses.
Her word against theirs.
(picking up her bag to leave)
Maybe we could meet for lunch today.
Meryl gives him an affectionate kiss and exits the back door.
Truman waits for the sound of Meryl's car to disappear down the
road and exits himself.
COURT BUILDING.
MORNING.
TRUMAN enters the courtroom building.
A crush of DEFENDENTS,
FAMILIES, ATTORNEYS and POLICE OFFICERS.
Truman goes to enter
a courtroom but a SECURITY GUARD blocks his path.
SECURITY GUARD
You a witness?
TRUMAN
Er, yes...
(suddenly losing heart)
No, no I'm not.
SECURITY GUARD
Closed session.
Before the guard can move him on. Truman sneaks a look at
proceedings through the courtroom door window.
He recognizes the two YOUTHS sitting at the defendent's table.
A PROSECUTOR is on his feet, addressing the JURY.
MERYL is
working attentively at her stenotype machine, her fingers
rapidly pressing the keys.
However, Truman notices a glaring
omission.
There is no paper emerging from Meryl's machine.
The
roll of paper tape sits on the floor beside her chair leg.
TRAVEL AGENCY.
DAY.
The EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS inside GLOBAL TRAVEL are all doing
a last-minute primp, fixing their hair and checking their
clothes.
Suddenly, in unison, they take their positions and
begin working.
As TRUMAN enters GLOBAL TRAVEL, one CUSTOMER
looks up a fraction too quickly, anticipating his arrival.
Truman takes a seat at the only unoccupied desk, opposite a
female TRAVEL AGENT.
Feeling uneasy about a surveillance camera
in the corner of the room, he nervously obscures his face with
his hand.
TRUMAN
I wanna book a flight to Australia.
AGENT
Where exactly?
TRUMAN
(believing she is being
deliberately obtuse)
Australia.
AGENT
(a trace of condescension)
Where in Australia?
What city?
TRUMAN
Sorry, Sydney.
Sydney, Australia.
That's right.
AGENT
(entering the destination in her
computer)
For how many?
TRUMAN
(finding the question suspicious)
One.
AGENT
When do you want to leave, remembering, of
course, that you do lose a day on the way there?
TRUMAN
(more urgent than he intended)
Today.
AGENT
(reading off her computer screen)
I'm sorry.
I don't have anything for a
week.
TRUMAN
(suspicious)
A week.
AGENT
(patiently explaining)
It's the busy season.
TRUMAN
(paranoia showing)
You sure you're not trying to keep me here?
You are a travel agent, aren't you?
Your
job is to help people travel, not keep 'em
where they are.
(pointing to the agent's
name tag, "DORIS - Travel Agent")
Or maybe you're a different kind of agent, Doris?
AGENT
(showing amazing restraint)
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship
departing for Australia tomorrow.
But you
wouldn't want to do that.
TRUMAN
Why wouldn't I?
AGENT
I thought you were in a hurry.
TRUMAN
(calming down)
That's right.
AGENT
You want to book the flight?
Truman pulls out a wad of money from his pocket and several
rolls of quarters from Marlon's vending machines.
The agent
looks askance at the pile of cash.
TRUMAN
You were expecting me, weren't you?
The travel agent ignores the question and prints the ticket.
AGENT
It's non-refundable.
INSURANCE COMPANY.
DAY.
Close up on typewriting appearing on a page.
"Please accept my resignation from
American Life & Accident, Inc. to
take effect immediately.
Yours tru"
TRUMAN gets up from the typewriter in mid-word and strolls to a
fellow AGENT's desk.
TRUMAN
(to agent, picking up
a dictionary)
"Yours truly..."
You spell "truly"
"l...y" or "e...l...y"?
INSURANCE AGENT
I always write "Yours faithfully..."
Truman finds the appropriate page in the dictionary and gazes at
the entry for a long moment.
He looks up, staring into the
middle distance.
His eyes widen as something clicks in his
mind.
Suddenly LAWRENCE snatches the dictionary from his hand.
LAWRENCE
Where the hell have you been, Burbank?
What the hell's going on?
TRUMAN
That's what I'd like to know, Lawrence.
The AGENTS in the other cubicles turn in their direction.
TRUMAN
I was just about to resign.
Isn't that
a laugh?
I just realized there's nothing
to resign from, is there?
LAWRENCE
Listen, don't bother with the resignation.
Just get the fuck outta here.
TRUMAN
(addressing the whole office)
Why're you all pretending?
Huh?
(gesturing to a computer terminal)
What is this a front for?
Why aren't I in
on the joke?
Was I away that day?!
Noting two colleagues exchanging a look, he pulls the computer
off the desk to get their attention.
It lands on the floor with
an expensive crash.
TRUMAN
(hysterical)
I'm talking to you!
Who am I?!
LAWRENCE
(taken aback by the sudden violent act)
You better get outta here or I'm calling Security.
TRUMAN
(mimicking)
"Security!
I'm calling Security".
Truman picks up the framed photograph from his desk, containing
SYLVIA's hidden likeness.
Suddenly he wheels on Lawrence,
pinning him to a cubicle wall.
TRUMAN
You don't believe a single word you're saying!
(to the assembled group)
None of you do!
(suddenly talking to a sprinkler
head in the ceiling)
You hear me?!
We see Truman's manic face from the sprinkler head's POV.
Truman stomps off down the corridor, other Insurance Agents
giving him a wide berth.
He shoves computers, desk lamps and
pot holders off desks as he goes.
CONTROL ROOM SOMEWHERE.
DAY.
CHRISTOF is once again standing at the picture window in the
dimly-lit control room where we first encountered him.
Behind
him, the fronds of the palm tree sway in a gentle breeze.
The
sky, a cloudless, cobalt blue in sharp contrast to the overcast
day in New York City.
SIMEON, co-ordinating camera angles, sits in front of the
largest of the monitors that shows a live picture of TRUMAN
stuck in his car in gridlock.
SIMEON
(talking quietly into a
slim headset)
...and back to the close-up...
CHLOE's attention is focused on a subsidiary monitor displaying
a freeze frame of TRUMAN reading the dictionary a few minutes
earlier.
CHLOE
(to a hard-bitten Operator, staring
at the dictionary)
Do you think he sees the entry?
OPERATOR
Hard to tell.
CHRISTOF
(sarcastic)
Why don't we ask him?
CHLOE
(snapping back, referring to the book)
I don't know how it got there!
(to Operator)
Enhance.
Christof turns his back on the screen and stares out the window.
We focus on an enhanced picture of the dictionary's text.

TRUMAN'S CAR.
DAY.
As TRUMAN drives, he stares, paranoid, at seemingly innocuous
features in his Oldsmobile - his rearview mirror, steering wheel
insignia, speedometer, airconditioning ducts - and peers up at
the streetlamps lining the roadway.
SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.
DAY.
A dozen-or-so of SYLVIA'S FRIENDS, including the MAN we have
seen before, sit around a table on the balcony in the afternoon
sun, talking animatedly.
A TEN-YEAR-OLD SON of one of the
guests has strayed into the living room and switched on the
television set hidden away in an antique bureau.
SYLVIA. emerging from the kitchen, is taken aback by what she
sees playing on the screen.
The MAN on the balcony catches
her look as she swiftly switches off the TV.
She gently takes
the child's hand and leads him outside.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.
DAY.
MERYL is pouring herself ice tea when TRUMAN enters.
MERYL
Where have you been?
I've been calling you
all day.
TRUMAN
Have you been concerned, Meryl?
Nice name.
"Meryl".
I always liked it.
MERYL
(matching his sarcasm)
Nice of you to say so after eight years.
TRUMAN
Actress's name, isn't it?
What's your
real name?
MERYL
(rolling her eyes)
Oh, God.
What's got into you?
TRUMAN
Take a break. Meryl
(a knowing, almost foolish grin)
I know.
MERYL
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.
I thought I'd make my potato salad.
Remind me...
TRUMAN
(irritated)
Drop it, I said.
It's over.
MERYL
(rambling on)
...we need more charcoal.
TRUMAN
Shut up!
MERYL
I'm gonna take a shower.
TRUMAN
(catching her wrist)
No.
We're going for a drive.
MERYL
What?!
Despite her protests, Truman drags Meryl out the back door
and towards his car.
TRUMAN
(as he shoves her into
the Oldsmobile)
For years I've been saying I want to go
some place, well now I'm ready to go.
Let's
just jump in the car and go.
TRUMAN'S CAR.
DAY.
TRUMAN holds MERYL's wrist to stop her exiting the car and
accelerates out of the driveway in reverse without looking.
TRUMAN
(as they speed down the suburban street)
I thought maybe, Atlantic City.
MERYL
(trying to mask her anxiety)
You hate gambling.
TRUMAN
That's right.
I do, don't I?
MERYL
So why do you wanna go?
TRUMAN
Cos I never have.
That's why you go places,
isn't it?
Cos you're curious.
I haven't
been curious since I was seven years old,
y'know that?
Back then you'd have to nail me
to the floor to keep me in one place.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
All eyes watch the large monitor as surveillance cameras track
Truman's speeding car.
CHRISTOF
How long to take Atlantic City out of
mothballs?
SIMEON
We could be up and running...three hours maybe.
CHRISTOF
Give me a number five gridlock on the
Jersey Turnpike.
TRUMAN'S CAR.
DUSK.
TRUMAN and MERYL are hemmed in by a traffic snarl on the New
Jersey Turnpike.
We observe the Oldsmobile on a television
lens from the POV of a tail-light on the car ahead.
TRUMAN
(a manic edge to his voice)
So much traffic, this time of day.
Does
that strike you as peculiar?
On the side of the road, TWO MOTORISTS, are arguing over a
minor collision.
TRUMAN
(sneering at the sight of
the motorists)
Look at them.
You believe they're
fighting?
I don't believe it.
(shouting out the window
to the motorists)
Why don't you slug him, really make it authentic?
Without warning, Truman suddenly exits the freeway.
But
his move is anticipated.
At the end of the offramp a pack of
cars suddenly appears.
Other vehicles fill the gap behind.
TRUMAN
(to Meryl, marveling)
Blocked at every turn.
Beautifully
synchronized, don't you agree?
MERYL
(incredulous)
You blaming me for the traffic?
TRUMAN
Should I?
MERYL
You've never been on this road before.
You don't know what it's like.
TRUMAN
(manic)
That's true.
We could be stuck here
for hours.
Could be like this all the
way to Atlantic City.
Truman suddenly veers the Oldsmobile onto the sidewalk.
MERYL
What the hell are you doing?
TRUMAN
You're right.
Let's go back.
I'm
sorry.
I don't know what got into me.
Truman rejoins the New Jersey Turnpike, heading back towards
Queens, the roadway now relatively free of traffic.
MERYL
Would you please slow down, Truman?
Truman floors the Oldsmobile.
The car flies past the exit for
Route 276.
He continues along the Jersey Turnpike.
MERYL
Truman, that was the turnoff!
TRUMAN
I've changed my mind again.
What's Maine
like this time of year?! I've never been to
Maine.
(Truman looks up through the
windshield at a helicopter
tracking his progress)
Or let's just see where the road takes us.
MERYL
(pleading)
Let me out, Truman.
You're not right in the head.
You wanna destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
TRUMAN
(eerily calm)
I think I'd like a little company.
CONTROL ROOM.
DUSK.
CHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON and the other OPERATORS follow Truman's
progress from a helicopter shot - the Oldsmobile optically
circled to ease identification.
Christof jabs his finger at the
rapidly thinning traffic surrounding Truman's vehicle.
CHRISTOF
(to Simeon)
What the hell is wrong with the "carousel"?
Keep them together.
SIMEON
(agitated)
They're rusty.
We can't keep up.
(rueful aside)
We don't know where he's going any more.
CHLOE
Oncoming is very thin.
TRUMAN'S CAR.
DUSK.
As he speeds erratically, TRUMAN glances at the streets either
side of the freeway, where he discovers a distinct lack of
moving traffic.
TRUMAN
(to the anxious Meryl at his side)
Look down there, Meryl!...No cars!
I don't
run into traffic.
The traffic follows me around.
(excited by his discovery)
We're in a moving pack, don't you see?
Truman abruptly exits the rapidly emptying freeway.
CONTROL ROOM.
DUSK.
CHRISTOF
(enthusing)
He's so close!
It's tantilizing!
CHLOE
You want to pull him over?
CHRISTOF
No police.
Not yet.
We shadow him.
We don't want him to panic.
CHLOE
He's trying to outrun the traffic.
CHRISTOF
He's trying to outrun the world.
Keep him
on this route.
(to Simeon who is consulting
someone on his headset)
Are we ready?
Simeon nods.
Executives, MOSES and ROMAN have entered the
control room.
They hover nervously in the background.
TRUMAN'S CAR, WESTCHESTER.
DUSK.
TRUMAN is forced to slow once again behind a line of other cars
at a police roadblock.
At the head of the line, the cars are
being turned around by POLICE OFFICERS, who are also contending
with a swarm of NEWS REPORTERS and TELEVISION CREWS.
TRUMAN
(to Meryl)
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
MERYL
There's been an accident, Truman.
We
have to go back.
TRUMAN
No.
There's no accident.
It'S just more stalling.
Truman slows beside a POLICE OFFICER.
TRUMAN
What's going on?
OFFICER
(grim-faced, indicating the nearby
Indian Point nuclear power plant)
Leak at the plant.
They had to shut her down.
TRUMAN
Is there any way around?
OFFICER
The whole area's being evacuated.
A precaution.
Truman falls in line behind the cars making a U-turn when, all
of a sudden, he guns his car and swerves past the barricade.
CONTROL ROOM.
DUSK.
CHRISTOF, a trace of panic in his eyes, turning to CHLOE.
CHRISTOF
Did he see it?
CHLOE
I don't think so.
The reason for Christof's concern becomes all too apparent as
the helicopter passes over the power plant, where the struggling
TRUMAN is being escorted away.
We see an aerial shot from the
helicopter as it emerges directly above the Sydney skyline.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.
NIGHT.
MERYL and TRUMAN sit at their kitchen table.
Truman stoic,
tears rolling down Meryl's cheeks.
Truman's airline ticket
torn to shreds on the table in front of them.
MERYL
Let me get you some help, Truman.
You're
not well.
TRUMAN
(ignoring her tears and medical advice)
Why do you want to have a child with me?
You can't stand me.
MERYL
That's not true.
TRUMAN
(suddenly angry)
Don't lie to me!
Truman's raised voice backs Meryl to her feet.
Truman follows,
getting in her face.
TRUMAN
Tell me what's happening?!
MERYL
(frightened but remaining poised)
I thought you knew everything.
What could
I tell you?
TRUMAN
(backing her up against
the kitchen bench)
You're part of this, aren't you?!
Meryl grabs a kitchen knife from a wooden block to protect
herself.
MERYL
Truman, you're scaring me!
Truman looks in her eyes and, with surprising swiftness,
grabs her wrist and disarms her.
TRUMAN
No, you're scaring me, Meryl!
Truman grabs Meryl by the hair and turns the knife on her.
While pressing the blade to Meryl's throat, Truman starts to
march her around the room, talking to the walls, light
fixtures, a mirror, doorknob, framed picture, blank television.
TRUMAN
Stop this now or I kill your leading lady.
(to a lamp)
I know you can hear me.
CONTROL ROOM.
NIGHT.
CHRISTOF and the OTHERS watch the monitors spellbound as TRUMAN
looks directly into one camera lens after another.
ROMAN is the
first to crack.
ROMAN
(entreating Christof)
Get somebody in there!
CHRISTOF
(quiet but firm)
No.
SIMEON
(siding with the executive,
showing his true colors)
She's in trouble!
We've got to help her!
Christof, never taking his eyes from the monitor, leans into
the microphone.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.
NIGHT.
We see an extreme close up of MERYL's ear.
Unheard by TRUMAN,
from her inner car, we hear a familiar voice.
CHRISTOF (O.C.)
He's bluffing.
Call his bluff.
MERYL
(in reply to the voice in her
head, half-strangled due to the
pressure of the knife)
Do something...
Upon hearing her remark, Truman's eyes widen.
Sensing that she
too is addressing a third person, he jerks her head around to
read her face.
TRUMAN
(wild-eyed)
Who are you talking to?!
MERYL
(incredulous)
You're the one talking to the walls!
TRUMAN
No.
You said, "Do something."
Who were you
talking to?
I swear I'll kill you, if
you don't tell me.
Meryl takes the chance to spin out of his grasp and dashes to
the bedroom but before she can barricade the door, Truman
forces his way inside.
They both tumble onto the waterbed
causing it to rock back and forth.
Gripping Meryl's hair,
Truman throws aside the bed covers.
TRUMAN
(distraught, referring to the bed)
How could you buy this damn thing when you
know he drowned in front of me?!
Truman raises the kitchen knife but instead of stabbing Meryl
begins to slash viciously at the waterbed, opening a large gash.
TRUMAN
You have any idea what it's like to drown?
Truman drops the knife and forces Meryl's head into the gaping
hole in the bed, submerging her head in the tepid water.
She
thrashes her arms wildly trying to free herself.
Truman reluctantly jerks her head back out of the water.
MERYL
(gasping for air)
Truman, stop it!
(to the ceiling)
Don't let him do it!
TRUMAN
(to a light fixture, threatening)
I'll kill her!
He dunks her head into the water a second time, holding her
head down longer this time.
She continues to struggle.
Suddenly, the front door chimes.
Startled, Truman lets Meryl up
for air.
TRUMAN
(sneering at Meryl)
Right on time.
Cops must be telepathic.
Meryl spots the kitchen knife within her reach but Truman beats
her to it.
Grabbing the knife by the blade, he slices his hand.
TRUMAN
(wincing in pain)
Damn!
At knifepoint, Truman marches Meryl down the hallway to the
front door.
The doorbell chimes a second and third time, more
insistently.
TRUMAN
(shouting through the closed door)
Stay where you are or I'll kill her!
MARLON (O.C.)
Truman?
It's me, Marlon.
Truman flinches.
He was so convinced it would be the police.
He takes a step back against the hallway wall.
Before he can
decide what to do, Marlon has opened the unlocked front door
to be confronted with the sight of Truman holding the knife to
Meryl's throat, blood streaming from his own wound.
Marlon locks eyes on Truman.
Sizing up the situation, he slowly
but decisively removes the knife from Truman's hand.
Meryl
wrenches herself free from Truman's now limp grasp, and
collapses into Marlon's arms, sobbing.
MERYL
(distraught, dropping character,
forgetting herself)
They were going to let him kill me!
CONTROL ROOM.
NIGHT.
CHRISTOF leans over a microphone at the mixing desk, feeding the
lines to Marlon, immersed in the role.
CHRISTOF
(hushed tones)
...and the last thing I'd ever do is
lie to you...
Recognizing the importance of the moment, his colleagues stand
around in awe at Christof's spontaneous performance, arguably
superior to Marlon's own delivery.
MARLON
(staring into Truman's
eyes, repeating the
words in his ear)
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.
(pause)
Think about it, Truman, if everybody's
in on it, I'd have to be in on it too.
I'm not in on it cos there is no it.
Truman's head slowly drops in surrender, his doubts draining
away.
Marlon embraces Truman in a bearhug.
Truman looks over his shoulder to the sky where a single star
shines.
CONTROL ROOM.
NIGHT.
From his chair, CHRISTOF modestly accepts the congratulations of
his COLLEAGUES.
The two executives, MOSES and ROMAN are at the
head of the line, their earlier disagreement suddenly forgotten.
CHLOE gives Christof a warm hug.
MARLON, accepting a towel from a P.A., still in wardrobe,
approaches and kneels beside the arm of Christof's chair.
grasping his hand.
MARLON
(leaving his head close to
Christof)
I can't thank you enough.
I don't know
what happened.
He was so close.
It threw
me.
I'm indebted.
Christof gives Marlon a consoling pat on the shoulder and
Marlon withdraws.
Finally Christof's Assistant Director, SIMEON, approaches and
offers his hand.
Christof hesitates before shaking.
Simeon
returns to the monitors, now showing TRUMAN alone at the dock or
Long Island.
Christof stares out the window to conceal an
expression of quiet vindication.
A LTVING ROOM SOMEWHERE.
NIGHT.
The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before sit on their sofa
gazing straight ahead.
On the teievision in front of them,
a live picture of TRUMAN - the first time we have seen him
broadcast to a viewer's set.
He is reading a book at his kitchen table, unaware of the
cameras recording him.
The scene alternates between a wide master shot, a medium tight
shot, a close up of Truman's face and two insert shots - one
over the shoulder shot of the page he is reading and one from
another angle showing the book's title, "To The Ends Of The
Earth - The Age Of Exploration".
At one point, a sponsor's border appears on screen, tastefully
framing the "action" with the message, "FOLGERS Coffee - Good To
The Last Drop."
After several seconds, the border disappears.
Suddenly tbe live picture of Truman shrinks into a window on the
screen to accomodate a title sequence that begins to piay around
the edge of the image.
Overlapping scenes from Truman's life
appear in chronological order, from infancy to adolescence and
finally adulthood.
A graphic, "TRUMAN - Total Record Of A Human
Life", appears on screen accompanied by an introductory
narration.
NARRATOR (O.C.)
You are watching "Truman - Total Record Of
A Human Life".
Everything that occurs here
is real.
There are no re-creations or
interruptions.
Due to the live and unedited
nature of the program, viewer discretion is
advised.
The title sequence is replaced by an INTERVIEWER, mid-fifties,
conservative suit and hair, sitting opposite CHRISTOF in a Larry
King-style interview setting.
Projected in the background is
the live picture of Truman, immersed in his book.
STUDIO.
NIGHT.
INTERVIEWER
(to camera)
Welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty
eight of "Truman" and there can scarcely have
been a more momentous week in the show's
history.
I'm your host, Michael Conners, and
this is a special edition of "Tru Talk", the
forum where we discuss and analyze recent
events with the show's award-winning creator
and producer, Christof.
(referring to the image
of Truman in the background)
I remind viewers that as this is a living
history, it is our practise to keep the image
of Truman on screen at all times.
(turning to Christof)
Welcome.
CHRISTOF
Thank you.
INTERVIEWER
Before we start taking calls, the huge surge in
ratings over the last few days, how do you hope
to sustain that audience now that Truman appears
to have reconciled himself, returned to "normal"?
CHRISTOF
Ratings have never been our primary goal.
I
imagine we'll lose those voycurs only interested
in witnessing Truman's latest torment.
However
I'm certain our core audience will remain loyal.
INTERVIEWER
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does
raise the perennial question.
What keeps us
watching one man twenty-four hours a day -
eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in
contemplation?
CHRISTOF
It has to be the reality.
During this segment, we cut to a cross-section of VIEWERS -
the NIGHTWATCHMEN, the two OLD WOMEN on their sofa, the
BARMAN and the WAITRESS - listening to Christof's theories on
their viewing habits.
CHRISTOF
We've become increasingly frustrated watching
actors give us phony emotions, bored with
pyrotechnics and special effects.
While the
world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's
nothing fake about Truman himself.
No scripts.
no cue cards.
It's not always Shakespeare but
it's genuine.
That's how he can support an
entire channel.
INTERVIEWER
A window onto the human condition?
CHRISTOF
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
Not only
does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he
gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
INTERVIEWER
But how do you account for the popularity of
those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
CHRISTOF
We find many viewers leave him on all night
for comfort.
Haven't you ever watched your
child or your lover sleep?
INTERVIEWER
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
The Interviewer presses a blinking illuminated button on his
desk's high-tech phone terminal.
INTERVIEWER
(into speaker phone)
Charlotte, North Carolina, for Christof.
MALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
Hello?
INTERVIEWER
You're on, caller.
Go ahead.
MALE CALLER 1
Christof, it's a great honor to speak with you.
CHRISTOF
Thank you.
MALE CALLER 1
Truman has never been closer.
The way he looked
directly at us, spoke to us for the first time.
Do you think he'll ever work it out?
CHRISTOF
I don't believe so.
Not now.
He tested his
world, as we all do at certain times, and
eventually it passed the test.
You have to
understand, he is a man made-for-TV, the world
he occupies his only frame of reference.
No, for him to come even this close to the
truth is a remarkable testament to his
instincts.
The Interviewer presses another line on his terminal.
INTERVIEWER
Sacramento, California, you're on "Tru Talk".
MALE CALLER 2 (O.C.)
How much of a strain has the last few days
placed on the actors?
CHRISTOF
Working on "Truman" has always been a huge
commitment for an actor, not just in terms
of separation from friends and family, but
since Truman essentially drives the plot,
it's a never-ending improvisation.
Recent
events have raised the pressure but also the
prestige.
INTERVIEWER
(cutting off the call)
Of course Truman has always been very much in on
casting.
CHRISTOF
As with our own lives, the only people he can't
cast are his family.
Otherwise he has final
approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead
role as was the case with his only real friend,
Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit
player.
INTERVIEWER
(pressing another line)
Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with world-renowned
videographer, Christof.
MALE CALLER 3 (O.C.)
Christof.
I've admired your work my whole life,
although I can't say I've seen it all.
CHRISTOF
Who can?
MALE CALLER 3
Can you settle an argument for me?
What's
the longest time Truman has been off-camera?
CHRISTOF
(trace of pride)
In his entire life, forty-two minutes.
A
technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of
that time.
The remainder generally results
from blindspots, in the early days, when Truman
would stray out of range of our cameras.
INTERVIEWER
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.
(pressing another line)
Amagansett, Long Island, you're on "Tru Talk".
FEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
How can you say Truman lives a life like any other?
CHRISTOF
(sensing the thinly disguised
resentinent in the caller's voice)
I believe that to be so.
I often feel the only
difference between Truman's life and our own
is that his is being more thoroughly documented.
We all play our allotted roles--
FEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
--He's not a performer.
He's a prisoner.
The Interviewer goes to cut off the call but Christof
holds him back.
CHRISTOF
(rising to the challenge)
--He can leave at any time.
If his was more
than just a vague ambition, if he were
absolutely determined to discover the truth,
there's no way we could prevent him.
I think
what really distresses you, caller, is that
ultimately he prefers the comfort of his "cell"--
FEMALE CALLER 1
(as if trying to convince herself.
giving herself away)
--No, you're wrong!
He'll prove you wrong!
He can still do it!
CHRISTOF
(a thought occurring, looking
directly into camera)
Do I know you, caller?
Your voice sounds familiar.
SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.
NIGHT.
SYLVIA, finger on the button of the phone where she has cut off
the call, stares at CHRISTOF on her television screen.
It is she who is the Female Caller.
Christof seems to stare
back at her as the talk show continues.
INTERVIEWER
(from television)
Recording a human life from birth to death,
that's still the intention?
You still believe
Truman has more to contribute?
CHRISTOF
(still reflecting on the last call)
More than ever.
By unwittingly allowing us to
witness his struggles, he's constantly forcing
us to evaluate our own lives.
He gives us hope.
INTERVIEWER
Let's take another call.
(pressing a line)
London, England you're on "Tru Talk".
FEMALE CALLER 2
By definition Truman has to be free of censorship,
but has the recent violence and profanity
caused a problem for the sponsors...?
Sylvia shuts out the conversation on the television, focusing on
the window that displays TRUMAN, still buried in his book.
She comes close to the screen, catching his melancholy.
She
has a camera and a white envelope in her hand.
With a look of
resolve, she takes her fountain pen and writes Truman's name
on the envelope in her familiar blue ink.
MASTER TAPE ROOM.
NIGHT.
Row upon row of digital video cassettes occupy one entire,
cavernous room - "Truman" and a date on the spine of each
cassette.
Suspended from the ceiling, a monitor shows a live
picture of TRUMAN sleeping on the sofa.
Sitting in front of a playback monitor, CHLOE is transfixed by
Truman thirty-four years earlier, a FETUS in his mother's womb.
CHRISTOF (O.C.)
What are you looking for?
Chloe tries to conceal her startlement at CHRISTOF's unexpected
entrance.
CHLOE
(not taking her eyes from screen)
He was premature, wasn't he?
CHRISTOF
Only by two weeks.
CHLOE
Curious even then?
Like he couldn't
wait to get started?
CHRISTOF
(feeling out where the
conversation is headed)
His eagerness to leave his mother's womb
also meant he was the one selected.
CHLOE
What was it like, the first show?
CHRISTOF
The ultimate live television.
In competition
with five other unwanted pregnancies - the
casting of a show determined by an air date
- he was the one who arrived on cue.
CHLOE
Is it true what you said...on the show tonight?
About letting him go if he wanted it badly
enough.
Would you really do that?
Christof stares at his assistant, weighing her loyalty.
CHRISTOF
It won't come to that.
OFFICE.
DAY.
The suitably crestfallen TRUMAN stands in front of his boss,
ERROL, sitting behind his ostentaciously large desk.
LAWRENCE
lounges on the guest sofa, enjoying Truman's dressing-down.
BANK.
DAY.
TRUMAN approaches the bank window.
The teller is the YOUNG
WOMAN whose child Truman attacked in the street.
She takes a
step back at the sight of Truman, apprehensive, the
confrontation fresh in her memory.
Truman glances at the names on the checks in the young woman's
hand, realizing how she was able to identify him in the street.
He begins to apologize profusely.
TRUMAN'S GARAGE.
DUSK.
TRUMAN enters the garage, carrying Sylvia's sweater.
He
breathes in the scent one last time and reluctantly replaces it
in the trunk.
With a sense of finality, he lowers the lid and
fastens the lock.
OFFICE BUILDING, LOWER MANHATTAN.
MORNING.
In an office building high above Manhattan's financial district,
a ROBOTIC MANNEOUIN in a 3-piece suit stands at an upper-story
window mechanically lifting a coffee cup to its mouth.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
CHRISTOF is seated at the control desk, directing the morning
session, SIMEON assisting, CHLOE at his shoulder, a buzz of
excitement in the room.
CHRISTOF
I hope we've got fresh extras.
CHLOE
(consulting a clipboard)
The rotation was made this morning.
CHRISTOF
(staring at a monitor, irritated)
I don't like the couple with the baby.
They'd never be together.
The COUPLE with the stroller are promptly moved further along
the street.
CHRISTOF
Who's doing wardrobe?
I keep seeing the
same wardrobe...
SUBWAY STATION.
MORNING.
TRUMAN spills out of the subway car with hundreds of other
COMMUTERS.
We hear Christof's off-camera voice, as always
unheard by Truman.
CHRISTOF (O.C.)
...everybody back to One...
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
CHRISTOF covers his microphone to deliver an aside to SIMEON,
from whom he has temporarily assumed the role of director.
CHRISTOF
I bet he doesn't stop at the newstand.
As predicted, Truman walks by, barely glancing at a newspaper's
banner headline, "NUCLEAR POWER PLANT REOPENED".
Christof scans
the shot options available to him on the video wall.
CHRISTOF
...Bodycam Two...
The large On-Air Monitor cuts to Truman, via the point-of-view
of an approaching PEDESTRIAN.
For an instant, the unaware
Truman looks directly into the lens of the disguised camera.
CHRISTOF
...streetlight eight...
The monitor cuts to an overhead shot from a streetlamp.
The
camera continues to follow Truman's progress.
CHRISTOF
...ready, Car-Cam One.
Go to One...
TRUMAN enters his office building as a taxi cruises by.
CHRISTOF
...and cut to interior...
Truman is immediately picked up by a hidden camera inside
the building where he exchanges a half-hearted greeting with an
ancient SECURITY GUARD.
CHRISTOF
...looser...
The camera widens the angle.
CHRISTOF
...and action, Vivien...
(aside, proud of his casting)
Looks just like Truman's mother at that age.
VIVIEN, an insurance adjuster approaches the elevator button at
the same time as Truman.
However she reaches for it after
Truman has already turned his back.
CHRISTOF
(incensed)
Damn, she missed her mark!
(impatiently to Simeon)
Why do we bother with walk-throughs if
nobody pays attention?
Give me a two-shot
of Truman and Vivien...go to the master
...hold the elevators...
(mustering patience, into microphone)
Vivien, press the elevator button again
...and make sure you catch his eye this time...
INSURANCE OFFICE LOBBY.
DAY.
A second time, TRUMAN's brief encounter with VIVIEN goes like
clockwork.
As instructed, she hammers away at the elevator
button and throws a conspiratorial look to Truman.
The elevator
car duly arrives and Truman's eyes follow Vivien's rear as she
sachets into the lift.
For a moment he appears to glance at a
piece of gaffer tape on the marble floor.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
CHRISTOF
Good!
Perfect!
Cut to the interior...
The monitor cuts to the inside of the elevator, rapidly
filling with co-workers.
CHRISTOF
...and Lawrence...
Just as the doors are about to close, LAWRENCE oozes in.
He
gives Truman a smug smile.
CHRISTOF
...nice look, Lawrence...and, Vivien...
The elevator doors open and Vivien exits with two co-workers.
LAWRENCE
(admiring aside to the remaining
fellow-males in the elevator)
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
Truman doesn't seem to share Lawrence's enthusiasm for the
comely young woman.
He is miles away.
STUDIO - CONFERENCE ROOM.
DAY.
Assembled around a long oval table for a story confernce are
several principal characters in Truman's life - MERYL, MARLON,
ERROL, TYRONE, RAQUEL, VERONICA and the new actress, VIVIEN,
sitting slightly apart from the rest of the cast.
CHRISTOF takes his place at the head of the table, a large
monitor showing TRUMAN drinking coffee in his cubicle at
American Life plays silently behind Christof's head.
CHRISTOF
(to the meeting, referring to
Meryl by her real name)
Regrettably, I have to inform you that
Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract.
All eyes turn to Meryl.
She looks at the floor.
CHRISTOF
I'm sure we can all respect her reasons.
Meryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co-
star Marlon, now out of wardrobe, wearing an Armani suit.
CHRISTOF
Her separation from Truman will be
orchestrated over the summer.
(more up-beat)
However, I'm pleased to announce that
television's first on-air conception will
still take place.
You witnessed the initial
contact this morning.
(glancing to Vivien, once
again using her real name)
You all know Claudia from her work in theatre.
Thankfully, Truman doesn't.
The rest of the cast nod politely in Vivien's direction.
CHRISTOF
(referring to the bound documents
CHLOE passes to each cast member)
This is a copy of Claudia's back story.
Her character's name will be Vivien.
She's the new adjuster at the office.
The cast idly flip through the documents, prominently stamped on
the cover, "NOT TO BE TAKEN ON SET".
CHRISTOF
We intend to entice Truman into the
affair as soon as possible.
Claudia will
make her advance at the seminar Truman's
attending next week.
Details are in your
schedules.
I'm sure you'll all make Claudia
welcome.
MARLON
(injecting a note of levity, more
sophisticated than the character he plays)
Question is, will Truman make her welcome?
The cast snickers.
CHRISTOF
(immediately back to business)
I don't have to tell you, how critical
the next few weeks will be.
This takes us
into the next generation.
When Truman's
child is born, the network will be switching
to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives.
VIVIEN
What happens when Truman and the baby are
both on camera together?
CHRISTOF
There will simply be duplicate coverage.
VIVIEN
(mischievous)
Let's just hope we don't have twins.
CHLOE
(uncharacteristically flippant)
When Truman dies do we go back to the
single channel?
The cast turn in her direction.
Christof has a second occasion
to question his Assistant's loyalty.
A BAR SOMEWHERE.
DAY.
The BARMAN, WAITRESS and PATRON we have seen before, observe
TRUMAN on the television above the bar.
The cameras track
Truman's progress, walking along Broadway.
As he ducks into a
sex shop, the threesome at the bar exchange looks.
Inside the
store, Truman appears apprehensive.
BARMAN
What's he doing in there?
PATRON
Meryl's at her mom's.
Maybe he's got an urge.
On screen, Truman looks through some X-Rated video titles.
WAITRESS
(referring to Truman's overcoat)
What's with the coat?
BARMAN
(smirking at the irony)
Maybe he doesn't wanna be recognized.
Truman bumps into a display of sex paraphenalia, knocking an
item to the floor.
PATRON
(remarking on Truman's clumsiness)
Nervous.
Truman tries to right the display and hurriedly exits the store,
the cameras following his journey as always.
BARMAN
(exasperated)
Oh God, he never bought nothing.
WOMAN
Give him a break.
It's taken him thirty-
four years to get the nerve to go in there.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.
NIGHT
We focus on a list left by Meryl on the refrigerator, several
pages long.
The kitchen itself is a bombsite.
More than the
cliche dishes in the sink - dozens of cardboard boxes stacked
haphazardly on the floor.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.
NIGHT.
The usually orderly bedroom is also a mess.
Blankets piled in a
heap.
Several large, half-filled cardboard boxes cluttering the
room.
A chair in an odd position near the bed.
Clothes strewn
everywhere.
Hardly an inch of floor space remains uncovered.
TRUMAN is asleep in bed, the damaged waterbed replaced with a
standard mattress.
Although he is completely covered from head
to toe in bedding, the outline of his body is still clearly
visible.
CONTROL ROOM.
NIGHT.
Close up on the On-Air monitor in the temple of a control
room.
It displays a wide shot of Truman's darkened bedroom
filmed through the green hue of the night vision cameras.
Assistant Producer, SIMEON, and his VIDEO OPERATORS slouch in
their swivel chairs paying scant attention to the screen.
Simeon gives his instructions in a lethargic, metronomic manner.
SIMEON
...Ready two.
Go to two.
Operator, eating a doughnut, presses one of the illuminated
buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes to a close
shot of Truman's covered head.
The camera stays on the
blanketed head for a long moment.
SIMEON
And back to the medium.
Another button is pressed and the angle changes.
A trace of
frustration is evident in the control room.
Recording a
sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to
contend with Truman's recently aquired camera-shyness.
SIMEON
...and wide...
OPERATOR
(aside to Simeon)
Could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried?
SIMEON
(shrugs)
That loser pays our salary.
OPERATOR
He's given up on himself again.
SIMEON
Who cares?
Makes life easier for us.
He is what he is.
At the far end of the great room, one of the large double
doors opens and CHRISTOF enters, as always accompanied by CHLOE,
carrying a leather-bound folder.
Simeon and the Operators
subtely straighten in their chairs.
Christof pretends not to
notice.
He is staring intently at the On-Air monitor.
CHRISTOF
When did he start sleeping like that?
SIMEON
About the time Meryl left.
CHRISTOF
Is that the best shot we can get?
SIMEON
What's to see?
Christof watches Truman, a trace of concern in his eyes.
CHRISTOF
(referring to the debris in Truman's bedroom)
What happened to the room?
SIMEON
He started to reorganize.
I was going to
call you.
But half-way through, he gave
up and fell asleep.
Apparently satisfied, Christof turns to an operator.
CHRISTOF
I want to check the set-ups for tomorrow's
insurance convention.
Reading off the notes in Chloe's folder, the operator punches
up a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors.
They
show a generic-looking Marriott Hotel, devoid of actors.
A
banner in reception reads, "WELCOME AMERICAN LIFE & ACCIDENT".
The Operator looks to Christof for approval and realizes his
producer's attention has wandered.
Christof is staring at the
sleeping figure of Truman on the On-Air monitor.
CHRISTOF
Give me a shot from his wedding band.
SIMEON
(pointing out the ring on Truman's
bedside table)
He took it off.
CHRISTOF
(a trace of concern)
Why is he so still?
He's too still.
Christof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it to
his ear.
CHRISTOF
Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify.
An operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel.
Christof and
his colleagues listen to Truman's steady breathing in their
headphones.
Simeon and the Operators nod, reassured that
nothing is amiss.
Christof is not so easily convinced.
CHRISTOF
Give me a preview.
An ECU on his torso.
A camera hidden in the room's bedside lamp zooms in to Truman's
prone outline...while the breathing remains steady, the body
does not rise and fall.
CHRISTOF
(anxious, barking a command to Chloe)
Phone him.
Chloe picks up a phone connected to the desk and dials.
CHRI STOF
(anticipating Chloe's question)
Wrong number.
The phone on the bedside table, inches from Truman's head,
begins to ring.
Truman doesn't flinch.
SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.
NIGHT.
SYLVIA walks up from the seashore where she has been taking a
late night swim.
Hearing the telephone ringing; she rushes
to pick it up.
However, after lifting the receiver, the phone
continues to ring.
The sound is coming from her television, left on in the bureau.
On the screen, TRUMAN sleeps, seemingly undisturbed by the call.
Sylvia, drying herself, watches with fascination.
CONTROL ROOM.
NIGHT.
CHRISTOF and the CREW are now highly agitated.
CHRISTOF
(a trace of panic)
He didn't drink tonight?
No pills?
Every question receives a shake of the Assistant's head in
reply.
CHRISTOF
Hang up!
Chloe promptly cuts the connection and Truman's phone
ceases to ring.
CHRISTOF
Get Marlon over there.
CHLOE
Under what pretext?
CHRISTOF
(letting his anxiety show)
Any fucking pretext!
Christof turns his back on the monitors, his mind racing.
CONTROL ROOM.
NIGHT.
CHRISTOF, wide-eyed, stares at the image on the On-Air monitor
of MARLON and his bizarre companion.
Marlon is frozen, staring
into camera.
CHRISTOF
(quiet but firm)
Cut transmission.
Simeon hesitates, unsure if has heard correctly.
He looks to
Christof for confirmation, his finger poised over an
"EMERGENCY" button.
CHRISTOF
(enraged)
I said, "Cut"!
Christof lunges forward and presses the button himself.
SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.
NIGHT.
SYLVIA watches agog as the scene in Truman's bedroom on
her television screen is replaced by the "TRUMAN" logo and the
message, "TECHNICAL FAULT.
PLEASE STAND BY."
CONTROL ROOM NIGHT.
CHRISTOF has taken his place at the control panel.
On the bank
of monitors in front of the mixing desk, the OPERATORS
systematically search through the numerous set-ups in Truman's
home and neighborhood.
Occasionally MARLON or an EXTRA appear
in frame as they fan out and begin a man-hunt.
While the on-Air monitor continues to play its test-card,
Christof and Simeon concentrate on another isolated monitor
playing in fast-rewind, time code in the bottom right corner.
It is a recording of the night's transmission.
Simeon stops on
the last on-camera appearance by TRUMAN.
They watch Truman, on-screen, switch off his bedroom light and
climb into bed fully clothed, immediately pulling the covers
over his head.
As the light is switched off, the recording
camera automatically switches to night vision.
Simeon continues
to play at normal speed, now and then scrolling forward in fast-
forward mode.
Christof suddenly points to the screen.
CHRISTOF
There.
Freeze...Zoom into the chair...
Simeon types the appropriate command.
CHRISTOF
Enhance.
On the blown-up screen, between a cardboard box and a chair leg,
it is barely possible to make out Truman's hand as he crawls
commando-style from his bedroom, his inflatable replacement
already positioned in the bed.
CHRISTOF
(referring to the debris)
He wasn't making a mess.
He was engineering
a blind spot.
CHLOE
How does he know where the cameras are?
CHRI STOF
I don't know.
(noting the time-code on the monitor,
staring into the back of Simeon's head)
All I know is we've been filming a blow-up
doll for the last three hours.
Simeon feels the hostility.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
The systematic search of the monitors continues.
They now
reveal that dawn has broken on the set.
SIMEON
(hanging up the phone)
We've declared a curfew.
Only the extras
required for the search are on the set.
Everyone else is at first positions.
CHRISTOF
All prop cars accounted for?
SIMEON
He has to be on foot.
He has the world's
most recognizable face.
He can't disappear.
All heads turn to CHLOE as she enters the grand control room
with a status report.
CHLOE
The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug
if we don't make a statement within the next
hour.
The media is in a feeding frenzy.
The phone
lines are jammed.
Every network has a pirated shot
of Harlon and the dummy.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
While his COLLEAGUES monitor the bank of screens, CHRISTOF has
been joined by the two ever-anxious studio executives, MOSES and
ROMAN.
MOSES
(to Christof who is still studying
the faces in a row of SEARCHERS)
Rumors are circulating he's dead.
ROMAN
(pacing nervously)
The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts.
CHRISTOF
(unconcerned, referring to the static
"STAND BY" graphic, now accompanied by
soothing classical music)
Why?
We're getting higher ratings for
that graphic than any time in the series.
BARROOM.
DAY.
The television behind the bar carries the still graphic.
BAR PATRONS animatedly discuss Truman's fate over their drinks.
Some place bets with each other over the outcome.
LIVING ROOM.
DAY.
The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before stare intently at the
graphic on their televisions.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
The fan of EXTRAS reaches the harbor and automatically turns to
make another sweep.
CHLOE
(referring to the empty streets)
When we flush him out how do we explain this?
CHRISTOF
(deadpan)
We tell him the truth.
Chloe looks askance at Christof.
CHRISTOF
(joking darkly)
We're making a movie.
SIMEON
(hopeful)
We'll get him on this next sweep.
CHRISTOF
What have we missed?
SIMEON
It's just a matter of time.
CHRISTOF
No.
We've missed something.
Christof turns his back on the screens.
Over his shoulder,
we see a monitor displaying a view of the harbor.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
CHRISTOF is spooling through significant scenes in the history
of "TRUMAN" on a preview monitor.
He pauses on the scene of SYLVIA and TRUMAN at the fountain
in Flushing Meadow Park in the show's seventeenth season.
Sylvia has her finger to Truman's lips.
Christof presses
"PLAY" on the mixing desk.
SYLVIA
(from monitor)
You remember when you were a little boy...
Christof fast forwards, then presses PLAY once again.
SYLVIA
...Trust that boy...
Christof jabs the "PAUSE" button, freezing the picture.
He
recites the words to himself.
CHRISTOF
Trust that boy...
(to Simeon)
We're not watching the sea.
SIMEON
(confused)
Why would we?
CHRISTOF
Sweep the harbor.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
CHRISTOF and his colleagues concentrate on a live aerial shot on
a preview monitor, skimming over the calm, featureless sea.
Suddenly in the distance there appears a single sail etched
against the horizon.
SIMEON
That's him!
CHRISTOF
Resume transmission.
Simeon punches a button and the image of the sailing ship is
instantly transferred to the large On-Air monitor.
SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.
DAY.
SYLVIA, dozing on the sofa, suddenly blinks open her eyes as the
classical music on the television is abruptly replaced by the
sound of a helicopte's rotor blade.
Sylvia focuses on the screen, her breath taken away by the sight
of TRUMAN at the wheel of the Santa Maria.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
CHRISTOF
(staring intently at the On-Air monitor)
What do we have on that boat?
Simeon scans a computer shot list.
He types in a code.
A
camera from the main mast of Truman's ship activates.
Truman,
unaware of the camera, is concentrating on steering the vessel.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
CHRISTOF and the other PRODUCTION STAFF watch TRUMAN from the
buoy's POV as he sails by.
HELICOPTER.
DAY.
The HELICOPTER PILOT continues to circle.
PILOT (over P.A.)
Alter course or we fire on your vessel.
TRUMAN screams again at the chopper and gestures wildly at the
pilot.
TRUMAN
Get the hell away!
It's my life!
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
CHRISTOF
(into microphone to pilot, eerily composed)
Fire a warning.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
SIMEON
(shocked at the near miss)
Jesus!
God!
Is he out of his mind?
CHRISTOF
(composed, into microphone to pilot)
Pull back.
SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.
DAY.
SYLVIA kneels on the floor in front of the television.
As
Christof's cameras dwell on her likeness - the composite picture
still covering the ship's compass - she allows herself a brief
moment of satisfaction but she does not dare to hope too much.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
CHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON, and the OTHERS have been joined in the
control room by MARLON, MERYL, KIRK and AUDREY.
CHRISTOF
How long will another chopper take?
SIMEON
By the time we pick up the pilots, too long.
CHRISTOF
We have to stop him for his own good.
Turn him back with the elements.
SIMEON
(hesitant)
There's no rescue boat in the area.
He
won't know what to do.
MOSES
(trying to appeal to Christof's
sense of reason)
For God's sake, Chris.
The whole world
is watching.
We can't kill him in front
of a live audience.
CHRISTOF
He was born in front of a live audience.
(never taking his eyes from
the screen, reassuring)
Don't worry, he's not willing to risk his life
for the truth.
His doubts will turn him back.
Simeon reluctantly turns to a panel of controls on the desk
marked "WAVE", "WIND" and "RAIN".
After typing in a command, he
winds the controls towards their maximum settings.
CHRISTOF
Kill the lights.
Chloe searches Christof's face, trying to find the man in whom
she has believed for so long.
CONTROL ROOM.
DAY.
In contrast to his panic-stricken COLLEAGUES, CHRISTOF gives an
outward appearance of calm.
However a bead of sweat appearing
at his temple betrays him.
SIMEON
(agitated)
It's not working.
He can sail that thing!
ROMAN
How can he sail?!
He's in insurance!
He
hasn't set foot on a boat since he was seven!
MOSES
(to Christof)
On the behalf of the studio, I demand you
cease transmission.
CHRISTOF
(defiant, to Operators)
Keep running!
(to Moses)
I take full responsibility.
(to Operator in front of radar-style screen)
How close?
OPERATOR
Very close.
CHRISTOF
Capsize him!
Tip him over!
CHLOE
(unable to contain herself
any longer, entreating him)
You can't!
He's tied himself to the wheel.
He'll drown!
SIMEON
(staring at Truman on the monitor,
becoming affected by his display of courage)
He doesn't care...
CHLOE
(to Christof, lunging for the control panel)
You lied, you hypocrite!
The only way he can
leave, is dead!
Chloe lunges for the control panel but Christof throws her to
the floor.
CHRISTOF
(enraged)
Do it!
All eyes turn in Christof's direction, as he confirms Chloe's
accusation.
SIMEON
(staring at the On-Air monitor, numb)
It's too late...
CONTROL ROOM.
DUSK.
CHRISTOF and his PRODUCTION STAFF take in Truman's reaction
in silence.
BARROOM/ELECTRONICS STORE/HOME.
DUSK.
TRUMAN's cry echos around bars, offices, shops, homes and
streets - wherever a television is to be found.
No VIEWER
speaks.
They are stunned to silence, many teary eyed.
VIEWERS.
DUSK.
Spontaneous cheers and shouts of joy erupt from VIEWERS in their
various locations - bars, homes and offices.
Strangers hug each
other and dance in celebration.
CONTROL ROOM.
DUSK.
Even the cynical VIDEO OPERATOR jumps out of his seat - for the
first time in the film - and lets out a joyous whoop, forgetting
himself for a moment, caught up in the drama.
OPERATOR
Yeah!
Self-conscious, he takes his seat again almost immediately.
His
COLLEAGUES are transfixed by the live on-air monitor continuing
to play its only available shot, the open door in the sky -
Truman out of view.
SOUNDSTAGE.
DUSK.
TRUMAN finds himself on a small metal landing.
A steel ladder
rises above him to the height of "sky", the soundstage roof, so
high as to be barely visible.
The rungs also continue downward,
the depth of the "ocean-bed", to a studio floor far below.
Truman turns and looks back through the door he has just
entered.
Unsecured, the Santa Maria is beginning to drift away.
The sea he has feared since childhood, is nothing but an
enormous tank.
The sky, a massive cyclorama.
New York City, an
elaborate set.
And it is all housed within an impossibly large
soundstage.
Truman makes no effort to save the boat.
He shuts the door to
his world.
A sign on the back of the door reads, "CLOSED SET.
No Unauthorized Access."
Gradually he becomes aware of another
strange phenomenon taking place in the soundstage.
All around
him, thousands of light fixtures mounted in the cyclorama to
masquerade as stars, are slowly illuminating - switched on by an
automatic timer.
(The light fixtures match the one that almost
struck Truman's car at the beginning of the film.)
By artificial starlight, Truman begins his long descent of the
step ladder.
Below, a studio tram makes its way along the
soundstage perimeter, on the last tour of the day.
STUDIO TRAM.
DUSK.
As he drives, a well-scrubbed, young TOUR GUIDE delivers his
tired commentary into a microphone for the thousandth time to
the half-full tram of STUDIO VISITORS.
GUIDE
...the soundstage roof houses over eight
hundred thousand lights of varying intensities
to faithfully recreate the constellations...
However, the passengers are paying less attention than usual.
They stare, perplexed, at the television monitor above the
Guide's head, continuing to play the show's only available shot
of the open door in the sky.
SOUNDSTAGE.
DUSK.
TRUMAN suddenly steps in front of the tram.
The TOUR GUIDE
stands on the brakes, tram lurching to a stop.
The Guide looks
from Truman's haunted face to the monitor, hardly able to
believe his eyes.
Truman leaps on board, pressing his flare gun into the side of
the guide's head.
TRUMAN
(to the shocked passengers)
Nobody move!
(to the guide)
Drive!
The terrified Guide pulls jerkily away in the tram, resuming the
tour.
TRUMAN
(to the guide, gesturing to the microphone)
Keep talking.
Say whatever you say!
The Guide hesitantly resumes his commentary into his microphone.
GUIDE
Er,...the ocean tank contains over six hundred
and fifty million gallons of man-made salt
water, temperature-controlled...
Truman's attention drifts to the logo on the side of the tram -
"TRUMAN STUDIO TOUR".
He is suddenly aware of the tourists
gawking at him.
TRUMAN
(to TOURIST, camcorder around his neck)
Act normal!
Keep filming!
Truman ducks out of sight as a fleet of STUDIO SECURITY CARS
speeds towards the tram.
But they streak past, on their way to
the site of Truman's escape.
As he tentatively gets back to his
feet, Truman finds a CHILD standing in front of him with an
autograph book.
CHILD
Please, Mister Truman.
On the child's T-shirt, a large photograph of Truman's face.
CONTROL ROOM.
DUSK.
CHRISTOF talks anxiously on the phone, unaware of a shift in the
balance of power taking place behind his back.
The executives,
MOSES and ROMAN are huddling with SIMEON, making him an offer he
appears to welcome.
CHRISTOF
(into the phone)
What do you mean he's not there?
We can't
have lost him again.
On the far side of the control room, behind a huge curved
glass wall on a mezzanine floor, a studio tour tram passes by.
STUDIO TRAM.
DUSK.
TRUMAN crouches behind a seat on the tram, flare gun still
trained on the guide's head, taking in the gigantic video wall
displaying pictures from every facet of his life.
His heart sinks as he spies the monitor revealing the private
spot where he and SYLVIA met.
GUIDE
...on your left, the control room where the
angles are selected and the actors receive
direction.
Of course, the one place we can't
show you is the story department.
There is none.
(hesitant)
...Truman writes the script...
From Truman's POV we watch CHLOE approach CHRISTOF.
She has a
pure white envelope in her hands.
As Christof looks up to
acknowledge her, he almost makes eye contact with Truman on the
tram.
STUDIO LOT.
DUSK.
Still inside the studio complex, the tram enters the courtyard
of an indoor shopping mall.
Truman gift shops.
TRUMAN is momentarily frozen by the sight of window displays
full of books and board games carrying his likeness with titles
such as, "TrumanTrivia".
Video cassettes offering "Truman
Highlights".
His face emblazoned on T-shirts, caps, coffee mugs
and posters.
Even Truman Dolls and a model of his decaying
Oldsmobile are offered for sale.
The tram slows to a stop behind other trams at the tour's end.
STUDIO POLICE are checking the disembarking PASSENGERS.
Truman,
using the TOUR GUIDE as a shield, also exits the tram.
GUIDE
(frightened for his life)
Here he is!
It's him!
Truman contemptuously backhands the Guide across the face and
makes a run for it.
The guards give chase.
Truman runs into a
lookalike mannequin, dressed in a brown suit identical to his
own, promoting "TrumanWear".
He pulls his "double" to the
ground to block the guards' path.
Sprinting along a featureless corridor, he reaches a dead end.
GUARD
(into radio)
We've got him trapped.
Truman enters a doorway marked "NO ENTRY" to find a stairway
leading upwards.
He takes the stairs three at a time.
The footsteps and shouts of the guards not far behind.
Flight
after flight of stairs.
At one point, he loses his grip on the
stair's railing and his gun falls from his hand, clattering for
an eternity down the stairwell.
He finally emerges on a landing.
Lungs bursting.
One more
door.
He tries the handle.
It opens.
