          A New England postcard scene.  Children of all ages
          skating.  Some older boys, wearing team jerseys, play
          hockey.  Super: Cleaves Mills, Maine 1976.


          ANGLE - CLOSER TO FIND A SIX YEAR OLD BOY

          not at all a bad skater for his age but something of a
          clown too... this is JOHNNY SMITH... and he's trying to
          skate backwards, showing off for SARAH BRACKNELL (6) a
          pretty little girl who pretends not to notice as she skates
          more unsteadily, giggling with a couple of girlfriends...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sarah... watch this...

          But as he blindly skates backwards, he heads on a collision
          course toward...


          THE GANG OF HOCKEY PLAYERS

          chasing the puck in his direction...

                                        PLAYER#1
                        Hey!  Get out of the way!

          Johnny doesn't even hear the warning above the wind and
          kids' chatter... and never sees...


          THE 12-YEAR-OLD BOY (PLAYER#2)

          who collides with him at full speed...


          JOHNNY - SLOW MOTION

          goes sprawling through the air as Sarah watches in
            horror...


          ICE - SLOW MOTION

          as Johnny's head comes into frame, smacks hard against
          the ice... HIS SHORT BREATHS the only sound we hear...

          The boy continues to desperately try to break through the
          ice to escape the dark watery tomb... although we can't
          see his face, we can see now that he's wearing a hockey
          uniform...

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)

                        ...just leave it there.

          His eyes open and he catches his breath as though waking
          from a nightmare...

                                (gently joking)
                        Leave what where, fella?

                        What... happened?

                                        HOCKEY COACH
                        You hit your head.  We oughta get
                        you home.  Your folks might want
                        to take you in for an X-ray.

          As he helps Johnny to his feet, Johnny exchanges a glance
          with Sarah who's happy he's okay... Johnny's embarrassed.

                                        HOCKEY COACH
                        Okay, you guys.  Let's pack it in
                        for today.  Getting slick out
                        here anyhow.

          Everyone starts to move off the ice... Player#2, who
          collided with Johnny, looks back...


          LONG SHOT - HIS HOCKEY STICK

          is on the ice where it fell... nobody around it... and as
          the wind whistles ominously across the field, we know, we
          just know that he shouldn't go back for it... but no one
          is even thinking about what Johnny said...


          PLAYER#2

          casually skates over to his stick...


          ON JOHNNY

          as he's walking away... he stops, reacts and turns before
          he hears the sound...


          JOHNNY'S POV - LONG SHOT - PLAYER#2

          is bending down to pick up the stick as the ice CRACKS
          loudly and gives way... the boy disappears into the
          water...

          He sprints across the field back to the pond... as kids

          Matching the subliminal shot we saw just moments ago, the
          boy can't find the opening he fell through, disoriented,
          his hands encounter solid ice... he flails, pounds, trying
          to get out...


          JOHNNY

          moves toward the pond but his headache intensifies...


          THE HOCKEY COACH

          on his belly, sliding across the ice to the hole...

                                        HOCKEY COACH
                        Hold my legs!  Hold my legs! 
                        Where the hell is he?  


          ANGLE - PLAYER#1'S FACE ON THE ICE

          as he lays on his belly grabbing the coach's legs in a
          chain with the others... inches away from his face, under
          the ice in the water, suddenly the obscured ghostly blue
          face of Player#2 appears in a silent scream for help...
          Player#1 yells with shock...

                                        PLAYER#1
                        He's here.  He's under here!


          LOOKING UP AT SOLID ICE FROM UNDER WATER

          The boy continues to desperately try to break through the
          ice to escape the dark watery tomb... we can see obscured
          figures moving frantically above the ice... and now we
          stay for beats... and it seems forever... forever... and
          the boy's efforts begin to slow and then stop... until,
          finally, light breaks through from above... and we see
          the coach has used a skate to hammer through the ice...
          his arms reach down and grab the motionless body of the
          boy...

                        Pull!

          The chain of kids pulls the coach and the boy in his arms
          to stronger ice... and the boy is now coughing out water,
          shuddering from cold, but alive...

                                        HOCKEY COACH
                        Help me get him to the car!

          They carry him in a hurry toward the car... the others
          walk away from the pond still in shock... 

                                        SARAH'S VOICE

22A MAPLE LEAF - CLOSE-UP - DAY #1

          After the cold of the tease, we can almost feel the warmth
          of spring through the TV screen.  Green and lovely and
          perfect... Super: 1995... our shot rotates around the
          leaf like a kaleidoscope as it pulls back revealing a
          second and third leaf on branches of a tree and then dozens
          of leaves until we realize we're looking down from the
          tree top...

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        ...when we look at a tree from
                        below, we see bunches of leaves,
                        without composition or
                          organization, randomly spread all
                        over the branches... but nothing
                        in nature is random... from above,
                        we can see how each leaf has chosen
                        the absolute perfect position on
                        the tree to gain exposure to
                          sunlight...

          Our shot continues back to find Johnny Smith, now 26,
          lying on his stomach on a branch looking down at the
            leaves...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        This is nature's tapestry,
                          people... and it never ever fails
                        to astonish.

                        Mr. Smith...

          And as Johnny reacts to the voice from below, we continue
          our move to reveal as many as sixteen high school
          sophomores in the tree around Johnny... Johnny grins
          down...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good morning, Mr. Pelson.  We're
                          learning about photosynthesis
                          today...

          We move down the tree to find, Dave Pelson, 40, to whom

          Johnny drives a vintage Cadillac convertible, top down,
          into the driveway of a lovely home... hops out without
          opening the door... glances at a town car on the street,

                        young man could use some tutoring
                        in math.  Nothing personal...

                        Got any money left, Austin?

          The boy's look tells him, no.

          Johnny reaches into his pocket and pulls out a quarter...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Here.  I'll stake you.

          but Johnny's reaches over and guides him to 11-20...

          bigger and bigger, too... and the barker sweating now...
          on one spin, Johnny pulls the money off the board and the
          wheel stops at "OO, NO WINNERS", the barker reacts
          incredulous and spins again as Johnny points the boy to a
          new box, the boy pushes the money forward into the game...
          finally ending with...

          to get away... moving to find Johnny, incongruous,
          surrounded by the action...  


          UNCLE TRAN

          holds on desperately to his sister, the Doctor's mother
          seen earlier... explosions destroy buildings on all
          sides... the Trans are pulled apart by the panicked
          crowd... they reach out to each other... but now they are
          yards apart...


          UNCLE TRAN'S POV - BLOCKED BRIEFLY - LOSING SIGHT OF HIS
          SISTER - BUT THEN THERE SHE IS AGAIN, HER BACK TO US...

          Another explosion as mortar fire hits and Mother Tran
          falls dead...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE - ACT THREE - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS  40.

          JOHNNY

          surrounded by the fleeing mob, sees it, and reacts - how
          could this be?  Tran cries out...

                                        UNCLE TRAN
                                  (Vietnamese)
                        No... no... not my sister...
                          please...



          Johnny watches Uncle Tran being pulled away from his sister
          by the thrust of the crowd...

                                        UNCLE TRAN
                                  (Vietnamese)
                        My poor sister...

          Suddenly the scene FREEZES except for Johnny who walks
          through the frozen figures toward the man's sister... the
          CAMERA ANGLE PIVOTS around the frozen crowd... until Johnny
          moves to a new position where he can see the woman's body. 
          As he kneels --


          CLOSER ANGLE

          to see the dead woman is clearly not Mother Tran, but a
          woman dressed like her...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was a different woman.

                        The woman you saw killed was not
                        your sister.

          As the Trans react...          THE DEAD ZONE - ACT THREE - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS  42.



          The scene, except for Johnny, frozen.  Now, as he looks
          around, THE SCENE UNFREEZES... and he finds the real Mother
          Tran injured but alive, crawling slowly to the side of
          the road with some help from another refugee... as Johnny
            reacts...


  4949NEW ANGLE - MOTHER TRAN

          Incredibly she MORPHS as she limps, growing older and the
          street around them grows more contemporary... she's
          carrying a basket of potatoes down an alleyway... live
          chickens skitter around her feet....

                                        JOHNNY
                          Potatoes.


    5050MATCHING SHOT - JOHNNY - TODAY

          as he releases the grip of the old man... terribly
            exhausted by the experience...

                                        DR. TRAN
                        My mother was a potato farmer...

                                        JOHNNY
                        She still is...

          On Dr. Tran's reaction...



          A beautiful setting in back as Sarah wheels Johnny out...
          the conversation is painfully awkward...

                                        JOHNNY
                        As you can see, I put on my tux.

                                        SARAH
                        You look fine.

          Silence.

                                        SARAH
                          I didn't know if I should come. 
                        But I really wanted to.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm glad you did.

          She sits in an outdoor chair... silence... as they look
          at the grounds...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Still teaching?

                                        SARAH
                        Subbing now and then.  I left to
                        do something with my music.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good for you.

                                        SARAH
                        Wrote some country songs.  Didn't
                        work out.  So much for being the
                        next Shania.

                        music star.  I'll... I'll bring
                        you one of her CDs...
                                (beat, unsure)
                        ...do you know what a CD is...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, CDs were already around
                        when...

                                        SARAH
                        ...I wasn't... sure...
                                (beat, uncomfortable)
                        It's so pretty here.

          A beat.  He studies her. It's like they're strangers on a
          bus.  She's already run out of pleasantries.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't you just hate talking to
                        sick people?

                                        SARAH
                        Don't.  Please.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You never know what to say... you
                        try to be cheerful...

                                        SARAH
                          Johnny... oh God...

          And she moves to him, kneels and hugs him... as they
          touch...


          SCENE FREEZES ON HIS TOUCH AND THEN CONTINUES - WE STAY
          TIGHT ON THEIR CLINCH

                                        SARAH
                        I'm so sorry... it's all so cruel
                        and unfair...


  5353NEW ANGLE - THEY'RE IN THE SAME POSITION TOGETHER BUT NOW

          And Johnny, back in the wheelchair, reacts as he realizes
          that Johnny is his son.

                                        SARAH
                                (making the point)
                        He's a hockey player.

          They study each other with a knowing look a long time...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Does he know?

                                        SARAH
                        No.  Walt and I... we...we decided
                        to raise him as our child but...

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...You must be worried that I'll... 

                                        SARAH
                        ...I'll tell him now, of course...

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...No.
                              (a beat)
                        You've made a life, Sarah.  I
                        love you.  The greatest gift I
                        can give you is your freedom...

                                        SARAH
                        We've been friends all our lives,
                        Johnny.  That isn't going to
                        change.

          He studies her silently, loving her...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It has to.  Because I don't think
                        I could bear it now, Sarah.

          Sarah, tears flowing uncontrollably now, holds his face
          and kisses him tenderly, holds him close once more...

                                        SARAH
                        I'm so, so sorry.

          She runs off, sobbing... slow push to Johnny and we begin
          an appropriate music cue TBD (possibly a reprise of the
          song we used in Act One) as we begin a montage --


  5555JOHNNY BACK ON THE PARALLEL BARS

          This time, he's driven by the emotion of the last scene,
          an intensity in his eyes we haven't seen before... and as
          Johnny rebuilds his body --



          is also being rebuilt... much progress has been made...
          new wood frames have been installed around the damaged
            window...  Elaine, Maggie in her arms holding a slightly
          charred teddy bear, smiles as the workmen put the last
          wood plank into place...  


  5757BACK TO THE PARALLEL BARS - DAY #4

          Johnny pushing himself harder and harder... and Bruce is
            impressed...



          The figures of two men walking -- Bruce and Johnny using
          both canes...



          who just got out of a taxi, moving back to reveal the
          same street Johnny saw in his vision, now rebuilt and
          modern.  Tran, dressed in a suit and carrying a small
            suitcase, looks around at a world he barely remembers, a
          tourist in his own homeland...



          At a junky compact car, Johnny stands, now using one cane,
          with Bruce as Elaine, Allison, the Medical Technician and
          a small group of other hospital workers say good-bye...
          Allison is holding a homemade cake that says "Good Luck,
          Johnny" in handwritten icing... Johnny nods his
            appreciation as Allison hands it to Bruce who puts it in
          the trunk near a single suitcase...          THE DEAD ZONE - ACT FOUR - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS   51.



          Same day as prior scene.  Tran approaches a Vietnamese
          police officer to ask directions to an address on a piece
          of paper... he's also showing the cop the photo of his
            mother... the officer points him toward --


  6767ANGLE - AN ALLEYWAY

          and we've seen it before -- in Johnny's vision.  Tran
          moves into the alleyway, chickens, as we saw before,
          skitter around his feet...


          THE OTHER END OF THE ALLEYWAY

          delivers Tran to a magical open air marketplace... the
          only man in a dark suit, Tran moves among farmers selling
          their wares... fruits and vegetables are everywhere...
          but no potatoes yet...


          MOVING WITH HIM

          passing fresh fish... a rice vendor... then he pauses as
          he sees --


          ANGLE - A POTATO STAND

          several yards away, an old woman vendor, the only one
          around dressed in red, has her back to us...


          TRAN - SLOW PUSH TO HIS FACE


          VERY WIDE

          as the figure of the only man in a dark suit carrying a
          suitcase moves through the crowd toward the figure of the
          only woman in red... we can see no features from here... 
          Dr. Tran reaches the elderly woman, places his bag on the
            ground... she turns... for a beat they just stand there...
          and then he embraces her and their bodies shudder and
          they sink to their knees in each other's arms... surrounded
          by farmers and shoppers who pay no attention to them.

          The MUSIC CUE ENDS as we --

                                                                                  CUT TO:          THE DEAD ZONE - ACT FOUR - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS   52.



          ...his eyes still drawn to --

          LONG SHOT - THE BOY IN THE TREE

          hanging down like a monkey now...

                                        SARAH (O.S.)
                        I want him to know you, Johnny. 

          Johnny turns, sees Sarah moving up behind him...

                                        SARAH (CONT'D)
                        We don't have to tell him
                          everything.  But I want him to
                        know you.  

          They lock eyes for a long moment.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sarah...

          But she won't be stopped...

                                        SARAH
                                (calling)
                        Johnny, come here, there's someone
                        I want you to meet...

          The boy jumps down from the tree runs to them.  Johnny
          finds himself getting terribly nervous; he glances over
          at Bruce who is by the front door who grins, clearly part
          of a conspiracy.  Johnny Jr stops short in front of them
          out of breath...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey.  I'm Johnny too.  We've got
                        the same name.

          Johnny Jr. looks up at him and smiles shyly, tongue-tied
          as kids are with new people... he moves into the protection
          of his mothers' leg...

                                        SON
                        Can we go now, mom?  

          Johnny smiles at her... in effect telling her it's enough
          for one day...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  You can go now.  It's good
                        to meet you, Johnny.

          The boy acknowledges but is already on his way to her
          station wagon parked on the street.  Sarah looks at Johnny
          with love...

                        Welcome home.

          Johnny nods, pleased that she's forced the issue.  Sarah
          moves to the wagon... Bruce rejoins him...

                                        BRUCE
                        Nice family.

                        Yeah.  Somebody else's.

          Sarah drives away.  Bruce opens the back of the wagon,
            revealing the cake...

                        cake...  

          And he reaches in to pick it up, but as he touches it...


          THE SCENE FREEZES


          SUBLIMINAL FLASH - ALLISON HOLDING THE CAKE OUTSIDE THE
          HOSPITAL AS THEY SAID GOOD-BYE


          RESUME JOHNNY - SCENE CONTINUES

          as Johnny is struck with some sort of violent attack...
          his face goes pale, he gasps for air...

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh, man, not this again... come
                        on, do your biofeedback thing
                        like I taught you...

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...can't... I...

                                        BRUCE
                        Yes, you can.  Nice slow breaths. 
                        Visualize.  You're at the beach,
                        nice sunny day...

          But Johnny's eyeballs roll into the back of his head and --          THE DEAD ZONE - ACT FOUR - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS   57.



          as it breaks ground for a hole... it's raining, thunder
          and lightning... we see a pair of distinctive shoes worn
          by the man digging the hole...



          sinks to his knees...

                                        BRUCE
                        ... gentle waves rolling onto the
                          shore... breathe...

          But Johnny whips his head...



          is finished... the distinctive shoes move out of view and
          we stay a beat on the dirt as the pace of the rain picks
          up until wham a body falls into frame and the face stares
          at us in the shock of death... and it is the face of
          Allison...

                          ...Allison... Call Allison...
                        warn her... hurry...

          Bruce abandons the biofeedback, knows enough to take him
          seriously, takes out his cell phone, starts to dial... 
          we can hear thunder rolling in the distance...



          An isolated and narrow old town street lined with four-
            plexes... thunder rolls overhead as Allison gets out of a
          Volkswagon Passat that she just parked.  She looks up at
          the darkening skies that bring on a premature feeling of
          night, moves around back to open the trunk to take out
          some medical books when she hears the phone ringing inside
          her apartment... she hesitates a beat... but the phone
          won't stop ringing... and finally she runs up the walk
          and unlocks the door and runs inside...


          ANGLE - THROUGH THE WINDOW

          Just as she gets to the phone, it stops ringing.  She
          picks up the handle...

                          Hello...?

          She reacts as she gets no reply, sighs, hangs up and as
          she walks out of view, the camera moves to the sidewalk
          to find the distinctive shoes from Johnny's vision standing
          there... and as the first drops of rain begin to fall on
          the pavement...
