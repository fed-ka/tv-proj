
	Pandemonium:  everyone yelling, rushing, paper-shuffling
	at once.  An electrician balanced on a ladder re-wires 
	a ceiling fixture.  LOIS, CLARK, CAT and others gather 
	around a sketch artist's drawing table to one side of the 
	room.  In the eye of this hurricane stands PERRY WHITE.

		Turnaround!  Great shades of 
		Elvis!  What are we, Daily Planet 
		newspeople or second stringers 
		for the Weehawken Gazette?!

	newsroom falls nearly silent.

		Staff meeting.  Tomorrow.  Six a.m.

	The knot of people surrounding the artist, STAN, an over-
	weight, over-worked guy in his early fifties, have leaned in
	for a better view.


3	CLOSEUP - SKETCHPAD				3

	A rough drawing of Superman's face.  Stan fills in the 
	eye shade.  PULL BACK TO:

				LOIS
		No! The color's wrong!

				CAT
		More almond-shaped.

				STAN
		You said 'brown.'

				LOIS
		Not brown brown.  Not dull,
		insipid mud brown...
			(as Clark is leaning
			 next to her)
		... like Clark's.  No offense,
		Clark.

				CLARK
		Mud?

				LOIS
		More vibrant, more radiant.

				CAT
		Bedroom eyes.

	Jimmy has joined them.  In the b.g., by the coffee machine, 
	an office worker sets a full pot of coffee on the top warmer 
	and begins to make a second pot.  In doing so, she jostles 
	the machine and the pot on top slips to the edge.  She looks
	for a new filter, can't find one, digs in the cabinet below.

				JIMMY
		But if he is an alien, maybe he 
		doesn't get the old ... you know, 
		itch.

				CAT
		One way to find out.

3	CONTINUED:						3

				LOIS
		A possible visitor from another
		planet arrives on Earth and all
		you can think of is hauling him 
		off to your lair and trying him
		out?

				CAT
		Test drive, Lois.  A couple hours
		behind the wheel, I'd know for 
		sure if we're talking import or
		domestic.

	Lois rolls her eyes, then notices what Stan is drawing.

				LOIS
		No!  The features are too coarse.
		Think noble.  Think ... Greek God.

				STAN
			(lost)
		Greek God?

				LOIS
		Let's take it a feature at a time.
		For example, the chin.  Square, 
		but not plain.  The chin of a man
		who stands for something.  And the
		nose.  Definite, but not
		overbearing.

	Stan's more confused than ever.  Clark's right next to him.
	He's watching the pot of hot coffee move nearer and nearer
	the edge as the office worker still searches for filters.
	Also, the electrician on the ladder strains to reach some-
	thing... the ladder wobbles.

				STAN
		Like Clark's?

				LOIS
			(disgusted)
		This is Superman we're talking
		about.  Not some Tom, Dick, or ...

				CLARK
			(annoyed)
		You know, he didn't seem that
		special to me.  Except for the
		flying and the uniform, he could
		have been any ordinary guy.

	Lois is fed up.  Doesn't anybody see it but her?  The pot
	begins to fall.  The ladder begins to topple.  Clark takes
	a step back so he's behind the group.  No one's watching
	him.

				LOIS
		Ordinary?  Give me a break.

	At SUPER SPEED Clark moves first to the coffee machine --
	catches the pot, settles it back on top -- next to the 
	ladder and steadies it.  He then grabs a donut off a
	tray and returns to his place unnoticed.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
			(to Stan)
		What we've got here is an example
		of human evolution: 'before and
		after.' Clark is the 'before.'
		Superman is the 'after.'

	She looks again at Clark:  donut in his mouth, tie askew,
	hair tousled, suit wrinkled from his back and forth trip.
	In the b.g., the office worker has found her filter.

				LOIS (Cont'.d)
		Make that:  way, way after.

	looks around the newsroom.  Clark's PHONE PINGS.  She sees

	Clark is toured by the landlord, FLOYD. Floyd is fiftyish,
	paunchy, suspicious by nature. The apartment is a disaster:
	stained walls, torn carpet, etc. It does have a small
	balcony suitable for flying exits and entrances. The
	building's ventilation system, located on the roof above,
	adds a dull WHUMP, WHUMP, WHU.MP as b.g. noise.

				FLOYD (Cont'd)
		Nice view.  You see out, no one

				CLARK

	Clark, dressed as Clark, holds the Superman suit on a hanger
	and stares at it.  From outside, the sound of an APPROACHING
	SIREN.  He looks toward the sound, hesitates, then takes the
	suit off the hanger, folds it up, tucks it away in his old
	suitcase, stows that in the corner of the closet, shuts the
	closet door.  The SIREN FADES in the distance.

					FADE OUT.
                         END OF ACT THREE

                             ACT FOUR

	FADE IN:


	CLOSE ON a large doodled "S."  PULL BACK TO Lois, staring at
	her drawing.  Nearby are Clark, Jimmy, Cat, others.  The
	general mood is somber.  Clark, especially, seems
	preoccupied, muted.

				CAT
			(satiric, re: Lois'
			 drawing)
		Penny for your thoughts.

				LOIS
			(almost angrily)
		Where is he?!  It's been three
		days.

				JIMMY
		Maybe whoever was after him
		scared him off.

				LOIS
		I refuse to believe that.
		Superman is no coward.  He
		wouldn't turn tail at the first
		sign of trouble.	*
	*
	Cat sits down next to Clark.	*

				CAT
		What's with you, Clark?  You look
		like you lost your best friend.

	This is very close to home.

				CLARK
		I...

	Cat takes his arm, leans in close.

				CAT
		What you need is a pick-me-up

	Clark disentangles himself.  The look on his face tells her
	otherwise.

				CAT (Cont'd)
		Or not.

				LOIS
			(to Jimmy)
		Didn't you have some idea for	*
		finding Superman?

				JIMMY
		Forget it. It's a zero. Like my
		life.

				LOIS
		Tell me anyway.

				JIMMY
			(reluctantly)
		I just thought: if Superman is an
		alien, and came here from another
		planet, he'd have some kind of
		space ship. Track the ship
		somehow, find Superman.

				LOIS
			(considering)
		Huh.

				JIMMY
		A zero. I told you.

				PERRY (O.S.)
		Olsen!


64	ACROSS PIT						64

	Perry holds up a large, large-mouthed bass, impressively
	mounted on a wooden shield.  Except, the front bracket has
	come loose: the fish dangles pathetically by its tail.


65	BACK TO						65

				JIMMY
			(resigned)
		Duty calls.

	He trashes his lunch scraps, heads for Perry's office.  Lois
	returns to her desk, thinking...  thinking...  decides: she
	quickly punches numbers on her phone. As he passes, Clark
	OVERHEARS...

				LOIS
		Operator, get me the EPRAD
		satellite tracking station in
		Fairbanks, Alaska

	Clark stops, angry.

65	CONTINUED:						65
				CLARK
			(to himself)
		Now Jimmy?  That's it.  That's the
		last straw.

	He turns to face off against Lois, but Perry appears, claps
	him on the shoulder and hands him a slip of paper.

				PERRY
		Third and Walnut. Drive-by
		shooting. Get down there now.

	Clark looks again at Lois, hunched over and speaking into
	her phone. No one's looking at him. At SUPER SPEED he
	draws something on a large sheet of paper. Back to NORMAL	*
	SPEED, he examines his handiwork.	*


65A	CLOSEUP - CLARK'S DRAWING			65A	*

	It's a map with streets, arrows, etc. In the center, "X"	*
	marks the spot of "Superman's Spaceship."*	*


65B	BACK TO SCENE					65B	*

	Returning to SUPER SPEED, Clark folds, envelopes, and ad-	*
	dresses it, drops it in his out basket, picks up his phone,	*
	dials. Back to NORMAL SPEED.	*

				CLARK
		Hi. This is Clark Kent in the
		newsroom. Could I get a messenger
		up here? Right. On my desk.
		Tonight. To Lois Lane's apartment.

	He hangs up, gathers his things, heads to the exit.

						CUT TO:



	Clark returns, mentally and emotionally. The newsroom
	is nearly deserters.  Lois sits at her desk, watching the news
	on TV with the sound off.  The news consists of one disaster
	after another.  She looks at Clark, correctly guesses his
	mood.

				LOIS
		Bad?

66   CONTINUED:						66
				CLARK
		A fifteen-year-old boy is in
		critical condition, his mother is
		in shock, and his little sister
		can't stop crying.  There were
		witnesses, but they're not
		talking.  The officer I talked to
		says they've had half a dozen
		like this in the last week alone.

				LOIS
			(sadly)
		Sounds like a job for Superman.

				CLARK
			(bitterly)
		Yeah.  That would have made it a
		truly great story, wouldn't it?

				LOIS
		Forget the story, Clark.  Metropolis
		needs Superman.

				CLARK
		You think he would have been able
		to stop this?

	Clark slaps his notebook.  On the TV: Footage of the after-
	math of a car crash.  Clark points to it.

				CLARK (Cont'd)
		Or that?

				LOIS
		No.  Even Superman can't be 
		everywhere at once.

	Her words are eerie echoes of Luthor's, and Clark reacts to
	them.

				CLARK
		Then what good is he?

				LOIS
		What he can't do... it doesn't
		matter.  It's the idea of Superman.
		Someone to believe in.  Someone to
		build a few hopes around.  Whatever
		he can do: it's enough.
			(beat)
		If I could only tell him that.
			(beat)
		I hope it's not too late.

66	CONTINUED: (2)					66

	Lois gets up to leave. Clark, who's been deeply touched by
	her words, calls after her.

				CLARK
		Lois!

				LOIS
			(waving him off)
		Not now, Clark.

	She steps into the elevator.

				CLARK
		If you get a package ...

	She's gone. Clark stares after her, then at his notes, then
	back at the elevator.

					CUT TO:


67	OMITTED						67



	At Clark's desk, Perry, Jimmy, Cat, others are gathered to
	congratulate Clark.

				PERRY
		Good work, Kent.

				CLARK
		Thank you, sir.


81	CLOSEUP - FRONT PACE - THAT MORNING'S EDITION			81

	Photo: as described.

	Headline reads: "Superman's Back." Beneath that:
	"Disaster Averted." The by-line: "Clark Kent."


82	BACK TO SCENE					82

				CLARK
		I was just in the right place at
		the right time.

				PERRY
		That's what being a good reporter's
		all about. Keep it up.
			(beat; to Jimmy)
		What's taking my fish so long?

				JIMMY	*
			(uncomfortable)	*
		Uh, on it, Chief.	*

	Perry leaves. Jimmy reads from Clark's article.	*

				JIMMY (Cont'd)
		'Let there be no mistake.
		 Metropolis is my home now. I'm
		 here to stay.'
			(looking up)
		That should make life interesting.

				CAT
		Yeah, but where's the story
		behind the story? Where's the
		juicy stuff? Where's the dirt?

				CLARK
			(looking straight
			 ahead, hiding a
			 smile)
		I think that's coming in right now.

	They all turn to look.  Lois Lane has entered the newsroom.
	She's filthy, mud-splattered, exhausted.  She carries a
	large, mud-streaked trashbag which she drops on her desk.
	Everyone stares at her.

				JIMMY
		Lois, what happened?

				LOIS
			(edge of hysteria)
		Nothing.  Nothing at all.  Oh,
		you're referring to my...
		appearance?  Well, after hours
		of tramping through mud, and filth,
		and frogs, and things, I have a
		perfect right to be a bit...
		disheveled.
			(building)
		By the way, did you know it's
		possible to get completely lost
		at the Metropolis Sewage
		Reclamation Facility?
			(losing it)
		And did you know that there are
		billions of mosquitos there? I
		do. I met them!

	She rips open her blouse to reveal an impressive collection
	of red bites.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
		Of course, my little trip to hell
		wasn't a total failure.  I did
		find this.

	She unwraps the trashbag:  a large, plastic Godzilla with
	a yellow "S" painted on its chest.  Jimmy breaks into a
	huge grin, looks at Clark, who manages to keep a straight
	face.  Suspicious, furious, Lois approaches Clark's desk
	and produces, now folded and stained, the map.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
		You wouldn't happen to know who
		sent me this, would you?

	Then, see spots the Morning Edition.  She slowly lifts it,
	scans, puts it down.  Her fury has drained away, replaced
	by a vast empty feeling.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
		You got the story? You?

				CLARK
		Yep.
			(beat)
		Consider this a life lesson, Lois.
		No charge.

				LOIS
			(beginning a slow
			 burn)
		Uh-huh.

	In the b.g., Jimmy picks up the Godzilla.

					CUT TO:



	Perry's working at his desk.  The door bursts open to admit
	... Jimmy Olsen.  He holds the large-mouthed bass, sans
	mount.

				PERRY
		Olsen!  This fish hasn't been
		redone.

	Jimmy drops the bass in the trash can.

				JIMMY
		No, Chief.  But I have.

	Jimmy slams the door on his way out.  Perry stares after
	him, then smiles.

				PERRY
		Good for you, kid.

					CUT TO:



	Clark is working at his computer.  Lois still hasn't
	changed or cleaned up, sits at her desk staring into
	space.  She looks over at Clark, gets up, heads towards
	him, stops at his desk.  He glances up, slowly stands up.
	The newsroom holds its collective breath.

				LOIS
		You set me up.

				CLARK
		Yes I did.

	Will she explode?  Crumble?  What?  To Clark's, and everyone
	else's surprise, she holds out her hand.

				LOIS
			(with utter
			 sincerity)
		You won.

				CLARK

		I didn't 'win.'

	Nevertheless, he shakes her hand.

				LOIS
		Yes you did.  You got the story,
		and you took me down a peg in the
		process.  I guess I deserved that.
			(beat)
		You worked hard, you've earned
		your success.

				CLARK
		Thanks, Lois.  That means a lot to
		me.

				LOIS
		I hope so.  Cherish this moment.
		Because, Clark?  You'll never
		experience it again.

	She turns on her heel, heads for the showers.

				CLARK
			(calling after her)
		Hey, Lois!  What have we got on
		for tomorrow?

	She stops, turns back,

				LOIS
		You're using that word again,
		Clark.  There is 'you', there is
		'I', there is no 'we'.

				CLARK
		Not yet.

				LOIS
		Not ever.

				CLARK
		We'll see.

				LOIS
		How long can you hold your breath?

	She leaves.  Clark smiles after her.
