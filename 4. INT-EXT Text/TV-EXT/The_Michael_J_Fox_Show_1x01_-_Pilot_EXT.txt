      On AMSTERDAM, random passersby recognize Mike as he walks 
      with Eve and Graham.  A CONSTRUCTION WORKER shouts out: 

                                      CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                    Mike Burnaby!  5 O'Clock news!  Love 
                    you, bro!

      Mike flashes his affable smile, then tries to connect with 
      Eve (typing on her phone) and Graham (playing a video game).  

                                    MIKE
                    What do you have first period, Eve?  
                    French, right?  Oui?  Non?  

      Eve ignores Mike, taking a photo of the street with her phone.

                                    EVE
                    I've got to Instagram this.

                                    MIKE
                    Of course.  What would the world do 
                    without an old-timey photo of a dirty 
                    hot dog bun?

                                    EVE
                    It's a metaphor.

                                    MIKE
                    For why we should've never given you 
                    a phone?

                                      GRAHAM
                          (amazed, re: video game)
                    My guy just can't be killed.  And 
                    his head is like, off.

                                    MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mike Burnaby!  World's greatest man.

      Mike turns, assuming it's another fan, to see HARRIS GREEN 
      (47, his friend and former boss) exiting BARNEY GREENGRASS.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  8.

                                    MIKE
                    Hey, Harris.  

                                      HARRIS
                          (re: kids on their phones)
                    Aren't you worried they're going to 
                    fall into a couple open manholes?

                                    MIKE
                    Then I don't have to pay for college.

                                      HARRIS
                          (mussing Graham's hair)
                    You're getting tall, Graham.  Like 
                      not-Mike's-son tall... I'm worried.  

                                    EVE
                          (off Mike's elbow prompt)
                    Hi, Harris.

                                      HARRIS
                    Evie.  
                          (re: her coveralls)
                    I see you're trying to bring all the
                    boys to the yard.

                                    EVE
                    Come on, this is cool.  And I can
                    also drive an ice road truck.

                                      HARRIS
                    I'll walk with you guys.  I've got to
                    get downtown.  There's a press
                      conference at ten.  The city's trying
                    to ban foot-long sandwiches now.

                                    MIKE
                    I saw that.  Do me a favor and don't
                    just show a bunch of obese pedestrians
                    with their faces blurred out.  It's
                    creepy.  Pull tape on the special we
                    did in '05.  That was journalism.

      THROUGH LINCOLN CENTER, Mike's still energized by work talk: 

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Know what else you've got to change? 
                    Susan's new sign-off.  "Find Your
                    Happy?"  Is she selling yoga retreats? 
                    We used to cover wars.

      A passing MUSICIAN carrying a violin case calls out:

                                      MUSICIAN
                    Mike Burnaby!  Miss you!  Keep fighting!  

      Mike smiles and puts up his dukes.  Eve rolls her eyes; this
      happens all the time when she's out with her dad.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  9.

                                      HARRIS
                    He's not the only one who misses 
                    you, Mike.  We all do.  You should 
                    come back to work.

                                    MIKE
                    Are you forgetting why I left?  
                    Remember the rolling chair thing?

                                      HARRIS
                    You're way better now.  Plus, I sprung 
                    for wheel locks.

                                    MIKE
                    I don't want a pity job.  We both 
                    know if I come back, NBC's going to 
                    milk it for ratings by showing me in 
                    slow motion with lame uplifting music.

                                      HARRIS
                    As long as I'm news director, that
                    will not happen.  Just think about
                    it.  We need you, Mike.  No one
                    watches the news anymore.  We got
                    beaten by Craft Wars last night. 
                    That's literally watching paint dry.

      Before Mike can respond, he's hugged by a FEMALE MTA WORKER.

                                    MTA WORKER
                    Mike Burnaby!  You're a brave man.

                                    EVE
                    Would a "brave man" set his grown 
                      daughter's curfew for 10:30?

                                    MTA WORKER
                          (glares at Eve, hands Mike paper)
                    Could you sign this?  My grandma has 
                      Parkinson's.

      EVE TALKING HEAD (EVE'S ROOM)

      Eve films herself in a messy, impulsively decorated room.

                                    EVE
                    Yes, my dad is a celebrity and people
                    love him, blah, blah, but why does
                    everyone have to stop and tell him
                    about another person who also has
                      Parkinson's?  Alcoholism is a disease. 
                    Do people go up to Joe Namath and
                    tell him about their crazy uncles?


      Annie and Leigh try out different looks with Leigh's hair. 

                                      LEIGH
                    I don't know, it feels like bangs 
                    are for heavy people.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  13.

                                      ANNIE
                    I have bangs.

                                      LEIGH
                    You're the exception that proves the 
                    rule.  Although this is always your 
                    biggest season, if I'm just being real.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL Mike observing this.  Eve's there, too, 
      filming everything with her iPhone camera.

                                    MIKE
                    This is why I have to stay home?  So 
                    you can babysit a haircut?

                                      ANNIE
                    I'm going for moral support.

      ANNIE TALKING HEAD (MIKE AND ANNIE'S ROOM)

                                      ANNIE
                    Some people escape by watching trashy 
                    reality shows.  I watch Leigh.  Same 
                    train wreck, but she's on every day 
                    of the week.


      Mike takes in the old building, unsure of what he's about to 
      do, until Harris hurries out.

                                      HARRIS
                    There he is!  
                          (giving Mike a big, dramatic hug)
                    Welcome home, my friend.

                                    MIKE
                    This is an exploratory meeting.

                                      HARRIS
                    Of course.  No one knows you're here.


      Annie and the kids enjoy donuts at a classic NYC coffee stand.  
      They can't eat fast enough; it's like they've been in prison.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  20.

                                      GRAHAM
                    Can we always eat breakfast here?

                                      ANNIE
                    If Dad starts going in early like 
                    this, probably.

                                    EVE
                          (sarcastic)
                    I'm really going to miss his "healthy 
                      scrambles."

                                    IAN
                    They're always over-salted.  
                          (mimes shaking salt)
                    He just shakes, and shakes.

                                    EVE
                    You're better than that.

                                    IAN
                    But he sure can scramble those eggs.

                                    EVE
                    There you go.

                                      ANNIE
                          (re: Ian drinking)
                    How can you chug hot coffee?

                                    IAN
                    How can I not?  I sleep in a baby's
                    bed!  I'm done, Mom.  I can't rethink
                      technology in a closet.  It's right
                    off the kitchen, the Legos are
                      distracting, and Eve's next door,
                    blasting her garbage music.

                                    EVE
                          (pointed)
                    You like Maroon 5.

                                    IAN
                    I like Adam Levine!  He's just got 
                    it.  He does.  End of story.
                          (then, back on Annie)
                    Either make Graham give me my old 
                    room back or let me take over your 
                    crafting room.

                                      ANNIE
                    But where would I craft?

      ANNIE TALKING HEAD (CRAFTING ROOM)

      Annie talks to camera in the well-stocked, medium-sized room.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  21.

                                      ANNIE
                    Every woman loves to craft.  In the
                    nine years I've had this room, I've
                    never actually made anything, but
                    just the idea of having it mellows
                    me out. 
                          (looks around)
                    Look at all this stuff.  If I actually 
                    liked to craft, I could make anything.


                                    IAN
                    When was the last time you crafted?

                                      ANNIE
                    My hobbies are not on trial here. 
                    You decided to drop out.  When you
                    left for college, which we paid for,
                    you renounced all habitation rights. 
                    As a child who actually belongs in
                    the apartment, Graham has dibs.

                                    IAN
                          (a beat, to Graham)
                    I'll make you a 10% shareholder.

                                      GRAHAM
                    In what?

                                    IAN
                    My company.  YouSearch.  "Searching 
                    at the Speed of You."

                                      GRAHAM
                          (sweetly)
                    No thanks.

                                    IAN
                    Fine.  I'm off to work at the public 
                    library, like a drifter.

                                    EVE
                          (as Ian stalks off, to Annie)
                    It's always something with him, right?

                                      ANNIE
                    What about you?  I heard you signed-
                    out a TV for your presentation today.  
                    What sort of bullshit project did you 
                    talk Mr. Diaz into letting you do?

                                    EVE
                    Whatever happened to teacher/student 
                      confidentiality?

                                      ANNIE
                    That's not a thing.  It'll never be 
                    a thing.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  22.


      Eve and Ian drop water-filled condoms off their building.   

                                    EVE
                    Why do we have to use these?

                                    IAN
                      I couldn't find any regular balloons.  
                    And they give these out like candy 
                    in college.  Getting 500 free condoms 
                    isn't preventative, it's pressure.  

                                    EVE
                          (drops condom)

                    They did once.  When we were away at 
                    camp... Graham?

                                    EVE
                    Ew!  Can you imagine their skin?  
                    Are they just dressed in their clothes 
                    and then they like, start?

      As they keep dropping water condoms, Eve lets down her guard:

                                    EVE (CONT'D)
                    Diaz failed me.  For that video.

                                    IAN
                    Really?      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  26.

                                    EVE
                    It's not my first F, but this one 
                    kind of hurt.  He basically called 
                    me a phony.

                                    IAN
                      A "phony?"  Who are you, Holden 
                    Caufield?

                                    EVE
                    I know that's a Catcher in the Rye 
                      reference, but I only read the wiki 
                    summary.

                                    IAN
                    Ask Diaz for an incomplete.  Tell
                    him you want to prove him wrong --
                    he loves that crap -- then keep
                    working on it until you're proud of
                    what you've got.

                                    EVE
                    Okay, but then I'd have to film you 
                    a lot more...

                                    IAN
                    Take the F.
                          (re: another condom drop)
                    Right on a guy's soft pretzel.  You 
                    could tell he was going to enjoy that.

                                    EVE
                          (regards Ian for a beat)
                    Why am I talking to you about this?  
                    You're Mr. Perfect.

                                    IAN
                    That's where you're wrong.  Rebooting 
                    the search engine isn't the only 
                    reason why I'm back here.  

                                    EVE
                    I've got to start using that.  How 
                    do I find YouSearch again?

                                    IAN
                          (a beat, small)
                    Google it.

                                    EVE
                    Wait.  To get to your search engine 
                    you have to use another search engine--

                    I failed an Econ class last semester.  
                    It was graded on a curve and 
                      apparently everyone at college is 
                    smarter than me.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  27.

                                    EVE
                    But that's just one class--

                                    IAN
                    A curve is a mathematic formula 
                    designed to separate the very best 
                    from the people who used to be the 
                    best.  That's me now.

                                    EVE
                    Okay, but coming home?  Isn't that a 
                    little drastic?

                                    IAN
                    I'm a drastic person.

                    Nailed an old lady.  

                                    EVE
                    No, that's Aunt Leigh.

      Eve and Ian share a look, then race back inside.


      A driven Mike hurries past an unexploded water-filled condom, 
      a little unnerved, as he talks on his cell phone.

                                    MIKE
                    Kay, it's Mike.  I'm back in.

                                    KAY (ON PHONE)
                    What?

                                                                          INTERCUT WITH:


      The fire is finally out.  Firemen clean up and help the family 
      sort through belongings.  Mike is on his cell phone:

                                    MIKE
                    We just wrapped.  Got some killer B
                    roll of the family looking through
                    burnt photo albums, too.  And the
                    Dad's got their kitten on his
                    shoulder, so look out Craft Wars.

                                                                          INTERCUT WITH:      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  30.


      MUSIC BEGINS and Eve's talking head BRIDGES THE CUT as Mike 
      walks with Annie and Eve.

                                    MIKE
                    Why don't we grab breakfast?

                                    EVE
                    Nah, I've got to shower before school. 

                                      ANNIE
                    And I have papers to grade.

      As Annie and Eve lead Mike back home: 

                                    MIKE
                    Huh.  I guess you really can't control 
                      everything.   

                                    EVE  (V.O.)
                    Of course he's not the same person 
                    he used to be.  With everything that's 
                    happened, how could he be?


      Mike, Annie and Eve arrive back home.  As Mike opens the 
      front door, Eve jumps in front of him and rushes inside.

                                    EVE
                    Wait!  Stay here.

      Eve slams the door closed and we hear sounds of PLATES 
      CLANGING and ARGUING inside.  Mike looks at Annie; she shrugs. 

                                    EVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Okay!

      Mike and Annie enter and walk through the foyer to find Eve, 
      Ian and Graham sitting around the dining room table.  In 
      front of them is a huge homemade breakfast.  Leigh rushes in 
      with a platter of sausages and sits, too.  Then:      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  35.

                                    KIDS AND LEIGH
                    Surprise!

      A beat as Mike processes what they're doing.

                                      GRAHAM
                    Sit down meal.  
                          (then, smiling)
                    Sit down, Dad.

      Mike smiles, touched.  He looks to Annie--

                                      ANNIE
                    Their idea.  

                                    EVE (V.O.)
                    The truth is, none of us are the 
                    same.  And we're still changing.  

                                    IAN
                    These are the idea of waffles more 
                    than actual waffles.  Sorry.

      Mike and Annie sit down, joining the others.

                                    EVE (V.O.)
                    But through it all, my dad has never 
                    stopped trying, never stopped being 
                    here -- a part of this family.  And 
                    that's what makes him amazing.

                                    MIKE
                    This is great, guys.  Thanks.  Who 
                    wants some eggs?

      As Mike reaches for a spoon and struggles to spoon eggs onto 
      his children's plates, the MUSIC CUTS OUT.

                                      ANNIE
                    Can you not have a personal victory 
                    right now?  We're starving.

      Annie grabs the spoon from Mike and takes over.  

                                      LEIGH
                    Yeah, and I'm having coffee with a 
                      skateboarder in a few, so... chop 
                    chop.

      Graham notices Annie's centerpiece on the table.

                                      GRAHAM
                    Somebody move that.  It's scaring me.

      As everyone enjoys sit-down breakfast, we PULL BACK AND OUT.

                                  END OF ACT THREE      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  36.

                                          TAG


      Mike, Eve and Graham walk past BARNEY GREENGRASS.  Harris 
      sits at a table in the window.  CHYRON: "Six Months Earlier".

                                    EVE
                    Let's grab some bagels.

                                    MIKE
                    Why?  You just had a healthy scramble.

      Mike continues on.  Eve and Harris share a frustrated look.

      - ANOTHER DAY, same walk.  CHYRON: "Four Months Earlier".  
      They pass right by Harris, but Mike is too busy texting.

                                    EVE
                    Can you put that down for one second?

                                    MIKE
                          (as he texts, continuing on)
                    Nope.  Graham taught me emoticons.  
                    "Crying face, winking face, pineapple, 
                      saxophone."  Just sent you that.

      - ANOTHER DAY, same walk.  CHYRON: "Two Months Earlier".

                                    EVE
                    Fresh Nova?  For just $7.99 a pound?

      As Eve physically moves Mike to look at Harris, a BIKE 
      MESSENGER screeches to a halt right in front of them.

                                    BIKE MESSENGER
                    Mike Burnaby!  The man, the myth!

      - ANOTHER DAY, same walk, only Annie's there, too.  CHYRON: 
      "Last Week".  Annie pulls Mike toward Barney Greengrass.

                                      ANNIE
                    Hey, look, it's Harris Green.  Let's 
                    go say hello to him right now.

                                    MIKE
                    You're hurting my arm.  Slow down.

      They head inside to find Harris sitting at his usual table, 
      only he's busy talking to a HOT WOMAN sitting next to him.  

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Harris.

                                      HARRIS
                    Not now.  I'll get with you later.

      Harris turns back to the woman and keeps hitting on her.  As 
      the family glares at Harris, Mike shrugs and heads out.
