  GEORGIA AND JO WALK HOME.  GEORGIA'S STILL DOWNCAST AND 
    PREOCCUPIED.

                                  JO

                Are you okay?  (NO RESPONSE)  Come on, 

                you haven't said a word for eight blocks.  

                Does someone need a little cheering up?  

                (SEEING A CART)  Oo-ooh, roasted 

                  pistachios.  Just the smell of them is 

                making my lips swell, but I know they're 

                your favorite.

                                  JO

                Do you need to go buy some shoes?  

                Handbag?  (WITH RELISH)  Estate jewelry?

                                    GEORGIA

                Leave me alone.

  THEY WALK IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT.  THEN JO NOTICES SOMETHING.

                Oh, look.  Big line outside the Virgin 

                  Megastore.  Sign says Vanessa Williams is 

                signing Ugly Betty DVDs.  I'll bet 

                there's a few gay men in that line.  Oh,

  GEORGIA LOOKS UP.  A LIGHT COMES INTO HER EYES.  THE GIRLS CLASP 
  HANDS AND RUN OFF.

                Ahh, that was just what I needed.  Thank 

                you so much.  You always know what to do 

                for me.

                                  JO

                So you're okay now?

                                    GEORGIA

                I'm getting there.  Just... the way that 

                casting director talked to me...  But I'm 

                not giving up.  This isn't over.

  THEY STOP AT A CROSSWALK.  NEARBY IS A FIFTYISH PROFESSORIAL 
  TYPE IN A TWEED JACKET.  SEEING HIM, JO'S EYES GO WIDE.  SHE 
  HIDES HER FACE AND TRIES TO EDGE AWAY.  GEORGIA NOTICES.

                Nothing.  Can we walk home a different
