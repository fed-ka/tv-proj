A burning white sun high in a clear blue sky,
PAN DOWN TO:
A rundown (sixties) airport, peeling in the heat.
A mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint
where a RWANDAN POLICEMAN blows his whistle, waves some and stops
others as bored Rwandan soldiers look on.
CLOSE ON: A white van pulls out of traffic, a balls-out case of line
jumping. HORNS, OBSCENITIES.
A HAND: Extends from the passenger side of the van, Rwandan francs
pressed neatly between thumb and palm.
The van stops next to the policeman.
POLICEMAN
Mr. Rusesabagina, good morning.
In the passenger seat PAUL RUSESABAGINA, late 30's, flashes a smile. He
is dressed in a sharp blue suit (always dressed in a neat suit and tie,
it is a matter of pride).
A quick shake of hands. Money passes from one to the other.
The van parked by the runway tarmac. African music plays on the radio.
Paul drums his fingers, checks his watch.
ZOZO, porter/driver, early thirties, sits nervously.
An airport baggage handler approaches the van.
HANDLER
Sir, the flight is delayed one more hour.
PAUL
Thank you.
(to Zozo)
He can get the beer.
2.
ZOZO
(suddenly worried)
Rutaganda's place?
PAUL
What's wrong?
ZOZO
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You
are safe there.
PAUL
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Zozo throws the van into gear and speeds off.
The white van, marked "THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES," whips its way through
Kigali's packed streets and open-air markets.
ZXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY
Zozo works THE HORN, weaves in and out of traffic.
ZOZO
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
PAUL
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach
it is like the bus to Giterama.
ZOZO
That is why they call it coach?
PAUL
Maybe. But in business class there are
fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
ZOZO
(impressed)
You have taken business class?
PAUL
Many times.
Suddenly, Zozo slows.
Paul looks up, SEES: a gathering on the side of the road -- a large
crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts.
They're members of the INTERAHAMWE - the Hutu Militia.
3.
(Interahamwe - the Hutu Militia will de distinguished by these wildly
colored shirts) They chant, drink beer, dance onto the road,
obstructing cars, threatening the occupants. Several of them perform a
rhythmic dance - the INTERAHAMWE war dance to thumping drumbeat music
from a boombox.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Turn off.
Zozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind.
ZOZO
There is nowhere to turn, sir.
As the van approaches,
PAUL
Slow down.
The van pulls up beside the Militia.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Boys, do you know the way to Mr.
Rutagunda's warehouse?
Some Militia approach. They are suddenly friendly, helpful.
MILITIA MAN #1
It is one more mile on this road.
Paul reaches into his pocket, takes out some Rwandan dollars.
PAUL
This is thirsty work, let me treat you to
some beers.
As the van pulls away Zozo looks to Paul, relieved.
A Sabena airliner lands. Passengers disembark via a roll-up staircase.
Paul's van pulls up by the luggage belt.
A large polystyrene box comes down the conveyor belt. It has Brussels -
Kigali destination stickers all over it.
As Zozo picks it up, water sloshes from the lid.
PAUL
The ice has melted!
Zozo goes to open it.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Don't. Let's go.
Paul slips money to two customs officials.
The van speeds through traffic. More traffic jams, Zozo edges up on the
sidewalk. Then at an intersection they see.
THE INTERAHAMWE PARADE - a mass of young men and women, most in the
same colorful uniform. Line after line, waves all performing the
INTERAHAMWE war dance, in wild hypnotic sync, many wave sticks, spears,
wooden imitation guns. A large banner reads, "Hutu Power."
A flatbed truck, speakers blare drumbeat music. On it GEORGE RUTAGUNDA
dances the DANCE and waves a machete to the crowd.
Zozo sinks down behind the wheel.
PAUL
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract
attention to yourself.
ZOZO
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors,
they know I'm Tutsi.
The parade passes. As they wait Paul takes out the wad of notes George
gave him, peels off a few dollars.
P
PAUL
Here, Zozo, for your trouble.
Zozo takes it.
6.
The van turns off the street into The Milles Collines Hotel driveway
and HONKS twice as it pulls down a short drive lined with tall shrubs.
An ARMED GUARD rushes from his booth and lifts the gate. Perfectly
timed. The van doesn't even have to slow as it passes. A sign on the
guard house reads "WELCOME TO THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES".
Lush tropical gardens, peacocks wander the well-manicured lawns,an
exotic African paradise. The van heads to a magnificent colonial
building.
PAUL (V.O.)
Pull up at the front door.
A valet opens the front door of the hotel and looks shocked. It's
unheard of for a service van to stop out front.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(urgent, to the valet)
Help Zozo.
It is night now. Floodlights bathe the hotel in a warm glow. Tiki oil
lamps illuminate the walkways and spread scented citronella smoke among
the trees. Wild birds CALL OUT.
Paul walks to the employee car park at the rear.
He sees Gregoire and another male reception clerk tossing Zozo's
pillbox porter's hat between them with Zozo trapped in the middle
trying to jump and catch it. Gregoire thinks this tease is great fun.
13.
GREGOIRE
Come on, Zozo, cockroaches can jump, some
of them can fly.
he clerk sees Paul just as he's about to throw, miscalculates, the hat
sails over Gregoire's head and lands at Paul's feet. Zozo scampers to
pick it up.
PAUL
No.
(points to Gregoire)
You pick it up.
Gregoire doesn't move.
PAUL (CONT'D)
How are your dish-washing skills,
Gregoire?
Gregoire bends, picks up the hat, hands it to Zozo, who walks away
quickly. Gregoire and his friend turn to head back into the hotel.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in
this hotel, do you understand?
BIK (O.S.)
Cockroaches?
Bik has walked out of the rear door and overheard.
BIK (CONT'D)
Don't tell me we have cockroaches, Paul?
A sly smile breaks on Gregoire's face as he uses Bik's arrival to
disappear inside.
PAUL
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
BIK
That's what I came to talk to you about.
PAUL
Excuse me?
BIK
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to
say they would be here on the sixth for
the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the
banquet room for that day, a reception to
broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you
organize monitors and check the satellite
dish?
14.
PAUL
Leave it to me.
Bik leans slightly closer.
BIK
Also, could you remember to use the
service entrance at all times?
PAUL
Of course.
Paul hops in his car and tosses a box of Belgium chocolates on the seat
next to him.
Paul speeds through the streets of Kigali HUMMING along to music on the
radio and eating chocolates from the box. He passes bicycles laden
with produce. The song on the radio ends and local news comes on.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Good Hutus of Rwanda, beware. The
dictatorship of the Tutsi cockroach is
near. Watch your neighbor. Identify these
cockroaches. Then rise up and stamp out
this murderous infestation...
Paul turns the station.
Finds another with music.
Lights burn in windows. Kids play soccer in dusty lots. Paul's van
turns onto a residential street and slows. He HONKS twice. The metal
gate to a walled compound swings open. A GUARD(old, peaked hat, bare
feet, pathetic) stands just inside. Paul waves to him and pullsinto
the courtyard, two cars are already parked there.
A neat bungalow and gardens behind the high wall. Paul parks and gets
out. A DOG runs and greets him, BARKING.
PAUL
Down, Pealiss.
15.
His wife, TATIANA, a woman of great natural beauty, emerges from the
house, beside her an even taller, very elegant woman, she has a
doctor's bag and a stethoscope in her hand. This is ODETTE, their
family doctor and close friend.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this
time?
TATIANA
I asked Odette to take a look at little
Anais. She has a rash.
PAUL
Your brother's here?
TATIANA
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
e wants some advice.
ODETTE
Good to see you, Paul.
Paul embraces Odette warmly, kisses Tatiana.
ODETTE (CONT'D)
I must go, Paul.
TATIANA
You will not stay for dinner.
ODETTE
No thank you, Tatiana.
PAUL
My best to Jean Baptiste.
EXT: PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
The old guard opens the gate, Odette drives off.
PAUL
(a sigh)
Thomas wants advice?
TATIANA
He wants your wisdom.
PAUL
Let's have dinner first.
16.
TATIANA
Of course.
His brother-in-law THOMAS and sister-in-law FEDENS come out to greet
Paul the Patriarch. They hug. Kids run everywhere. Paul spots his twin
nieces Anais (in blue) and Carine (in yellow), four years old. He
scoops them up, one in each arm.
PAUL
Hello, Anais.
She laughs.
CARINE
I am Carine.
PAUL
You are not Anais?
ANAIS
I am Anais.
PAUL
Oh, Carine, that is a shame. I have a
present for Anais.
Anais reaches out her hand. Paul sets them on the ground, takes a
chocolate from his chocolate box, deliberately hands it to Carine.
Anais jumps up and down.
ANAIS
It is for me.
PAUL
Goodness, I cannot tell. I guess I must
find another present.
He takes a chocolate gives it to Carine, then hands out the
chocolates
to his children who are gathered around.
Roger runs to a wooden fence, gets down, moves two boards and squeezes
through into a path, almost a tunnel in dense reeds.
Roger crawls along his path. There's a gap a little way down, and Roger
shoots through it into the wide open of the neighbors yard. He runs to
a back window of the house and taps on it. Soon SIMON, 12, appears. He
slides it open.
ROGER
Let's feed it.
18.
Simon lets Roger in.
Roger crawls along his grass tunnel. Then he hears something. He looks
through the reeds toward the street.
HE SEES: Military boots, a cluster of Hutu soldiers in their crisp
Khaki uniforms.
He hears whispering.
OLDIER'S VOICE (O.S.)
That house.
Paul, Tatiana, are by Thomas's car. They say good night to their
guests. Anais and Carine sleep in the car.
Paul nods to the old guard to go open the gate. Just then Roger emerges
from the thicket, wide-eyed, afraid.
ROGER
There are soldiers.
PAUL
Where?
ROGER
On the street.
Paul nods to Tatiana to take Roger inside. Thomas and Fedens grab the
sleeping twins from their car.
Paul goes to his big metal gates and peers through the two inch gap
E
between the gate hinge and the gate post.
HE SEES: (two houses down) the group of Hutu soldiers, clustered around
jeeps, they whisper and point. It's a raid.
20.
Now they move rushing out of view.
The sounds of SPLINTERING WOOD, GLASS BREAKING, CHILDREN'S CRIES, WOMEN
SCREAMING.
Suddenly there's a face, beside Paul's. It's Tatiana.
TATIANA
What is it?
She looks, sees the soldiers, as they drag a middle-aged man onto the
street.
He is crying, pleading, like a whipped dog.
TATIANA (CONT'D)
Oh, my God, it's Victor. Why do they want
Victor?
They watch as Victor is beaten to the jeep. At this point Victor looses
it completely, stops pleading, grabs on to a soldier, clinging,
screaming like a terrified child - like a man who knows he is going to
die. It's a horror.
TATIANA (CONT'D)
Do something.
PAUL
What?
TATIANA
Call your friends in the army. Call
someone. Victor is harmless. This is a
mistake.
PAUL
Please, be quiet.
Tatiana, moves toward the gate handle.
TATIANA
I'm going to talk to them.
Paul grabs her.
PAUL
No.
TATIANA
We must do something.
Paul takes her by the arm, leads her to the house.
21.
PAUL
What would you have us do? Argue with
these madmen? We cannot interfere.
Paul's car rolls up to the hotel's guard house.
SUPER THE TITLE: APRIL 6th, 1994.
An army jeep is parked just inside. General Bizimungu is in the
passenger seat, talking into a walkie-talkie.
The General gives an I'll see you soon wave.
The hotel entrance is a mini-jam of airport buses, white UN jeeps,
foreign news crew Land Rovers, and a TV repair van unloading monitors.
Paul marches in, past Zozo the bell hop, who helps the TV men unload.
PAUL
Welcome, gentlemen.
General Bizimungu, briefcase in hand, gives the tv interview, He's
confident, controlled Benedict stands close by as Gloria interviews.
GLORIA
There are rumors, General, that your
army, the Hutu army, consider these peace
accords a sellout to the Tutsi rebels.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
(laughs)
Nonsense. At this moment we are making
plans to rehabilitate the dissidents into
our armed forces.
GLORIA
Then the army fully supports the
president as he signs the peace
agreement.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Of course, the president is a clever man,
he knows what he is doing. Thank you for
coming to Rwanda. (on the move). You will
see what a beautiful country this is.
Paul emerges, discovers Fedens and Thomas - they look embarrassed to be
in such exulted surroundings.
THOMAS
Forgive us, Paul. We must talk.
PAUL
What's wrong?
THOMAS
We are leaving Rwanda, Paul.
PAUL
Go to the terrace, I will join you.
CUT TO
Drinks are served at a table as Paul listens to Thomas.
THOMAS
My assistant, the Hutu Power man, says we
should get out now, that soon it will be
very bad.
Paul stifles his anger.
PAUL
Give me this man's name.
THOMAS
His name is Naramaranga, but please,
Paul, even though he is Hutu Power, he is
a friend, he likes me. He told me there
is a signal. It is "Cut the tall trees."
When they hear the signal, the militia
are to go to war.
FEDENS
Please, let us take Tatiana with us. You
are Hutu, you will be safe.
PAUL
Thomas, Fedens, I am a man who looks
after his family. If there were danger I
would be the first to leave?
BANG - a distant explosion, a flash of light on the far side of the
city. Fedens jumps.
30.
FEDENS
What was that?
PAUL
Calm yourself, it is fireworks to
celebrate the peace.
THOMAS
Please, Paul, tomorrow I will bring you
my car. You will sell it for me and get a
fair price. We will go to Tanzania until
there is real peace.
ZOZO
Excuse me, Paul, you have a call.
Zozo hands Paul a cordless phone.
PAUL
ello. Tatsi. Yes, they are here. Yes. I
know but I want them to calm down.
THOMAS and Fedens listen.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Already the press are packing their bags.
The BBC man told me there's no story
here. We are boring now. I'll be home
soon.
He hangs up.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Let us all go home and sleep.
Paul escorts Fedens and Thomas to their car.
PAUL
Call when you get home.
And don't worry,
Thomas. Good night.
Paul turns onto his street. The houses are dark: windows shuttered;
gates closed; not a soul about. Paul stops before his gate. HONKS
twice. The gate doesn't open. He hops out and opens it with a key.
Gives it a push and pauses as he heads back to the car. He hears the
far off sound of gunfire. Distant explosions light the night sky.
Paul drives in. His compound is curiously dark.
His headlights sweep
across his pitch-black house.
UT TO:
The gates swing shut. We PULL BACK as Paul turns and faces his house.
Paul whistles for the dog, nothing. He goes back to the car, gets a
flashlight, heads for the front door.
Roger crawls between the shrubs.
He hears ANGRY VOICES.
He peers through the long grass.
Sees: Hutu soldiers boots, feet in sneakers, bare women's feet. And
among them the glint of machetes, hoes, a club spiked with nails, a
length of chain CLANGING on the ground.
Tatiana rushes out the front door, Paul after her.
Paul catches her and puts his hand over her mouth.
PAUL
Shhhhh.
SHOUTS next door. Paul pulls Tatiana behind the car. A beat. More
SHOUTS. Paul takes his hand from her mouth. She's sobbing.
E
Roger crawls to the gap in the shrubs. Feet, a crowd, leaving, through
a gate. Engines rev.
Roger crawls from the bushes.
Crawls across, the driveway, crawls through a puddle.
Then stops, SEES SOMETHING, AN (UNSEEN) HORROR!
Paul and Tatiana exit the back of the house with flashlight in hand
headed towards the rear gate.
Paul searches along the chain link fence, finds a section loose, he
pulls it back, clambers underneath it.
Tatiana clasps her mouth, afraid to utter a cry.
Paul crawls through this scrub tunnel.
35.
Then he hears BRANCHES SNAPPING.
He moves toward the sound.
Discovers Roger, terrified, thrashing in a tangle of bushes.
He grabs Rogers shirt, pulls him as the little boy startles.
PAUL
Ssshh!
Paul drags his son through the chainlink fence, whisks him up in his
arms and rushes him to the house.
The faintest grey of dawn over the city. Then a flock of birds rises as
one in the distance. A millisecond later, the cause of their flight, a
grenade explosion, echoes.
The birds dart, in another direction as the STACCATO of a machine gun
rips the air.
The Captain stops by his jeep, studies his clipboard.
Tatiana with Roger in her arms, her kids and all the neighbors herded
together.
PAUL
What is this about?
CAPTAIN
Let me see your identity card.
Paul pulls it from his pocket, hands it to the Captain.
CLOSE ON: Paul's ID - it reads Ethnicity: HUTU.
The Captain studies him, waves for the soldiers to back off.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered
our president.
PAUL
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
CAPTAIN
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
PAUL
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
39.
The Captain looks confused. Paul quickly:
PAUL (CONT'D)
I used to work at the Diplomat.
CAPTAIN
Do you know how to open the safe there?
(Paul nods)
Our government needs to use the hotel and
the room keys are in the safe. You must
open it.
PAUL
Of course.
Paul sees out into the street behind the jeeps: a group of Militia in
their colored shirts armed with machetes, have gathered, trying to see
what is going on.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Captain, I must take my family.
It is not safe here.
CAPTAIN
Where is your family?
Tatiana is beside him now.
TATIANA
(interrupts)
This is them.
Tatiana points to the huddled neighbors. Paul is stunned.
CAPTAIN
All of them! I cannot take them.
TATIANA
No, no, good Captain, you do not have to.
We have the car and our van.
She points to the Mille Collines van.
he Captain looks doubtful, then his two-way radio barks - an urgent
message. He listens.
Tatiana drags the kids and ushers everyone toward the van. In a second,
they are all clambering in.
CAPTAIN
Let's go.
40.
Paul jumps behind the wheel of the van. Neighbors are jammed in like
sardines, 15, more, inside. Tatiana and their kids are squashed
together on the front bench.
The convoy (jeep - van, car - jeep) starts up and turns out into the
street.
The Militia men wave sticks, machetes.
The convoy speeds through the deserted streets. Slowing only to
maneuver through makeshift roadblocks where Militia wave machetes,
nailed clubs and spears as they dance.
FURTHER ALONG THE ROAD: a group of Militia swarm over a car, smashing
the windshield, the windows. Inside a family huddles together in
terror, waiting for the windows to give way.
In the gutter by the side of the road, three dead bodies.
PAUL
(to Tatiana)
Don't look.
The convoy pulls up at this older, shabbier hotel. There are other
jeeps, and several staff in a panic. The janitor, ROBERT, sees Paul,
bursts into waves of joy.
ROBERT
Mr. Paul, sir. Oh, Mr. Paul. We must open
every door right now for the government.
Paul jumps out of the van, hurries to the lead jeep.
PAUL
(to the Captain)
The safe is in the manager's office.
41.
The Captain nods to two soldiers.
CAPTAIN
Go with him, get the keys.
Paul emerges to see:
All of the occupants of the van, Tatiana, his kids, Odette on their
knees, with their hands on their heads.
The Captain hovers over them, pistol in hand, turns, sees Paul. He
marches toward him and SLAPS HIM HARD on the face.
CAPTAIN
Traitor!
Paul reels from the blow, but manages to stay on his feet.
The Captain snatches a bunch of ID cards from a soldier, hurls the
cards in Paul's face.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
PAUL
Let me explain.
He grabs Paul by the scruff of the neck, pushes him toward the kneeling
captives. The Captain snatches a pistol from one of his soldiers,
shoves it into Paul's hand.
CAPTAIN
SHOOT THEM!
Paul looks at him.
PAUL
Please, I don't use guns.
CAPTAIN
There is nothing to it.
The Captain raises his own pistol and FIRES it. Everyone jumps with
fright.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
Shoot them now or you die first.
The Captain aims his pistol at Paul's head. Cocks the hammer.
43.
PAUL
Captain, what could I pay you not to do
this?
The Captain laughs.
CAPTAIN
You want to pay me?
PAUL
Why not? These are not rebels, look at
them. Soon they will be worthless to you.
Why not take some money, for your work?
CAPTAIN
How much?
PAUL
Name a price.
CAPTAIN
Ten thousand francs for each one.
PAUL
I don't have that much.
The Captain laughs, snatches the gun from Paul, marches toward them.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Wait! Wait!
Paul reaches into his pocket, pulls out the bunch of dollars.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty
thousand francs for my family. To let us
drive off to the Mille Collines.
CAPTAIN
How many in your family?
PAUL
Six.
The Captain looks at his soldiers, at the wad of notes.
APTAIN
Pull your family out.
Paul runs over, grabs Tatiana, Roger, the three girls. Odette kneels
beside Tatiana. Paul whispers.
PAUL
Have you any money?
44.
ODETTE
Nothing.
Paul pushes his family toward the van, looks back, sees the Captain
pocket the dollars, move toward the line.
TATIANA
Paul, don't let them die.
PAUL
(urgent)
Get in.
Paul pushes them into the van, shuts the door, digs into his soul for
all the courage he can muster, then turns back.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Captain, let these people give you some
money, whatever they have.
The Captain hesitates. Paul sees this, runs over to the line of
neighbors.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Give me everything, everything you have.
A pathetic rain of Rwandan francs, useless coins, watches, jewelry
falls onto the ground. Paul scoops it all up.
T
he Captain looks at it, takes it, then:
CAPTAIN
There is only enough for one cockroach.
The Captain raises his pistol.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
Pick one to take with you.
Now each terrified neighbor looks to Paul, begging.
PAUL
Wait, wait.
Paul counts the kneeling figures: ten adults, four kids.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Ten.
CAPTAIN
And four children?
45.
PAUL
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs
for all of them.
The Captain points the gun.
CAPTAIN
Give me it.
PAUL
I don't have it here. At the Mille
Collines. I can get it for you.
CAPTAIN
You will run into the hotel and hide
behind the U.N.
PAUL
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand
francs, enough for a house. I will get
the money, you keep them outside.
The Captain smiles.
CAPTAIN
I will keep your family outside. Let's
go.
The convoy pulls up at the outer gates of the Mille Collines. It's
manned by ARMED UN PEACEKEEPERS.
he Captain walks to Paul in the van.
CAPTAIN
Go with my soldiers. And hurry back if
you want to keep these cockroaches.
The Captain nods to Paul's children.
Paul jumps into the Rwandan army jeep.
PAUL
(to UN Peacekeepers)
I am the manager. Open the gate.
Chaos - UN jeeps, hotel vans, dismayed tourists, frightened Tutsi
refugees.
46.
CLOSE ON: Bik, the Dutch manager, bag packed, anxious, sees Paul.
YELLS.
BIK
Paul, I have to talk to you ...
But Paul ignores Bik, barrels his way through the din and crush of the
parking lot.
Paul pushes through the mob at the door. Bik comes up.
BIK
Paul...
grabs Paul)
...I have to talk to you.
PAUL
I'll be back.
Paul breaks free and hurries over to the Army jeep.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(hops in)
Let's go.
Paul jumps from the jeep. Waves to Tatiana in the van, then gives the
money to the Captain.
47.
PAUL
Now let them go.
No response. Money in hand, the Captain eyes Paul with malice.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Don't be foolish. There's more money to
be made here.
CAPTAIN
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask
for Captain Naramunju.
The Captain smiles, then jumps in his jeep and speeds off. Paul runs to
the van and jumps in.
INSIDE THE VAN
Jubilation, in the rear of the van. Odette is in tears.
ODETTE
Thank you, thank you, Paul.
Paul doesn't reply. Tatiana hugs him. He gives her a look - a mix of
relief and anger - the crowd in the back almost cost him his family.
Paul's van arrives. Bik hangs from a minibus.
BIK
(shouts)
Paul, I have to go. The staff have fled
Kivu Lodge. I have to close it.
He flings office keys to Paul.
BIK (CONT'D)
While I'm away, you're in charge.
Bik's van takes off. A group of tourists hears Bik's words.
TOURISTS
Hey, hey, we need our passports, we want
to get a flight.
Paul looks at them.
TOURIST
They're in your safety boxes. We need
them right away.
48.
PAUL
Come inside.
Paul waits, then a car pulls up, an Indian businessman, Mr. Garindi,
gets out, shakes hands, he's shaken.
MR. GARINDI
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies
everywhere. I cannot stay here.
PAUL
I need a great favor.
He hands Mr. Garindi an address.
PAUL (CONT'D)
I need you to go to this address and
bring my brother-in-law and his family.
MR. GARINDI
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of
town. I cannot do this.
51.
PAUL
This would be an enormous favor to me. I
am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this
nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
MR. GARINDI
I will see what I can do.
Mr. Garindi climbs back into his car.
Paul approaches the BBC reporter Gloria and Colonel Oliver as their
interview concludes.
GLORIA
Do we know who fired the missile that
killed the president?
COLONEL OLIVER
No. But I fear it's intention may have
been to kill the peace accords and spark
a civil war between the Hutu Militia and
the Tutsi rebels.
54.
GLORIA
We've heard reports of reprisal killings.
Will the UN intervene to stop the
bloodshed.?
COLONEL OLIVER
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers
not peace makers, we can't take an
aggressive role.
GLORIA
If the UN changes your mandate could you
stop the bloodshed?
COLONEL OLIVER
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm
confident we could impose order.
GLORIA
Have you requested re-enforcements?
COLONEL OLIVER
Yes we have.
GLORIA
What was the response?
COLONEL OLIVER
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Colonel Oliver shakes Gloria's hand then moves off toward Paul.
COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the
Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
PAUL
Yes sir, but these people (points) they
cannot stay here. I've heard you have a
refugee center at the airport Stadium?
COLONEL OLIVER
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them
Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon
as we can stabilize the situation we'll
take them.
PAUL moves to the door, where Jock and Gloria argue beside a saloon car
with the word `press' spelt out in tape on the wind sreen
JOCK
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big
news story out there! We need to get out
and cover it.
55.
GLORIA
We're not going outside the hotel grounds
unless we have an armored car. That's the
ground rules.
JOCK
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think
you are, Wimbledon?
GLORIA
We cover the story from here until we
can get proper protection.
She walks off.
Paul emerges to find more refugees, some settled on the lawn, others
gathered in clumps by the doorway.
Paul calls over to the valet.
PAUL
Take these people to the rear car park,
they can't stay here.
Suddenly women and children on the lawn scream and run in fear. Behind
them bushes shake, then suddenly a bloody figure wearing only boxer
shorts bursts out from among the trees and flees to the middle of the
driveway. It's the journalist, BENEDICT, covered in blood. His ear has
been chopped off.
PANDEMONIUM. As Paul runs to him, calls to Zozo.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Get Odette!
58.
Paul grabs Benedict, tries to calm him.
PAUL (CONT'D)
What happened?
BENEDICT
They're killing everyone. The Lady
Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the
gate.
He points down the driveway. This sparks many of the women refugees,
and white guests, to flee inside the hotel.
Odette arrives with her bag, leads Benedict inside.
Jock has been filming all of this.
Now Jock runs, camera still on his shoulder, toward the gate.
Paul takes off after him.
More Tutsi refugees running up the driveway in fear.
As Jock films, Paul arrives by the gate house. UN soldiers watch the
outside road. Engines roar, then.
A convoy of Toyota trucks circle on the road outside the gate. Drunken
Militia men on the back wave spears, machetes, one, in a woman's disco
wig, waves a cordless power drill. The drill bit is red with blood.
In the next truck, TWO Militia MEN triumphantly taunt the UN soldiers
as they hold blue UN helmets high on sticks. The helmets are shot
through with holes.
MILITIAMAN #1
We kill UN. We kill you next.
ENRAGED UN SOLDIERS cock their weapons, aim.
A UN armored car races past the Militia and turns into the driveway.
The back door opens, UN Colonel Oliver jumps out.
COLONEL OLIVER
Hold the line here. Do not shoot!
The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive
by. Paul approaches Oliver
59.
PAUL
What's happening?
COLONEL OLIVER
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians
who I sent to get the lady minister.
PAUL
Where is she?
Oliver shakes his head. He helps Paul clamber into the armored car.
Paul is in the corridor, talking to Tatiana.
PAUL
Has Roger spoken yet?
TATIANA
No, Odette says he's in shock.
PAUL
How can we help him.
TATIANA
He needs to be in a safe place.
(a beat)
Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
PAUL
Give him time.
There's a clank of metal. Paul looks and sees:
A waiter struggling with a trolley of food by a door.
He hurries to help the waiter as Jock opens, indicates quiet, waves
Paul and the waiter in.
60.
The businessman Mr. Garindi knocks on room 211. Paul opens the door,
sees him, then turns back to Tatiana.
PAUL
Tatsi, come.
Tatsi appears at the door with several of the kids.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(to the kids) Go back inside.
The kids do as they're told. Paul and Tatsi shut the door and join the
businessman in the hall.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Did you find the twins?
Tatiana clings to Paul, fearful of the news.
MR. GARINDI
I made it to the house but it was empty.
It had been robbed.
TATIANA
Oh God.
63.
PAUL
Was there blood?
MR. GARINDI
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old
woman, waved to me. I went to her house.
She has the little girls. They are safe.
TATIANA
My brother, his wife. Did this woman know
of them? Did they leave the children with
her?
The businessman shakes his head no. Tears run down Tatiana's face. She
holds Paul's arm to stop from falling to the floor.
PAUL
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they
fled or could not make it home. There is
hope.
TATIANA
(to the businessman)
Please go back, bring the children to us.
MR. GARINDI
(frightened)No ma'am, I cannot do that.
The roadblocks are everywhere. They are
looking for children. They shout, "Kill
the babies to clear the infestation."
Leave them be, they are safe. I have to
go now.
Paul takes a small wad of notes from his pocket, presses it into the
businessman's hand.
PAUL
Thank you for your help.
He leaves. Tatiana pulls Paul to her.
TATIANA
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not
leave the children.
PAUL
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
French and Italian special forces pull into the parking lot, standing
tall in their jeeps, macho western super troops, triumphant. Salvation!
Wild cheering, flowers draped around necks, kisses. Westerners,
Rwandans, dance and sing in celebration.
Paul SEES: Colonel Oliver off to the side, with the commanders of the
French special forces.
OLIVER
CLOSE ON:
COLONEL OLIVER
You have a battalion, you could stop this
now. The Hutu army is no match for you.
FRENCH COMMANDER
Those are not our orders.
Oliver pulls off his blue beret, throws it on the ground, points his
finger at the French and Italian officers.
COLONEL OLIVER
You will remember this day for the rest
of your lives.
He walks off, returns, picks up his beret.
Paul watches as he storms into the lobby.
Paul follows.
A torrential African rain storm soaks everything. Porters with big
umbrellas run the white evacuees to the buses.
French and Italian commanders check off names on clipboards.
Jock films the evacuees boarding buses.
Paul watches in the rain as the final agency people are being loaded
onto buses.
Several white aid workers weep uncontrollably as they are dragged away
from frightened Rwandan coworkers.
PAUL in the rain.
cross the parking lot Colonel Oliver watches from his jeep.
Jock and his sound man embrace two beautiful young HOOKERS.
One girl begs Jock to take her with him.
HOOKER
Please, please, they will put me on the
street. They will chop me.
JOCK
Darlin', believe me, if I could...
He digs in his pockets, pulls out money, cigarettes. Everything he has
he gives to her.
Then he pulls her toward Paul, digs out his wallet.
JOCK (CONT'D)
Here. Here.
He pushes two Visa cards into Paul's hands.
JOCK (CONT'D)
Give her what she wants, room, food,
anything. Charge it all. Don't you put
her out, Paul.
PAUL
I would never do that.
JOCK
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
Here take this.
69.
Jock pulls a Rolex off his wrist.
PAUL
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
JOCK
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a
fucking aeroplane.
Jock embraces Paul, tears in his eyes.
Gloria watches from the doorway. Embarrassed by Jock, She becomes
officious.
GLORIA
Let's go, Jock.
JOCK
(turns on her)
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are
we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are
you? Well, are ya'?
GLORIA
You're drunk.
Gloria marches onto the bus.
LORIA
(to a French soldier)
What are we waiting for?
FRENCH SOLDIER
We have to evacuate some nuns from a
convent. They are on their way.
Jock kisses the hooker, heaves his camera onto the bus.
Then there is a disturbance on the driveway.
A group of French nuns, along with maybe a hundred Tutsi women and
children come running up the driveway. They are all terrified. One nun
leads them with a French flag.
French soldiers run forward. A commander orders them to form
a line,
blocking the refugees.
French soldiers begin pulling nuns from the terrified crowd.
Several nuns begin hysterically weeping, pulling Rwandan children with
them. Panic breaks out among the crowd.
70.
Jock grabs his camera, pushes off the bus.
Nuns cling to young children. French soldiers wrench the nuns away,
lift them off their feet, carry them to the bus.
JOCK films, as A FRENCH OFFICER screams at him.
The last nun is dragged onto a bus.
Jock looks to Paul, then gets on the bus.
The convoy - French jeeps, buses, Italian jeeps, UN jeeps takes off,
through the refugees, turns a corner, gone.
Paul, drenched, is left alone to fend for his new guests:
Weeping women, frightened children.
The convoy passes the gate house.
Across the road, two jeeps of Rwandan Army soldiers watch the convoy
leave. They get on the radio.
Pandemonium - the president has everyone working the phones.
PRESIDENT
Get the prime minister's office. Call
General Chareaux. Louis get the UN. Tell
them this is Belgian property.
Paul with the printed registry and Zozo with beer walk to the jeeps.
The soldiers don't wait for the Captain's order, they mob Zozo, grab
beers. The lieutenant marches up to Paul.
LIEUTENANT
Where's the guest list?
Paul hands him the printout. He studies it, reads.
LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
PAUL
The guest list. It hasn't been updated
since the murder of the president.
The lieutenant grabs Paul by the shirt.
LIEUTENANT
Are you trying to make a fool of me?
There are no Europeans left in that
hotel. Get me the names of all the
cockroaches in there.
PAUL
That will take time.
LIEUTENANT
You don't have time. If I do not have the
names, so that I can pick out the
traitors, then I will kill everyone here
in this car park. Get in there now.
Paul turns to walk back in. The lieutenant hurries to his men, pulls
beers from their hands, smashes them on the ground. One soldier comes
running to him with a radio. Paul watches. The lieutenant listens, then
calls to Paul.
LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
Hey you, come here.
Paul returns.
77.
LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
Who did you call?
PAUL
Call, sir?
LIEUTENANT
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
PAUL
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
LIEUTENANT
I will remember that name. (turns to his
soldiers) Let's go.
The soldiers roar off down the driveway.
ZOZO looks to Paul, a thank you Jesus look.
Paul emerges onto the roof, sees Tatiana, his children, and many of the
neighbors sitting huddled together. (They do not know the soldiers have
left.)
Tatiana is frozen to the spot.
PAUL
They have gone.
Tatiana grabs him. Tears of joy. Paul's neighbors swarm him, touch him,
thank him like a messiah. This effects him. He seems genuinely moved as
he shakes hands and hugs them.
ZOZO
Sir. The president of Sabena is on the
phone for you.
The pool patio is deserted except for General Bizimungu and three
soldiers who lounge at a table. Gregoire and his girlfriend sun on
reclining deck chairs like movie stars. Paul and a waiter with a tray
of drinks join the General.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
I am glad you are well.
Paul hands the scotch to Bizimungu.
PAUL
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
As long as it is scotch.
(drinks)
Your white friends have abandoned you,
Paul.
82.
PAUL
The United Nations are still here.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
(laughs) The United Nations. Madmen are
on the streets, Paul. But I will take
care of you. (chugs his drink) Your
cellar is well-stocked, right?
PAUL
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I
overheard something that I think you
should know about.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
What did you overhear?
PAUL
A discussion between an American Embassy
official and a UN Colonel.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
What did they say?
PAUL
The American assured the colonel that
they would watch everything.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
Paul points surreptitiously to the sky. The General looks up.
PAUL
Satellites.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Satellites?
PAUL
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on
your shoulder.
ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
And what will they do with these
satellites?
PAUL
The American said intervention is too
costly, better to get photographic
evidence and snatch up the high command.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
The high command? Our high command?
83.
PAUL
'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes
trial. Lock them all away forever. No
political risk, and big publicity.'
That's what he said. (a beat) I thought
I'd better tell you.
The General looks again to the sky then.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
The Americans! Who are they to put us on
trial. Let us imagine Paul when their
president Kennedy was shot, they said it
was a black man. Then their politicians,
their radio stations gave orders `we must
wipe out these black people before they
wipe out us.' What do you think would
have happened? No different.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
Paul arrives back at the pool, hands Bizimungu his briefcase. Zozo
gives the beer to the soldiers.
PAUL
I am worried about thieves and criminals
coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could
arrange for some police to guard us.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
The police are very busy.
84.
PAUL
I understand General, but when I last
talked to the president of Sabena he
promised me that anyone who helped
protect Belgian property would be
rewarded.
Bizimungu understands this is a financial proposition.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
He did.
PAUL
"Well rewarded" Those were his words.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
If I were to spare a few policemen, where
would I station them?
PAUL
The front gate would be best, General.
They could check all guests.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
I will see what I can do.
PAUL
I admire you, General. How do you keep
command of your men amidst such madness?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
PAUL
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff,
they won't work, they listen to no one.
Paul nods over toward Gregoire.
ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
He is staff?
he General gets up.
Gregoire, who is lying face down on the deck chair, doesn't see him
approach. The General pulls the deck chair from underneath Gregoire and
throws it into the pool. As Gregoire tries to scramble to his feet, the
General propels him forward with a massive kick up the ass.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
Get to work, you slug.
Gregoire races from the pool, followed by his girlfriend.
85.
The General clicks his fingers and his soldiers follow.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
Make sure, Paul, your guests are
generous.
A thick mist blankets the grounds as Paul and Gregoire emerge.
GREGOIRE
(fearful) Where are we going, sir?
PAUL
For supplies, you drive.
GREGOIRE
The fog is too heavy, sir.
PAUL
Just drive, Gregoire.
Paul gets out, tentative.
PAUL
Hello?
Nothing. He moves to the barrier, lifts the pole, places it on the
ground, hurries back to the van.
90.
The fog still hangs like a cloud. As they pull up, a group of young
Militia emerge from Toyota trucks.
MILITIAMAN #1
What do you want?
PAUL
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
MILITIAMAN #1
The commander is not here.
PAUL
He will be here.
MILITIAMAN #1
Show me your ID
Paul and Gregoire hand over their ID cards. The Militia man studies
them, then pockets the cards.
PAUL
Excuse me.
MILITIAMAN #1
What?
PAUL
Our cards, please.
MILITIAMAN #1
What cards?
PAUL
You have our cards.
91.
MILITIAMAN #1
No. But I make cards. Would you like me
to make you two cards?
PAUL
How much?
MILITIAMAN #1
One thousand francs.
Then from out of the fog, three Toyota trucks roar up. George
Rutagunda, heavily armed, in cut-off shorts and an open shirt, his
barrel chest laden with bandoliers, jumps out.
he Militia man pulls out the ID cards, hands them back.
MILITIAMAN #1 (CONT'D)
apologetic)
joke.
Rutagunda strides over.
GEORGE
Paul. My old friend.
Paul climbs out, greets George, as a Militia man swings open the doors
of the warehouse. They walk in.
Paul clambers out, stumbles, falls.
And discovers he's looking at the face of a dead child, a young Tutsi
girl, her hands clasped on her ears as though to block the sound of her
own death - an African Munz's Scream.
Paul clambers to his feet, sees that the van is on a road littered with
dead bodies, men, women, children.
he bumps were dead bodies, the van has driven over them.
A breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet.
REVEALING: a carpet of bodies, hundreds of them sprawled all along the
road as far as Paul can see. Paul wanders stunned among misshapen
corpses, made more ghostly by wisps of fog.
Finally, Paul clambers shell-shocked back into the van.
PAUL
Go back! Go back!
Gregoire throws the van into reverse.
hey bump back over the carpet of bodies, each shake and crunch another
horror.
The van pulls up at the rear suppliers entrance. Paul hops out, turns
to Gregoire.
PAUL
Tell no one what you saw, do you
understand?
Gregoire, Zozo and the porters begin unloading the van.
94.
Paul wanders to a bench set back in a manicured grove of bushes. Beyond
him a crowd of Rwandan refugee children play in the swimming pool,
laughing, jumping, splashing like they were at a municipal pool in
Central Park.
P
PAUL watches. Tears stream from his eyes, the stream grows into a
flood, he buries his face in his hands.
Then a voice.
LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
Mr. Manager.
Paul wipes his eyes, turns.
A little boy stands behind him, holding out his arm.
LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)
Mr. Manager, sir.
Then Paul sees what is wrong. The boy Has a big thorn imbedded in the
muscle of his arm. Paul studies it.
PAUL
That's a big one. (pinches the thorn)
Here we go.
Paul pulls on the thorn, the kid doesn't flinch.
Paul picks him up, carries him to the pool, throws him in.
Paul slips out onto the roof. Tatiana follows. Artillery and mortar
fire rumble in the distance. Flashes silhouette along the far hills
above Kigali.
He leads her to a blanket, a candle, two glasses and the bottle of
wine. They sit. He opens the wine.
TATIANA
(laughs) I hear we must pay for
everything. How much for this?
PAUL
A kiss.
They kiss.
TATIANA
You are a very good man, Paul
Rusesabagina.
he kisses him again.
PAUL
I have a confession. When we met...
TATIANA
In Ruhengeri?
PAUL
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
TATIANA
Yes.
96.
PAUL
I had you transferred to Kigali.
TATIANA
What?
PAUL
I bribed the Minister of Health to have
you transferred to Kigali.
TATIANA
Why?
PAUL
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
TATIANA
What was the bribe?
(silence)
What am I worth to you?
PAUL
It was substantial.
TATIANA
Tell me what it was.
PAUL
A car.
TATIANA
What sort of car?
PAUL
What does it matter.
TATIANA
I want to know.
PAUL
A Volkswagen.
TATIANA
A Volkswagen!
he slaps him playfully.
TATIANA (CONT'D)
I hope it was a new Volkswagen.
She kisses him, they lie back on the roof, kiss passionately.
97.
Paul instructs the porters to clean around the entrance.
The UN armored car comes up the driveway. Colonel Oliver gets out,
strides across the tarmac, he shakes Paul's hand.
COLONEL OLIVER
Great news, Paul, we're going to get you
out of here.
I
The sweetest words Paul has ever heard.
Paul skirts the little groups of poor families bivouacked on the lawn.
The smoke of cooking fires has replaced the Tiki lanterns. The grounds
are a mini refugee camp.
Paul joins Tatiana, Odette and Jean Baptiste who sit at a table by the
pool.
DETTE
Don't worry, Paul, we will make the next
list.
ZOZO arrives, with beers, serves them, is about to leave. Tatiana grabs
him by the arm.
TATIANA
Sit with us Zozo.
ZOZO
No ma,am, I am too busy.
PAUL
Zozo you are family, join us.
Zozo is shocked by this breach of protocol but sits.
PAUL (CONT'D)
You are my dearest friends. I promise you
before God that I will not sleep until I
have you out of here. All of you.
He embraces Jean Baptiste
JEAN BAPTISTE
It is good that you are going, Paul,
because now we know we have one person
who will save us.
Odette hugs and kisses him.
101.
ODETTE
We owe you our lives.
Paul takes Zozo in his arms.
PAUL
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother.
I will get you out of here.
ZOZO
Thank you, sir.
PAUL
Let us remember this night and tell the
world that even in hell there are good
people.
A unbreakable bond of faith with each other.
CUT TO:
The UN convoy waits outside.
Tatiana waits nervously as Paul
checks
his watch.
TATIANA
A little longer, Paul?
PAUL
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here
with the twins he is not coming. We
leave. That was your promise. Go help the
children.
The last of the evacuees clamber onto the UN trucks. The children are
on board but Tatiana waits.
TATIANA
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the
twins.
PAUL
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
TATIANA
No.
He checks his watch, then takes her in his arms.
PAUL
Look, our children are crying, please get
on the truck.
Paul helps Tatiana on board. He looks toward the door.
POV: The unlucky refugees are now crowded at the windows, lost souls
watching out from their prison at the lucky ones.
Paul whispers to Benedict as he boards.
The truck starts up. Paul runs beside it, shouts to Tatiana.
PAUL
I love you. Keep the children safe.
TATIANA
Paul!
Then another voice.
ROGER
Papa! Papa!
The convoy takes off down the driveway.
Paul, Zozo and other refugees cluster by the door.
ZOZO looks round,
I
Sees: Gregoire put a phone down.
Paul chases after him, through the door.
Gregoire disappears into the thicket of trees.
Paul after him.
Through the trees.
Gregoire, younger, faster, climbs the high wire fence.
Finally, Paul reaches the fence.
106.
Sees Gregoire escape into the bushes on the other side of the fence.
Paul gives up, turns back toward the hotel.
Swarms of crazed Militia fill the road. Gun fire breaks out.
Colonel Oliver steps from the jeep, waving his pistol in the air.
M
ilitia men swarm around him, push past to the truck.
INSIDE THE TRUCK:
MACHETE SLASHES through the canvas.
hildren scream, HANDS GRAB at people.
Benedict is hauled off the truck. Beaten.
Tatiana protects her kids in a corner, kicking at the hands that grab
for her.
107.
ON THE STREET: Xavier falls to the ground.
Screams, shouts, MORE SHOTS.
Oliver fights his way through to Xavier.
Oliver points his pistol.
The crowd backs off slightly.
Xavier gets to his feet.
BANG - more gun fire. IMMACULATA falls, wounded in the foot.
More are dragged from the trucks. Machetes flash in the sun.
Then HORNS, GUNFIRE - RWANDAN SOLDIERS drive through the crowd in two
jeeps. The crowd scatters, then re-forms as Rwandan soldiers push
between the Militia and the refugees.
As they do, another Militia gunman steps out, fires wildly at the
refugees, but wounds A RWANDAN SOLDIER in the stomach.
Suddenly fights erupt between the Militia and the soldiers.
Paul paces up and down, he can hear gunfire in the distance.
MACHINE GUNFIRE - THEN SINGLE SHOTS.
Paul jumps in the van, guns the engine, drives.
Paul's van speeds toward the gate.
THEN - A LOUD METALLIC SCREECHING NOISE
As a UN JEEP, its tires shot out, sparks cascading from wheel rims,
screams up to the guard house.
Paul slams on the brakes.
The jeep is followed by the two trucks, their canvas slashed fluttering
in the wind.
Paul throws the van into reverse and clears the way.
The convoy pulls up in front of the hotel.
Bloody and battered, the terrified refugees fall from the trucks.
108.
Paul and Odette run among the casualties. Then he sees them:
Tatiana, clothes torn, scratches on her face.
The kids screaming in terror.
PAUL runs to them, grabs, kisses, weeps louder.
Battered refugees everywhere, other hotel residents looking on -
equally terrified because: They know they are doomed.
Paul sees Roger, trembling, tears soak his face.
ROGER
Papa! Papa!
He grabs Roger up. Tatiana struggles to Paul, embraces.
PAUL
Thank God you are safe.
Tatiana breaks from the embrace.
TATIANA
Did he bring the twins?
Paul shakes his head no.
Paul sits alone on his secluded bench in the garden.
cloud of despair shrouds him.
As he watches several women dip cooking pots into the pool.
e hurries toward them.
PAUL
What are you doing?
TUTSI WOMAN
P
There is no water from the pipes.
PAUL heads for the front doors. He's intercepted by the two Rwandan
policemen stationed at the gate by Bizimungu.
GENDARME
here is our beer? You promised us beer.
PAUL
Did you explain to the good General that
I have temporarily run out of stock?
109.
GENDARME
He said to ask Mitterand and the French
to send you more.
PAUL
You will get it in due time. Now, please,
get back to the gate.
Paul meets the UN soldiers, (They are the four Ghanians who guard the
gate). They look frightened.
UN OBSERVER
The policemen have gone. What happened?
PAUL
I ran out of whiskey. Please go down and
guard us.
Then ROAR of an engine and the CRASH of splintering wood.
As a battered Toyota pickup appears, it races up the driveway. The
truck drags the wooden gatehouse on a rope behind.
Crazed Militia pack the bed of the pickup.
BANG, BANG, BANG. A Militia man fires a pistol into the air.
The Tutsi refugees camped on the lawn flee in panic as the Militia
truck speeds around the driveway.
The Militia taunt and yell at the Tutsi refugees.
The truck does a screeching turn and heads back down the driveway,
leaving a trail of splintered wood.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Get down there and stop them, please.
Now the Ghanians are really frightened.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Get down and stop them.
112.
UN SOLDIER
You know we cannot shoot.
PAUL
What do you mean you cannot shoot?
UN SOLDIER
We are peacekeepers, it is not in our
mandate to shoot.
PAUL
Then go and pretend you are soldiers.
Paul and Tatiana pass the clusters of families around their cooking
fires. They pass the pool, now just a third full. He sits her on the
bench in the grove.
TATIANA
We are almost out of water.
PAUL
We are almost out of everything.
He takes her hand.
PAUL (CONT'D)
We had a good life, you and I. I want to
make our peace. To thank God for the time
we had.
He kisses her, total love.
PAUL (CONT'D)
We have to have a plan.
TATIANA
What sort of plan?
PAUL
Our children cannot see us die first. If
the Militia comes, you must hurry up to
the roof. I will meet you there.
TATIANA
Please do not talk like this.
PAUL
We have to. If I do not come, you must
take them all by the hands and jump.
She puts her hands to her ears. He pulls them down.
113.
PAUL (CONT'D)
The machete is no way to die. Promise me
you will do it.
She cries harder and squeezes his hand in fear.
uddenly, A BANG, from behind them and then above their heads a trail
of fire - an RPG rocket - zigzags toward the hotel.
A HUGE EXPLOSION on the wall, one-story beneath the roof.
Paul throws Tatiana to the ground, covers her.
S
moke and concrete dust fall around them.
Colonel Oliver arrives in his armored truck. Paul, Odette, Benedict and
others gather around him.
PAUL
They fired a rocket at us.
COLONEL OLIVER
Yes.
Where are the Rwandan police?
PAUL
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them
away.
COLONEL OLIVER
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you
this but we've heard rumors the Militia
are getting ready to storm the hotel.
PAUL
Will you protect us.
114.
COLONEL OLIVER
I can't, I don't have the men.
VARIOUS VOICES
We have no one...We will be killed.
COLONEL OLIVER
There's one option.
PAUL
What is it?
COLONEL OLIVER
The rebels have fought their way into the
city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
They're willing to exchange them for you
all.
ODETTE
Will the Hutu army agree?
COLONEL OLIVER
I think so. They are in disarray now. The
rebels are winning, and the Hutu high
command are anxious to get some of their
men back.
TUTSI WOMAN
How would we escape?
COLONEL OLIVER
By convoy.
XAVIER
This time the Militia will kill us.
PAUL
They will surely kill us here. It's over
here. We have to take the chance.
TUTSI WOMAN
No, we'll be chopped on the street.
PAUL
We'll be chopped here.
The crowd disperses. Colonel Oliver takes Paul aside.
COLONEL OLIVER
A man came to my headquarters, asked that
I give you this.
Colonel
Oliver hands a letter.
115.
COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two.
I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I
will have to scrounge it.
PAUL
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe
with. Can your men at the gate hold out
for another day?
COLONEL OLIVER
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've
demanded to be moved back to headquarters
now.
PAUL
Give me their uniforms. I will put people
at the gate, in disguise.
COLONEL OLIVER
I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
One more day.
Colonel Oliver leaves. Their is nothing more Paul can do.
Bizimungu's jeeps arrives at the hotel. Paul greets him.
PAUL
We must go to the Diplomat.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Get in.
PAUL
Your police are at the gate?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
After the Diplomat!
Paul clambers in the back.
Paul arrives into the lobby of the Diplomat. Looters have stripped the
place bare. The convoy pulls up. General Bizimungu stands with his
pistol out. The looters see him and disperse.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Maggots!
Paul and Bizimungu rush out to the jeeps.
Militia swarm around the front of the hotel.
121.
The jeeps race through, scattering them. They screech to a halt.
Several refugees sit, huddled and battered. Bizimungu jumps out,
snatches an A.K. from a soldier, fires in the air.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Get back! (to his soldiers) Get them out
of here.
PAUL does not wait.
The grey of dawn, before the sunrise.
Colonel Oliver in his jeep leads a convoy of UN trucks past the guard
house and Bizimungu's police and up the drive.
CUT TO:
THE UN TRUCKS
Parked in front of the hotel. Tutsi refugees file up and are helped on
board by UN soldiers.
Paul helps Tatiana and the children onto a truck.
An ARGUMENT breaks out towards the back of the convoy. Paul rushes
toward Xavier and Benedict who argue.
XAVIER
They should go one truck at a time. When
the first truck gets through to the
airport, then the others will follow.
PAUL
We can't wait. We all go together or not
at all.
Paul takes matters into his own hands. He locks the doors of the hotel.
There is no going back.
PAUL (CONT'D)
It is time to leave. The Mille Collines
is closed.
Paul climbs onto the truck. The others follow, some reluctantly.
Colonel Oliver gives the signal.
124.
The trucks take off down the driveway.
The trucks crawl into the chaos of the stadium, a mass of refugees, the
wounded, lost children, abandoned old people, hundreds crammed
together.
Paul, Tatiana, and the others clamber off the trucks. They hug, cry, an
outpouring of relief. Then Tatiana spots someone among the crowds.
She rushes over.
TATIANA
Have you seen my sister Fedens?
Heads shak `no'. Tatiana moves on, more frantic, pushing through the
crowds.
TATIANA
Two little girls, twins, an old woman had
them.
More `nos'
Now she's desperate, pushing, tripping through the crowds, and around
her we see others doing the same, then
OGER (O.C.)
Mama, mama.
He reaches her, pulls at her dress.
ROGER
Mama, wait.
She takes his hand.
126.
ROGER
No, mama, look.
Tatiana turns .... and sees Paul carrying the twins in his arms.
She squeals with joy, runs to him, snatches one from his arms.
TATIANA
Oh, my babies.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Anais, it is so good to see you.
CARINE
I'm Carine!
ANAIS
(in Tatsi's arms)
And I'm Anais!
Their laughter mix with tears of joy among the crushing mass of
survivors.
