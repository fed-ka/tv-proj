      Dexter holds the blood slide up to the light.  Admires it.  
      A KNOCK at his door pulls him from the moment.He returns 
    the slide to the box and puts the box in its hiding place 
      behind the air conditioner.  

      Starting to cross, he spots the Doll Head on the 
      refrigerator.  He quickly tosses it into the freezer, goes 
    to the door and opens.  The chain catches.  There sDEBRA.

      Dexter unlatches the chain, letting his sister pass.  She 
      immediately pulls open the drapes.          DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     3.

      Dexter emerges from the courtroom and weaves through the

                      The guys at the station hate coming

                        I like the way people behave in 
                        courthouses.  Like someone turned down 
                      the volume on the humanity soundtrack.
                        They re more subdued, less impetuous.

      A Bailiff tools by with an A/VSet-up.  He passes a Family 
      (FATHER, MOTHER, and teenage DAUGHTER) and enters a 
      courtroom.  Dexter stops, regards the Family.  They re a 
      clenched-fist of unyielding grief -- the Girl and Mother 
      holding on to each other, the Father utterly bereft.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Some people would look at this family 
                      and see only tragedy and heartbreak.  
                      But I see so much more than that...

    He crosses past Dexter and enters the courtroom.  A beat.  
      Then, curious, Dexter follows.


    THE VIDEO SCREEN.  Photo slides of a fresh-faced young man,

                        Alexander Pryce finished his homework, 
                        kissed his mom and went for a jog.  He 
                        told her he d be home in time to take 
                      out the trash cans.  Just another 
                        night.  Until...

    He steps aside and the slides now show Alexander s body, 
      mangled and bloody, lying in a ditch.

                      ... until the defendant not only 
                        struck him with his car -- a heinous 
                      act in itself -- but fled the scene; 
                        leaving Alexander Pryce alone and 
                        dying for hours and hoursbefore his 
                        body was found the next morning.
                                (beat, for effect)
                        From heinous to unspeakable.

    The defendant, MATTCHAMBERS (35), handsome and humble, 
      looks to the jury and lowers his head.

                      The People will prove that, not only 
                      did Mr. Chambers strike and kill 
                        Alexander Pryce, but did so...

    ON THE FATHER IN THE COURTROOM.  Unable to bear any more, 
    he hurries up the aisle.  CAMERA follows him as he takes us 
      past the gallery -- all so deeply moved.  In fact, there 
      isn t a dry eye in the house; until we come to... Dexter.

                        I see their pain.  On some level I 
                        even understand their pain.

                        I just can t feeltheir pain.

    He turns to watch the Father leave the courtroom.

      MattChambers and his Attorney ride the crowded elevator in 
      silence.  A beat.  Then Chambers wipes the tears from his 
      eyes, turns to his lawyer and,almost imperceptibly... 
      smiles. 

      RACK TO: Dexter, against the back wall, only his predator 
      eyes visible above the heads of the people in front of him.  
    The doors open and everyone files out. Dexter hangs back, 
      watching Chambers cross the lobby.


      CODY and ASTOR lie on the floor.  Wet strips of papier-
      mache over their faces, they breathe through drinking 
      straws.  RITA sits cross-legged next to them, loving the 
      connection Dexter has with her children.

                                        ASTOR
                      Uh, mom, hello?  Tickles.

                        Oops, sorry.

      Dexter gently blows his warm breath over each of the masks.  
    He lifts them off to reveal Cody and Astor s sweet faces.  
      Then he places the masks on a piece of cardboard.

      Dexter shows them the masks.  Astor s face lights up.

      Astor blushes.  Dexter hands them their masks.

                      Put these under the light in your room 
                      and think about which watercolors you 
                        want to use when they re dry.

                        Still stinks though.

    The kids go off.

                      You have a way, Mr. Morgan.

      They sit on the couch.

                        They re such great kids; I m just 
                        following their lead.

      Rita snuggles in.  Dexter tentatively kisses her.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Lately,the thing that surprises me 
                        most about Rita is... how much I like 
                        being with her.  

      Rita responds to his kiss.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        But, she s been trying to move us to 
                      the next level.  Physically.  Problem 
                      is: every time I ve gone to that place 
                        with a woman, it all goes wrong... for 
                        both of us... and then the relationship 
                      is over.

      Rita separates; interrupting Dexter s train of thought.

                                        RITA
                        I ve got the early shift at the hotel 
                        tomorrow.  Some big convention coming 
                        through. 

      Dexter takes Rita s hand, feigns sympathy.

                                        DEXTER
                          I understand.  You need the hours.

      A beat as two damaged people hide their relief.  Then --        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     12.

                        Dex, it s been a long time since we ve 
                        gone out -- really gone out -- and I 
                        want that.  So, pick a date.

      Dexter kisses her nose.

                                        DEXTER
                        I pick you.


      TIGHT ON Dexter.  A beat.  Then he sprays something on his 
      face.  He switches off the lights and we go DARK.  Then the 
      eerie glow of a BLACK-LIGHTcomes on and we realize that 
      Dexter hasLuminoledhis own face.  He passes the blue-
      light wand in front of it.  Fascinated, he observes the 
      blood residual from the man in the alley.


      Dexter working at his desk.  Debra hovering, snooping.

                      God no.  He smelled like cheese.

                      So, then mechanic Sean?

      Dexter keeps busy, not really focusing on his sister.

                                        DEBRA
                      You really want to hear this?

                        getting serious, I d like to meet him.

      Debra takes something from his desk.  He takes it back.

      DOAKES enters from the stairwell;moving past Dexter, Debra 
    and Batista with a scowl. 

                                        BATISTA 
                        What crawled up his ass?

                      He hates lab rats. 

      Batista turns to Dexter.

                                        BATISTA
                        Here s the headline:  it s you lab 
                        rats that make us cops look good.

      LaGuerta comes out of her office.  Somber. 

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Listen up.  We just got an ID on the 
                        body from the alley.  His name was 
                        RickySimmons... he was a cop.

      A hush falls over the room.  Everyone shocked to learn they 
      lost one of their own.  Especially Doakes. 

      OMITTED1616


      Doakes and LaGuerta burst in.  LaGuerta stops.

                        Jesus mio.

      KARA SIMMONS(30) lies in a pool of blood.  The walls and 
      floor are a mosaic of blood spatter.  Barely alive, Kara 
      stares, weak and terrified, at Doakes and LaGuerta.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Call it in!

    He rushes to Kara and drops to his knees. There s a bullet 
      wound high in her chest.  Doakes compresses the wound with 
    the heel of his hand and looks to a shocked LaGuerta.

      LaGuerta pulls her weapon and moves down the hall.  Doakes 
      whispers softly to Kara.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Kara, Kara?It s me, James.  Help is

      Kara tries to speak, can t.  The light in her eyes fading.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        You re okay, Kara...
                              (not believing it)

      CONTINUE TO CRANE UP, Laguerta steps into FRAME and takes

    His pager vibrates.  He slips out of the courtroom.


      Dexter examines the bloody floor where Kara was found.  
      Batista comes up.

                                        BATISTA
                        This is fucked-up, man: going after a 
                        cop s family.  Who d do such a thing?

      Dexter clicks off a rapid series of PHOTOGRAPHS.

                         Swhywe re here.

    But Batista is shaken.

                                        BATISTA
                        It s still fucked-up.

      CAPTAIN MATTHEWS snaps his cell phone shut, turns to

      Dexter and Batista listen in as they work.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        What s the word on the wife?

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Should be in surgery by now.

      DEXTER checks the screen on his digital camera, clicking 
      through photos he s taken.  

                                        BATISTA
                      Que paso?

                                        DEXTER
                        There s an inconsistency somewhere.  

                                        BATISTA
                      And that would be?

                                        DEXTER
                      Not sure, but it s the answer to a 
                        question we haven t thought of yet.

      Something on his camera screen grabs his eye: a thin streak 
    of blood on the floor, ending at the couch.  Dexter moves 
    to that section of the floor and finds the streak -- thick 
      where Kara s body was; almost translucent at its other end.  
    He drops to one knee and looks under the couch.

                                        DEXTER
                      ... Angel.

      Batista joins him.  Shines a flashlight on a bloody cell 
      phone.  Using his pencil, Batista slips it out into view.

                                        BATISTA
                      Uh, Lieutenant.

      LaGuerta and Doakes come over.  See the phone.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Whose is it?

                        Check last number dialed.

      Batista presses a button with the pencil s eraser.  The 
      readout shows:  Ricky .  Doakes flips his cell open.

                                        BATISTA
                      It was Dexter who...

    But Doakes moves off.  Batista bags Kara s phone. 

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Have the tech guys get me a complete 
                        history on bothcell phones.  Incoming 
                      and outgoing.  Land-lines too.

    She goes.  Dexter steps up.

                                        DEXTER
                        Angel, when can I get back in here to 
                      do my red-string thing?

                                        BATISTA
                      We got a shitloadof work to do.  I 
                        can t release this scene till 
                        tomorrow.  Lo siento, bro.

      Dexter nods and leaves the house.


      Chambers steps outof the elevator.  He notices the Pryce 
      family, crosses to them and humbly offers his hand.  
      Wanting no part of him, they move off.  Chambers shrugs and 
      heads for the exit doors.

    PAN to Dexterat a shoe-shine stand.  Watching, studying... 
      making sure.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      Not guilty.  MattChambers may have 
                        found a way to beat the system... but 
                      so have I.


    ON THE LOUVREDWINDOWS sweating with condensation.  As we 
    PAN to find Dexter asleep in his bed, we HEAR the AC 
      working overtime, already fighting the early morning Miami 
      heat and humidity.

    The phone RINGS.  Dexter stirs, checks the caller ID and 
      answers.  INTERCUT with Debra on a street corner.

                      So Miami is the haystack and the ice 
                        truck is the needle, right?

                        Then, brother... I just found the 
                        fuckingneedle!


      A Uniform Cop POPS THE LOCK AND THE DOOR FALLS OPEN. 
      Dexter, Debra and Batista climb in.  In the b.g., we can 
    see the area is now a full-blown crime scene with LaGuerta 
    and Captain Matthews huddled nearby.

                                        BATISTA
                        Cold in here.

                                        DEBRA
                        Duh, ice truck.

    But Dexter is looking below CAMERA.

      A BLOCK OF CLEAR ICE. Our guys squat down and peer into it.

                                        BATISTA
                        Dios mio.

                                        DEBRA
                        Looks like candy.

      PUSH IN ON THE ICE.  There are five multi-colored 
      jellybeans suspended in the frozen water.  Then we 
      understand what we re looking at: five fingertips, each 
      nail painted a different cheerful color.  Debra jumps back.

                                        DEBRA
                        Holy shit, they re fucking fingertips!

                                        DEXTER
                                (looking closely)
                        Clean slices.  No Blood.  I m guessing 
                      he drained it from the body before 
                        these cuts were made.

                                        DEBRA
                        How s he do that?  Some kind of pump?

                                        BATISTA
                        Nope.  Forensics did a work-up on the 
                        last victim.  Our guy s old school.

                                        DEXTER
                      He hoists them up and severs the 
                        jugular.  Lets the heart do all the 
                        work.  It s the most effective method, 
                        really.

      Debra and Batista turn to go.        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     22A.

                        Fucking butcher.

      They exit the truck, leaving Dexter alone with the grisly 
      find.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        There are 206 bones in the human body.  
                      He could have left any of them.  

      Dexter circles the block of ice, looks at the fingerprints.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      But he gave us exactly what we need to 
                        identify the victim.
                                (beat, a smile)
                        Like he s leaving a trail of bread 
                        crumbs.


      Batista moves through, on his cell phone.

                                        BATISTA
                        What, a man can t call his wife three 
                        times in one day?

    He hurries out, taking us to Dexter s Lab.

      DEXTER studies his photos from the Kara Simmonsshooting.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      To some cops, blood spatter analysis 
                        makes about as much sense as using a 
                        napkin.   Drip pattern .   Cast-off . 
                         Point of origin .  But a single drop 
                      of blood...

                      ... cantell a whole long story. 

    He swivels in his chair until he s facing the Bullpen.

    HIS POV: Doakes at his desk.  Headphones on, he listens to 
      a digital recorder.  His face a solemn grimace of 
      concentration.

      A bulletin board behind him displays the  GUERRERO CRIME 
      FAMILYTREE .  At the top of the pyramid is a photo of 
      CARLOSGUERRERO.  Tanned, handsome, imposing.

      LaGuerta comes out of her office, puts a hand on Doakes  
      shoulder.  He takes off the headphones, looks up.

                        She s still in surgery.  The doctors 
                        are... hopeful.

      Doakes takes a beat, then plugs the digital recorder into a 
      small speaker and presses  play .        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     25.

      Then it comes... the sound of a GUNSHOT.  Doakes looks to his 
      colleagues.  Everyone s stricken.  A beat, then -- 

      Batista bursts in.  Breaks the silence.

                                        BATISTA

      Doakes grabs his jacket and hauls ass out of there.

    He goes.  Once Chambers is out the door, Dexter lifts his 
      glass from the bar and pockets it.  

      Then he cranes his neck to look outthe window and watches 
    as Chamberspasses a family getting into a mini-van.
      Clearly drunk, he gets in his car and fishtails away.

                        went as far as validating their own

    The fingerprints match positiveto two other crimes in two 
      other states.  Dexter prints-out the results.  We see news 
      clippings and photographs:

       2000:  OFF-DUTY FIREFIGHTER KILLED IN WRONG-WAY COLLISION.  
                            SOUTH BOSTON MAN ARRESTED 

      Dexter taps at his keyboard and two NEWS PHOTOS appear.

      A seething Doakes clicks off the recorder, scowls at an 
      arrogantly stoic Cervantes.  LaGuerta hovers nearby.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                      Way we see it: you re in at the kill 
                      of RickySimmons.  But that s not 
                        enough for you... or for Guerrero...

                                        CERVANTES
                        Rickyis dead?  That saddens me.

    The door opens and a Cop hands something to LaGuerta.  As 
    she pockets it, Cervantes glances through the open doorway 
    and sees half a dozen other cops watching him with 
      unconcealed contempt.

                                        CERVANTES
                        Wait, you re not implying that Ricky
                        Simmonswas a cop, are you?  I m 
                        truly... disappointed.

      LaGuerta shifts her weight.  A subtle reminder that she s 
      there and that Doakes has to stay professional.  


      Dexter considershis web of red strings.  Batista watches, 
      fascinated.

                                        BATISTA

                        Okay, Kara Simmonswas shot while she 
                      was running.  Her phone call tells us 
                        that; her blood tells us that.

    He walks through and around the maze.

                                        BATISTA 
                      She was running for the back door...

      They re in the kitchen now.  Batista nods to the door.

                                        BATISTA

                                (beat)
                        Then she sees the shooter.

                      And the shooter sees her. 
                                (beat)
                        She s shot high in the chest.  She 
                        stumbles, throwing blood on the walls: 
                        here and here.  And leaving this blood-
                        trail on the floor.  But her forward 
                        momentum only brings her to...

    He steps back into the living room; to the bloody spot 
      where Kara was found.          DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     31.

                      ... here.

    He ponders this.  Then, charged, he whips around.  

      CLOSE ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR.  A tiny dark red dot.  TILT UP 
    as Dexter kneels down to study it.  Batista leans in.

                                        BATISTA

                        Ergo: this is not her blood.

      Batista takes out his utility knife.  Together, they slice 
      a wedge containing the red dot out of the linoleum.  Dexter 
      holds it up to Batista.

                                        DEXTER 
                        Angel, meet our shooter.


      Doakes has moved closer in on a still-defiant Cervantes.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                      Not only do I have a dead cop, someone 
                        broke into his house and shot his wife.

                        Simmons  wife was fucking around. 
                        Maybe he tried to kill the bitch 
                        himself; then felt so bad about it, he 
                        committed suicide.

    An evil grin as he leans forward.

      Without warning, Doakes PUNCHESCervantes, sending him 
      reeling.  LaGuerta grabs Doakes, but he s too far gone.  
      Other cops rush in and separate Doakes and Cervantes.  
      Doakes, straining against their grip, screams at Cervantes.

      LaGuerta steps in.  SheRIPS Cervantes  shirt sleeve up to 
    his elbow, exposing a bandaged wound on his forearm.  Then 
    she tears the bandage off.  The gash in Cervantes  arm is 
      just the right size.

      Dexter and Batista do a computer slide show for LaGuerta

      DEXTER looks out to the Bullpen.  The Cops out there move 
      slowly, dented by the death of a brother.

      CLOSE ON HARRY in his dress blue uniform.  Hat, medals, 
      etc.  BEGIN SLOW PULLBACK.

                        this to him.

    He rises and straightens his coat.

                        pure as truth.  As perfect as nature.

      Dexter readies the abandoned space for his upcoming kill.

    He lays out the lethal power tools.  Then stretches out the 
      cord to the rechargeable battery and looks for an outlet.

    He fills the syringe, presses out the air bubble.


    We watch through the observation window as Kara lies in her 
      bed, heavily bandaged and heavily sedated.  Doakes appears, 
      nods to the Uniformed Cop on protection-detail and enters.

    He looks across to Kara and stops, absorbing the sight of a 
      fragile life so cruelly damaged.  Then he sits next to her 
    and takes her hand.

    He talks softly to her.  Her eyes glisten as she tries to 
      smile.  Doakes looks to the Uniform.  The Cop makes himself 
      scarce.

      Kara points to a glass of water.  Doakes retrieves it and, 
      holding the back of her head, helps her drink.  A tender 
      moment.          DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     36.


      Doakes turns to put the water down.  When he turns back, 
      Kara is... mercifully... asleep.  Doakes touches the back 
    of his hand to her cheek.

      Dexter, Rita, Debra and her date, SEAN at a table.

      Dexter glances over to see a GOOMBAH throw down some cash 
    and grab a large take-out box of live lobsters.  Dexter s 
      eyes follow the guy outside where he climbs into a black

      respond.  But Rita goes for the subject change. 

                                        RITA
                      So, how long you two been going out?

      Seanforks up the last remnants fromDebra s plate, chews.  

                                        SEAN
                        Couplaweeks maybe.

    He pulls Debra into a rather moist kiss.

                                        DEXTER
                      Uh, Deb never mentioned how you met.           DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     37.


                                        SEAN
                      She brought her car into my shop.

      Rita puts her hand on Dexter s leg, an attempt at 
      affection.  Dexter looks down, at a bit of a loss.  

                                        DEXTER
                      Oh, you run your own place?

                                        SEAN
                        I wish.

        Rita withdraws her hand.

                                        DEXTER
                        Someday, huh?

                                        DEBRA
                        Dex, enough with the inquisition.

                                        SEAN
                        Hey, if I had a sister with legs like 
                        yours, I d be checking out the dude 
                        she s seeing too.

                                        DEBRA
                      Is this guy a keeper or what?

    She kisses Sean, bites his lower lip.  An awkward beat 
      between Dexter and Rita.  Such effortless intimacy sorely 
      missing in their relationship. 


      Dexter, Rita, Debra and Sean get ready to leave.  Debra 
      kisses her brother; then hugs Rita.

                                        DEBRA
                        Let s do this again sometime.

    She mouths the words  No Way  to Dexter.

                                        RITA
                      I d like that.

      Sean puts a possessive arm around Debra.

                                        SEAN
                        C mon, babe.  Papa wants dessert.

      Debra kisses him and, laughing, they exit.

    He goes to put his hand on the small of Rita s back, but 
    she doesn t notice.  She looks off, lost in thought. 

                                        RITA
                        They could barely keep their hands off 
                        each other. 

    She seems small and alone as she heads for the doors.

                        totally lost.  


      Cervantes in his cell, lying on his cot.  The sounds of 
      caged men echo off the walls.  A GUARD approaches.

                                        GUARD
                      Off your ass, Cervantes.  Hands behind 
                        your back; walk backwards and assume 
                      the position.

      Cervantes is an old pro at this.  Walking backwards, he 
      puts his hands through the slot in the cell door and the 
      Guard cuffs him.

                                        GUARD
                        Step away.

      Cervantes steps away and the Guard unlocks the door.

                                        GUARD
                        Exit the cell.

                        Call came down: they want you moved to 
                        a more secure block.

      Cervantes smiles as the Guard leads him away.


    The Guard and Cervantes continue, Cervantes jabbering.

                                        CERVANTES
                      You think that call to take care of me 
                        came down from the warden?

                        listens to?  Get used to it because...

    The Guard SHOVES Cervantes into a dark alcove and SLAMS a 
      shiv into Cervantes  chest.  Again and again and again.  
      It s alarmingly vicious and thorough.  Cervantes slumps to 
    the floor.  Already dead.

    The Guard drops the shiv and walks away.

      Dexter sings to Astor and Cody as they drift off to sleep.  
    He has a beautiful, haunting, voice.

      Astor and Cody are now asleep.  Dexter notices the papier-
      mache masks beneath the night-light, each brightly painted 
      with watercolors, and smiles.  Then he sees Rita in the 
      doorway, moved by the tenderness in her man.  


      Dexter and Rita watching TV, her head resting peacefully on 
    his shoulder.  Dexter turns to her and smiles that smile of 
      his.  Then he puts his arm around her and pulls her close 
    as they resume watching TV.

      A beat as Rita makes a decision.  She clicks the TV to 
       mute , then lifts her head and nibbles Dexter s earlobe.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Every time a woman tries to do this to 
                      me it... tickles.

      Rita flicks her tongue in his ear.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Still, it s not entirely unpleasant.

    He turns to her; hesitates.          DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     40.

                        They sleep through thunderstorms.

    She kisses him on the lips, her tongue searching.  Dexter, 
    in his way, responds.  He cups her breast, kisses it.  Then 
    he starts unbuttoning her blouse and slips his hand inside.

      Dexter brings his head up and, closing his eyes, kisses her 
      lips.  Rita catches her breath, stiffens.  At first, Dexter 
      thinks it s a desired response.  But Rita doesn t 
        unstiffen.Dexter opens his eyes.  Rita looks away.

                                        RITA

      Instead of showing his usual disdain for Dexter, Doakes 
      simply nods.  Dexter nods back.  A fleeting connection.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        I hope you know what you re doing.

    He leaves.  LaGuerta goes out to the bullpen where Doakes 
      moves other photos up higher in the  GUERRERO CRIME FAMILY 
      TREE , replacing the void left by Cervantes  now-missing 
      picture.  She clocks his expression: utter desolation.  
      Then she continues on to --        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     44.



      Batista pours himself a cup of coffee.  LaGuerta enters.

      Doakes at his computer, searching the database for more 
      information on the Guerrero Crime Family.  As a name and a 
      photo come on-screen, he turns to the bulletin board and 
      notes something on the family tree.  Back to the computer, 
      back to the bulletin board and... there s LaGuerta.

                                        LAGUERTA

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Why reyou going at this so hard?

                        Someone comes after one of us, he 
                        comes after all of us.

      LaGuerta pulls a swivel chair from an empty desk and sits.  
    She takes a long beat, casting for the right words.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        I know that look, Maria.  Whatever 
                        you ve got to say, sayit.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        I just got off the phone with the 
                        hospital...

      Doakes turns to her -- trapped between hope and dread.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Kara Simmonssuffered massive heart 
                        failure 30 minutes ago.

      Doakes grabs his jacket and starts to rise.  LaGuerta puts 
    her hand on his leg, keeping him in place.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        James... she died.

      Doakes struggles with his ricocheting emotions: anger, 
      outrage... grief.  He closes his eyes, his lips quivering 
    for the briefest moment.  

                                        LAGUERTA
                      You and I rode together for years.  
                        Shared a lot of shit, good and bad.  
                      You helped make me the cop I am today.
                                (beat)
                      And it s the cop in me who has to ask 
                        you... was Cervantes right?  Was Kara 
                        Simmonssleeping with someone other 
                        than Ricky?

      Doakes looks away.  LaGuerta presses on... 

                                        LAGUERTA
                                (almost a whisper)
                      ... was it you?

      Doakes stands up; looks from his computer to the board to 
      LaGuerta.  And then, finally... he nods.        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     46.


                                        LAGUERTA

      Doakes takes a long, reflective pause.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Kara was going to ask for a divorce as 
                        soon as Rickyfinished his undercover.  
                      She didn t want to hurt him while he 
                      was on the case.
                                (beat)
                      She still had love for him.

      LaGuerta is humbled by such a rare confession from this 
      stoic man. 

                                        LAGUERTA
                      And you loved her.

      Doakes turns to her, his eyes red.

                        this case.

      Doakes looks at her, his jaw set.

      LaGuerta rises, puts a hand on his shoulder and leaves.


      Dexter and Debra hammering their way through a pile of 
      crabs.

                      And the best part?  LaGuerta had to 
                      say the actual words. I thought her 
                        head would explode. 

                                        DEXTER

      Debra wipes her hands.  Sips her drink.  Takes a beat.

                                        DEBRA
                        Turns out there was another woman.

                        Technically... okay, yes.  Imagine me 
                        falling for the wrong guy, huh?  

    She blinks away a tear.  

                                        DEXTER
                      And you and he are...

                      So over.  I dumped his married ass.

    She blows her nose into her napkin.

                                        DEBRA
                        I just wish I could get into a healthy 
                        relationship like you and Rita.  You 
                        know, without the drama and the 
                        tension and the uncertainty.

                                        DEXTER
                        Yeah, I m a lucky guy.

      Debra goes back to her meal.  Just then, the front door 
      opens and CarlosGuerrero and his Driver enter.  Patrons 
      either stare or avert their eyes as Guerrero makeshisway 
    to a long table in back.The other guys at the table rise. 
      They offer him the respect due a powerful and dangerous 
      man.  ThenGuerrero peels off and heads for the restroom.

      FLASHBACK:


    as Dexter rises from the table and turns back to Debra.  
      Crab-focused, she missed Guerrero s entrance.

                                        DEXTER
                        Back in a sec.

                      I m kind of running the gamut here, 
                          emotion-wise.  And you re leaving me?

      Dexter gestures toward the bathroom and shrugs.

      Guerrero at a urinal.  Dexter s head rises part-way into 
      FRAME, our crocodile shot, and we realize we ve been 
      looking in a mirror.  Dexter finishes washing his face.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Sometimes the universe plays itself 
                      out in beautiful mystery.  It s like 
                        fate has chosen to speak just to me.

    He grabs some paper towels, wipes his hands.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      All the planning, the making sure... 
                        does it go away because I have a 
                        chance to rid the world of a cop-
                        killer and balance the books? 

    He tosses the paper towels in the trash.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      Do I just ignore everything my father 
                        taught me about how to do this right, 
                        about how to stay safe so I can do it

                        I just need a sign.

      Just then, Guerrero s cell phone rings.  He answers.

                                        GUERRERO
                        Yeah.

                        care of him.

      Guerrero sees Dexter staring at him in the mirror.

                                        GUERRERO
                      The fuckyou looking at?

      Dexter simply holds his look, his eyes giving nothing away.

                      For the last time.

    He draws blood for his slide.  Chambers is frantic.

                                        DEXTER
                        Then none of this is your fault? 

                                        CHAMBERS
                        I swear.

                                        DEXTER
                      And you have no remorse?

                                        CHAMBERS
                      How can I?  I already told you:  I 
                        didn t do anything.

                                        DEXTER
                        Thank you.

                      For what?

                      For making this easier.          DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     52.


                                        CHAMBERS
                        What do you mean?

                                        DEXTER
                        I have no remorse either.

    He reaches for the surgical power saw.

                                        CHAMBERS
                        Please!  Wait, wait... okay.  It was 
                        me... only it wasn t me.  It was the 
                        booze...
                                (weeping now)
                        It... it takes me over.

                                        DEXTER 
                        A point of view to which I m not 
                        unsympathetic.  Neither you nor I is 
                        completely in control of our own 
                        destinies.  Although, at this 
                        moment...

    He brings the vibrating blade to Chambers  neck.

                                        DEXTER 
                      ... I seem to have the upper hand.

                                        CHAMBERS
                      NO!  I m sorry.  Really, I m so sorry.

                                        DEXTER
                      Oh, that s nice...

    He nods to the photos of the New Mexico and Massachusetts 
      victims.

                                        DEXTER
                      ... but you ve done this too many 
                        times to be sorry. 
                                (helooks into his eyes)
                      You are beyond forgiving.

    He kills MattChambers.


      CAMERA TRAVELS over the late-night crab lovers.  FIND 
      Guerrero and his mob reveling at their long table.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        CarlosGuerrero has chosen to live in 
                        a dangerous world.  That s his truth.  
                      My truth is: that world doesn t need 
                      me to balance its books.        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     53.


      PUSH IN on the Wiseguy, none the wiser.


      Dexter packs up: his equipment, the bloody plastic -- 
      pieces of MattChambers.


      Dexter slips his newly-won slide into the box, then places 
    the box behind the AC unit.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      The problem with spending so much time 
                      on the outside looking in... watching 
                        people, studying them... 

    He crosses to the refrigerator and opens the freezer.  
      There are the Doll Parts, each so carefully wrapped.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      ... isthat I almost always know what 
                        they re going to do.  

    He takes out the Doll Head, smiles, and puts it back on the 
      freezer door.  He starts to close the freezer; stops.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      So when someone does something I 
                        didn t see coming...

    THE TINY WRAPPED DOLL HANDS.  Dexter unwraps one.  Nothing 
      unusual.  He unwraps the other.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I really have to stop and...

    The fingernails are painted with the same colors as the 
      fingertips from the block of ice.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      ... appreciatethe moment.

    GO TO WHITE and we re --        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     54.



      CAMERA slowly moves over still water (reminiscent of the 
      opening shot).  CAMERA FINDS Dexter again submerged up to 
    his eyeballs.  The human crocodile.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        There are no secrets in life.  

    The breath from his nostrils ripples the water.  We re --


      Dexter in his bathtub.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Just hidden truths that lie beneath 
                      the surface.

    And he sinks into the water, disappearing from view.
