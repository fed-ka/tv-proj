  A SEA OF SPECTATORS scream in SLOW MOTION, their faces 
  twisted in bloodlust. Time smashes back to NORMAL as a 
  MURMILLO crashes against the wall in front of the crowd. He 
  narrowly avoids

    A RETIARIUS  TRIDENT

  as it gouges the wood next to his head. TIME SLOWS AND 
  ACCELERATES as Murmillo attacks. The RETIARIUS counters, 
  casting his net. Murmillo dodges, but his opponent's trident 
  finds its mark, ripping open his shoulder.

  BLOOD SPLATTERS

  across the nearest spectators. ADJUST to find BATIATUS AND 
  TITUS in the stands, just out of reach of the crimson rain.

                                        TITUS
                        A net and trident? The man appears 
                        more common fisherman than 
                        gladiator.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The style is called Retiarius, 
                        carried from the outer regions.

                                        TITUS
                        They should carry it back. I favor 
                        the Murmillo.

  The Retiarius draws more blood. The crowd ROARS.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The crowd takes opposite opinion. 
                        Soon we will find a Retiarius upon 
                        the sands in every game. And the 
                        ludus absent them tragically 
                        lacking.

                                        TITUS

                        Very well. Yet place net and 
                        trident in hands of one of our 
                        lesser man.

  Batiatus beams at the minor victory. The crowd surges to 
  their feet as the Retiarius sends the Murmillo crashing to 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

  the sand. Murmillo scrambles, barely avoiding the trident as 
  it slams down again and again, blasting SAND at the CAMERA.

  MURMILLO RALLIES,

  regaining his footing. But the Retiarius swings his net, 
  entangling Murmillo. Murmillo goes down. Retiarius is on him 
  in a flash, slamming his trident down through Murmillo s 
  face plate.

  BLOOD SPRAYS

  as the Murmillo goes limp. The crowd ROARS. Batiatus joins 
  them, delighted by the carnage.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Did I not tell you?! Listen to 
                        them!

                                        TITUS
                                  laughs)(
                        A spectacle, to be sure.

                                        BATIATUS
                        All the more thrilling, if viewed 
                        from the pulvinus.

  Batiatus casts a sour look up to the pulvinus where TULLIUS 
  and VETTIUS laugh and drink, surrounded by PRIVILEGED 
  ROMANS. Titus waves the comment away.

                                        TITUS
                        Invitation was extended.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And refused?

                                        TITUS
                        The pulvinus is too far removed. I 
                        would witness the games here, among 
                        the people. With son beside me.

  OFF Batiatus, the crumb of his father s affection catching 
  him by surprise, yet deeply appreciated...



  A SECUTOR hammers Ashur. Ashur is not without skill, but is 
  outmatched by his opponent.

  A BLOODIED DAGAN RUSHES PAST,

  engaged in his own battle against a HOPLOMACHUS (spear, 
  small shield). They trade thunderous blows. The Hoplomachus 
  thrusts with his spear. Dagan narrowly avoids it, counters 
  by

  HACKING OFF THE ARM

  that wields it. Hoplomachus screams. Dagan stabs him through 
  the throat, silencing the man forever.

  ASHUR

  scrambles to avoid his own opponent s deadly weapon. WHAM! 
  The Secutor lands a bone jarring blow to Ashur s helmet. It 
  flies off as he crashes to the sand. He regains his senses 
  just in time to see

  THE SECUTOR

  raising his weapon for the death blow. But a SWORD suddenly 
  bursts through the Secutor s stomach, showering Ashur in 
  blood. Dagan has run the man through from behind. Ashur 
  surges to his feet and CLEAVES THE MAN S HEAD IN TWO.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

  THE CROWD

  goes wild. Ashur throws his arms up in victory.

                                        ASHUR
                        Hasdrubal falls! As all men who 
                        face Ashur!

  Batiatus is on his feet, CHEERING with the rest of the 
  crowd. Titus frowns at Ashur s grandstanding.

                                        TITUS
                        The man assumes credit owed his 
                        better.

                      He is but swelled by the moment.

                                        TITUS
                        Perhaps he will turn greater 
                        performance next time.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You speak of what may never pass.

  Batiatus glares up at the pulvinus as Tullius rises to 
  address the crowd.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Now that the less prominent matches 
                        have passed, let us have something 
                      of note. Vettius, make 
                          presentation.

                                          VETTIUS
                        I give the good people of Capua 
                        this day my latest acquisition! 
                        Certain to inflame passion! And 
                        ignite fear in all who oppose him! 
                        From the darkest lands east of the 
                        Rhine... Behold Caburus! Murmillo!

  CABURUS takes the sands to the roar of the crowd. He s a 
  big, ugly, Nordic giant of a man.

                                        TITUS
                        The crowd favors Vettius  offering.

                        They greet Gannicus with louder 
                        voice, yet he stands removed from 
                        the games.

                        fate again. Our men see victory, 
                        only to be awarded exclusion.

                                          VETTIUS
                        And who shall face the beast! Enter 
                        Drappes! Thraex!

  DRAPPES takes the sands, squaring nervously for battle.

                                        TITUS
                        The fruits reaped, when you offend 
                        a man beyond our station.

  Titus glances up at Tullius, laughing with his privileged 
  compatriots in the pulvinus.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Begin!

  Caburus attacks, pounding Drappes. The vicious beating 
  continues in the background.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I but stood ground to protect our

                        lofty goals. We must be humble if I 
                      am to repair relations with 
                        Tullius, and see all our men 
                        returned to the sands.

                        Strike it from your thoughts, and 
                        place mind and effort towards more 
                        reasonable pursuits.

  Caburus destroys Drappes in a spray of blood. The crowd goes 
  wild. Titus takes them in with an envious frown.

  feel from his father rapidly cooling...



  An agitated LUCRETIA moves through the market with GAIA. 
  MELITTA attends.

                        the old arena, and yet we are swept 
                        aside. Absent even casual regard.

  Gaia searches the market for something, half paying 
  attention.

  PETRONIUS, a distinguished Roman, barters with a GRAIN

                      so blessed?

  Petronius turns, eyes Gaia quizzically. Can t place the 
  face.

                                          GAIA(cont'd)
                        Gaia. We were introduced at one of 
                        Varus  affairs.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        Oh, yes, of course. Apologies.

                        None required. Seeing you so 
                        unexpected has lifted questionable 
                        spirits. Lucretia can attest to --

                                  perking up)(
                        Lucretia? Wife to the lanista, 
                        Batiatus?

  Lucretia registers surprise at the recognition.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I do call him husband, yes.

  Petronius takes her hand, delighted. Gaia shifts 
    uncomfortably, forgotten in his excitement.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        I have heard your house spoken of.

                        And the pleasures contained 
                        within...

  Petronius smiles knowingly. OFF LUCRETIA, her smile in 
  response barely masking her discomfort...



  Practice swords clash. PULL BACK to reveal CRIXUS sparring 
  with GNAEUS. Crixus sends him to the ground, dazed. Crixus 
  offers his hand, glancing over at BARCA listlessly working 
  the palus as he helps Gnaeus up.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Barca has lost form, since Auctus

  Oenomaus returns with a bloodied Ashur and Dagan, GUARDS and 
  LUDUS SLAVES trailing.

                                        ASHUR
                      We return anointed in the blood of 
                        our enemies! Hasdrubal and Kleitos 
                        have met their end! The first of 
                        many to fall beneath our swords in 
                        the arena!

  A few lackluster cheers from the men. The equivalent of a 
  golf clap. Ashur glowers.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        See yourselves to the baths.

                                        ASHUR

                        ass lickers.]

  He moves off with Dagan. Oenomaus  eyes fall on an 
  unwelcomed sight: Gannicus sitting in the shade, sipping a 
  cup of water.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Gannicus. Pair with Rhaskos.

                                        GANNICUS
                      To what end? If I am not to fight 
                      in the arena, I would remain in the 
                        shade.

                                        TITUS (O.S.)
                        Doctore.

  Oenomaus looks up to find Titus and Batiatus on the balcony.

                                        TITUS
                        Send the man up. I would have 
                        words.

  Gannicus frowns, knowing that can t be good. He rises, 
  WIPING US TO --                                                                                    11.



  FOLLOW CRIXUS  PRACTICE SWORD as it slices through the air 
  in SLOW MOTION, connecting with GNAEUS  FACE. Wood 
  splinters. Blood flies. Gnaeus drops.

                        Gnaeus!

  Gnaeus looks up to see Oenomaus, whip clenched in his hand. 
  Voice firm and commanding. Closer to the Doctore we will 
  come to know in season 1.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Your mastery of the sword falls to 
                        question. The net and trident are 
                        your weapons now.

  The other men chuckle as a LUDUS SLAVE hustles over with a 
  practice net and trident. Gannicus glances over from where 
  he sits in the shade, curious at the change in Oenomaus  
  demeanor. Gnaeus scowls.

                                        GNAEUS
                        A fucking net, Oenomaus?

  Oenomaus suddenly unleashes his whip. The shotgun CRACK of 
  leather splits the air. Gnaeus grimaces as an ANGRY WELT 
  starts from his skin. The men go quiet.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You will do as commanded, absent 
                        complaint. Or see flesh stripped 
                        from bone.

  A tense beat. Gnaeus backs down, lowering eyes in respect.

                                        GNAEUS
                        Yes, Doctore.

  Gnaeus takes the net and trident. Oenomaus barks at the men.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Return to training!

  The men comply. Gannicus ambles over.

                                        GANNICUS
                        You speak as Jupiter, hurling bolts 
                        from the heavens.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Raised there by words and touch of 
                        loving wife.

  Gannicus forces a smile. Oenomaus fails to notice the pain 
  behind them.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

                        from shade.

  Oenomaus strides off. Gannicus watches him for a second, 
  before shifting his eyes to Melitta on the Balcony. She sets 
  food and wine for Batiatus, Lucretia and Titus. Melitta 
  catches the look, quickly shifts her gaze. Gannicus 
  tightens, his pain replaced by the hot sting of anger.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Barca! Bring fucking spear to 
                        purpose.

  Barca complies, somewhat lackluster. Gannicus lays into him. 
  Titus takes note from the balcony.

                                        TITUS

  Titus half chuckles, half coughs.

                        Sound and pallor threaten 
                          disagreement. You have been too 
                        long from salt air of the coast.

                        I would not see you so far removed.  
                        But perhaps a day or more by the 
                        waters of Neapolis...?

  Melitta returns with the honeyed wine. Lucretia takes it and 
  quickly pours a cup for Titus. [NOTE: Lucretia must pour the 
  wine herself.]

                        Then let our journey serve dual 
                        cause.  We can review the latest 
                        shipment of slaves while there, 
                        with mind towards procuring a 
                        champion favored by us both.  
                        Someone to rival Vettius  new 
                        man...?

  Titus is seized by a minor fit of coughing. Lucretia presses 
  the honeyed wine into his hands.

                      To your advantage. Make 
                        preparation. We leave for Neapolis.

  Titus exits. Batiatus grins, whispering to Lucretia.

                      He is attended to as promised. Have

                        set aside by words of a woman.

  Batiatus sees the point of that.

  Batiatus kisses her and moves inside. OFF LUCRETIA, her own 
  concerns far from assuaged...



  A bustling street, vibrantly colored with MERCHANTS and 
  their wares brought in from every corner of the Republic. In 
  the distance we see SHIPS docked in the harbor, the setting 
  sun framing their sails. ADJUST TO FIND Titus and Batiatus

                        beyond reason.

  Titus laughs, pleased.

                                        TITUS
                      My son speaks truth. You offer us 
                        piss and claim it wine.

                                        SLAVE TRADER
                        You will find none better in 
                        Neapolis.

                                        TITUS
                                  snorts)(
                        I but hope your city s drink holds 
                        higher standard.

  Titus clasps Batiatus  shoulder.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Come, let us seek libation to wash 
                        taste of shit from mouth.

  They head off, WIPING US TO --



  The sun is just starting to crest. TWO GUARDS carry Gaia s 
  body over to the edge of the cliff. No ceremony. Almost as 
  if they were dumping garbage.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Wait.

  They glance back to find Lucretia approaching. She goes to 
  Gaia, tears filling her eyes. She brushes the hair from 
  Gaia s face... gently kisses her lips one last time... nods 
  to the Guards.

  THE GUARDS

  drop Gaia s body over the cliff. They turn to go.

  LUCRETIA

  steps to the edge, grief constricting her heart as she 
  stares down into the vast sea of black. Gaia s body 
  somewhere in its depths.

  SLOWLY PULL BACK,

  down into the shadows, Lucretia dwindling high above. 
  Standing small and alone...

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK.
