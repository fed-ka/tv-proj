  EXT./INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY11

  FROM POV OF A HAND-HELD VIDEO CAMERA from inside the house... 
  A car pulls up.  JOHN SANTOS, 30, Latino, dress shirt (no 
  tie), slacks, cellphone on belt (think Radio Shack manager), 
  gets out, a six-pack of beer under his arm.  He walks across 
  the lawn, circles around to the back door... 

  NOW FROM POV OF  DATELINE -style fixed surveillance video 
    cameras... we see Santos enter.  HEAVY METAL ON THE STEREO.  
  Santos moves through the house, looking around.

                              JOHN SANTOS
                Hey.  It s John.  You here...?

  No answer.  He spies a note on the fridge tacked up by a 
  magnet:   Chill out.  I m in the shower.   Santos smiles.  He 
  notices steam coming from under the bathroom door down the 
  hall, hears the shower.  He pops a beer, calls toward the 
  bathroom:

                              JOHN SANTOS (cont'd)
                You want some company?

  He starts to unbutton his shirt, move toward the bathroom.  A 
  SHADOW falls across the floor.  He turns.  TRANSITIONING NOW 
  TO OBJECTIVE FILM POV... A BASEBALL BAT comes at him.  It 
  clocks him, sends him to the carpet, unconscious...  HANDS IN 
  HEAVY GLOVES duct-tape his legs, drag him to a CHAIR. CUT TO:

  CHARLIE enters, carrying a briefcase, looks around...

                              LARRY
                Behind you, Charles...

  He turns to see LARRY on an inversion table, inverted.

                              CHARLIE
                What are you doing?

                              LARRY 
                  ...Preparing myself for the event 
                horizon of a new perspective.

                              CHARLIE
                I guess that makes two of us...
                      (off Larry s inverted look)
                I know I haven t been exactly 
                supportive of your decision to sit 
                atop a Roman candle and blast off 
                into the unknown--

                              LARRY
                --If an apology is coming, Charles, 
                your launch window is closing fast.

  Larry swings back to vertical, extricates...

                              CHARLIE
                Look, I ve done some soul-searching 
                and... I think it s great that 
                you re pursuing your dream.

                              LARRY
                  I appreciate that.

                              CHARLIE
                But I am going to miss you.

                              LARRY
                It s only six months.  And while I 
                will be 250 miles above the earth, 
                  travelling at 18,000 miles per

                              CHARLIE
                --Open it.

  Larry takes the gift bag, opens it to find... a faded T-shirt 
  -- his shirt.

                              LARRY
                This is my shirt, Charles.  Which I 
                entrusted to you for safekeeping.

                              CHARLIE
                Look, I just thought...  You re 
                  rocketing into space, Larry.  
                There s no downside to packing a 
                lucky shirt.

                Victim #1 -- Scott Tillman, 40, 
                teacher, family man from Mar Vista.  
                Murdered six weeks ago in Westwood.

                Killed in Glendale ten days ago.

                The three houses were listed with 
                three different real estate 
                  companies.  No connection there.

                They went willingly, drove

55EXT. FBI OFFICE - BRIDGE - DAY   

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUMPER: FIND Don, David, Colby on the move.

                              COLBY
                This guy s definitely got his own 
                  playbook.  Most serial killers 
                stalk their victims or take them 
                home to do the deed.

                              DAVID
                But he s doing neither.  He lures 
                them to these houses. 

                              DON
                Which means our killer doesn t just 
                have access to houses for sale.  He 
                has access to information.

                              COLBY
                ...He knows which houses are empty.  
                And when.

                              DAVID
                Sounds like we re looking for a real 
                estate agent, maybe a contractor.

                              DON
                      (beat, working the facts)
                But how does he get these guys to 
                the houses?

                              COLBY
                      (checking his notes)
                Bank records show right before the 
                murders all three victims withdrew 
                money from an ATM.

                              DAVID
                Maybe he s baiting them -- drugs?

                              COLBY
                ...Or something else.  Second 
                victim, Jared Holt?  Had a 
                  solicitation rap two years ago. Got 
                busted with a hooker in Hollywood.

                We were married 16 years.

  TILT UP TO FIND: ELAINE TILLMAN, fragile, but with an inner 
  strength.  She looks to Megan --

                              ELAINE TILLMAN (cont'd)

                      (blanches at the news)
                Tomorrow it ll be six weeks to the 
                day.  It s been hardest on the 
                kids.  Tom cries every morning, 
                wants his Daddy.  But Susan s the 
                one I really worry about -- she 
                doesn t cry at all.

                              MEGAN
                I m sorry to put you through this 
                again.

                              ELAINE TILLMAN
                It s okay.  It s just, I m not sure 
                what more I can tell you.

                              MEGAN
                Well, we ve found some 
                  commonalities between the murders.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)NUMB3RS   #311/48   "Killer Chat"  BUFF REV  11-08-06     10.

                  Commonalities?

                              MEGAN
                Before your husband was murdered, 
                he withdrew some money from an ATM--

                                ELAINE TILLMAN
                Money?

                              MEGAN
                Few hundred dollars.

                                ELAINE TILLMAN
                You think that could be significant?

                              MEGAN
                We re not sure.  I m just wondering 
                what he might have been doing at 
                the house... Why he d get money....

                                ELAINE TILLMAN 
                I told you...  We moved here a year 
                ago.  We needed a house fast, bought 
                this one sight unseen.  We d talked 
                about getting a bigger place--

                              MEGAN
                Seems pretty unusual he d be there 
                alone.

                                ELAINE TILLMAN
                Scott made most of our financial 
                  decisions, so if he thought we 
                should buy a house...  Plus my 
                birthday was coming up... The only 
                thing I can think of is that he 
                wanted to surprise me. 
                      (beat, wistful look)
                Some birthday present, huh?

                They say a house has personality. 
                We re just... quantifying it.

                              LARRY
                Imagine a tortured psyche avenging 
                some childhood slight -- he chooses 
                houses that remind him of where he 
                grew up, completes the circle...

                              CHARLIE
                Very  Hitchcock,  Larry.

                I d say very  Megan.   You two have

                your minds are melding.

                We ve been maximizing the hours, 
                given that soon we ll be limited to 
                more... creative communication.

                              AMITA
                You better be careful, Larry.  I 
                hear that NASA usually listens in 
                on its satellite communications...

  On Larry,

                              LARRY
                I was unable to secure CalSci s 
                  Celestron, so Megan and I ve 
                devised a new arrangement.  I ll be 
                able to look down on her.  Now she 
                can look up at me. 

  Larry smiles, his ebullience evident.  His cell RINGS.  He

                  According to Millie, some unnamed 
                rival of Larry s at an unnamed 
                  institute in Massachusetts lobbied 
                for an eleventh hour background 
                check.  It seems some of his recent

                NASA called her, Charlie.  Not the 
                other way around.  She didn t want

                I ran the victims  phone logs, 
                credit cards.  They didn t go to

                their internet service providers.  
                So far, not looking good.

  They ENTER THE BULLPEN... to FIND Megan at her desk.

                              DON
                So we re back to square one.

                              MEGAN
                Maybe not completely.

                              DON
                You got something.

                              MEGAN
                I called Child and Family Services  
                about Victim #3, John Santos.   

                              DAVID
                The guy with the sealed juvie record.

                              MEGAN
                Age seven he was removed from his 
                home on suspicion of sexual abuse.
                      (off their looks)
                What do we know statistically about 
                victims of sexual abuse?

                              DON
                A lot of them go on to become 
                abusers, themselves.

                              MEGAN
                Which is why I took a fresh look at 
                the rest of our victims.

  She picks up another file, reads...

                              MEGAN (cont'd)
                Victim #2, Jared Holt...  We knew 
                about his solicitation rap.  What 
                we didn t know was the prostitute 
                was underage.  Fourteen.  Lawyer 
                got the rape charge dismissed.

                What about Victim #1, the teacher?

                              MEGAN
                His wife told me they d recently 
                moved.  Fact is they ve moved a 
                lot.  Five schools in seven 
                years... No comment from any of the  
                school s administrators--

                              DON
                But we can read between the lines.

                              MEGAN
                Which means we got a guy soliciting 
                an underage prostitute, a teacher 
                messing with kids and a victim of 
                sexual abuse who very likely may ve 
                been an offender himself...

                      (entering now)
                I just got off the phone with the 
                victims  ISPs.  There was nothing 
                in their e-mails, but there were 
                records of visits to chatrooms.  
                Dozens of sites...

                Maybe they took it a step further 
                than talk.

  Megan looks at Don...

                              MEGAN
                And maybe that s the reason they 
                died.

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUMPER: Don, Megan, Colby run the facts.

                              DON
                Alright, so we have a killer who s 
                going after sex-offenders...  

                              MEGAN
                Combined with the brutality of the 
                murders, it suggests one motive...

                              DON
                Revenge. 

                              MEGAN
                  Something happened in the past, 
                killer s getting payback now.

                              COLBY
                So he s likely a victim of abuse--

                              MEGAN
                --Or connected to one.  A family 
                member, daughter, sister...

                Only connection all these victims 
                have is the internet, right?

                      (follows, realizing)
                The chatrooms... He lures them 
                through the chatrooms. 

                              DON
                We need transcripts of all the chats.

                              COLBY
                On it...

                              MEGAN
                If the killer s meeting these 
                victims online, he s gotta be 
                leaving an electronic trail.

                              DON
                So we look for someone they all 
                talked with; a username they all 
                chatted with in common.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)NUMB3RS   #311/48   "Killer Chat"  BUFF REV  11-08-06     19.

1212INT. TILLMAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY   

  Megan observes, as Elaine Tillman cleans up the mess from her 
  kids  breakfast (cereal, spilled milk, etc).  A stoic vibe...

                Sorry for the mess.  I just got the

  Megan measures Elaine, her eyes locked on...

                              MEGAN
                Your internet service provider gave 
                us a list of chatrooms your husband 
                visited -- they were more suited to 
                the interests of a 14-year old girl 
                than a 40-year-old man...
                      (off Elaine s tense look)
                We know why your husband was at 
                that house that night, Mrs. 
                  Tillman... I think you do, too.

                                ELAINE TILLMAN
                I m sorry.  I can t help you.

                      (taking a harder line)
                All those years, moving cities, 
                changing schools...  You have 
                children -- how could you continue 
                to protect him?

                              ELAINE TILLMAN
                My husband and I were married for 
                16 years -- I have a family.  You 
                think I could throw it all away?
                      (caving, tears flowing)
                He tried counseling, promised me 
                he d stop...

                              MEGAN 
                But he didn t, did he?   

  Megan eyes the photo of their kids; Elaine reacts.

                                ELAINE TILLMAN 
                He told me, swore to me he d never 
                touched the kids.

                someone he thought was a young 
                girl.  That s why he went to that 
                house; to meet her...

                If you know anything... saw a name,

                You protected him once and look 
                what happened... Keeping yourself 
                in denial now is only going to 
                protect his killer.

  Off Elaine s look -- devastated, failed as wife and mother.

  EXT. CAMPUS - LUNCH TABLE - DAY1313

                By now I can distinguish between 
                  Professor Charles Eppes puzzling 
                over a math problem and Charlie 
                Eppes worrying about a friend.

                      (beat, off her look)

                mean, a little while ago I was in 
                total denial that he was leaving...

  Another beat, as Charlie struggles with his emotions --

                Worst part is, I convinced myself I

                      (then)
                To think I was glad that my best

                That you re human.  That you care 
                about Larry... When it comes to 
                emotions, maybe Professor Eppes has 
                to cut Charlie Eppes a little slack.

                enough on your plate without --

                              MEGAN
                You don t like the wine?

                              LARRY
                It s an excellent choice.  Stopping 
                at half a glass merely eliminates 
                the potential risk of descending

                These chats are from three months 
                ago.  Look, I tried to set them up, 
                have them arrested.  But they 
                didn t take the bait.
                      (beat, holds Don s look)
                Maybe someone at the group hijacked 
                my username... whoever killed these 
                men, it wasn t me.

  Don walks with Brendan McCrary.  

                              BRENDAN MCCRARY
                My son called my wife.  That was an 
                hour ago.  She must be here by now.

                              DON
                I had her escorted her up.  She and 
                your son are waiting in the lounge.

  McCrary looks toward the Coffee Lounge where COLLEEN McCRARY, 
  39, soccer mom, and son Matt are waiting.  The McCrarys make 
  eye contact.  Colleen jumps to her feet and hurries over, 
  Matt in tow.  Brendan McCrary looks to Don.

                              BRENDAN MCCRARY

                FBI was questioning you about some

                C mon, Colleen.  Let s go home.

  The McCrary Family turns and exits as...

  Colby, holding a print-out (having seen the exchange with the 
  McCrarys), comes from the Elevator Area, picking his way 
  through the crowd.  He glances at the McCrary s exiting --

                              COLBY
                ...Don t think this is gonna help 
                your mood any either.

  As Don and Colby move down the hallway...

                              COLBY (cont'd)
                McCrary s story checks out.  Local 
                police confirm three months ago he 
                tried to lure the victims to a 
                house, but they didn t go for it.  
                So he sent them a letter instead.

                              DON
                A letter?

                              COLBY
                  Notification they d attempted 
                explicit sexual conversations with 
                a minor.  He threatened to  out  
                them to their families if they 
                didn t go into counseling.
                      (beat)
                McCrary also has an alibi for the 
                last murder.

  Don registers this, sees Charlie and Amita approaching --

                              DON

  (NOTE: TECH has TWO COMPUTER SCREENS; plus Charlie has his 
  computer for his math).  Charlie looks up, sees Don entering.

                I ve got the algorithm set to scan 
                the site the killer s been 
                  uploading to.  As soon as we get a

                I think he likes the distraction.

  Megan enters to find Larry reading a Shakespeare play --

                      (checking the play)
                  Shakespeare?   All s Well That Ends 
                Well  -- this mean you re trying to

                I ve been seeking a credo to get me 
                through.  My first instinct was 
                 screw your courage to the mast.   
                But then I thought, screw that.

                              MEGAN
                So did Shakespeare come through?

                 Our remedies oft in ourselves do 
                lie.  Which we ascribe to heaven.  
                The fated sky gives us free scope, 
                only doth backward pull our slow 
                designs when we ourselves are dull. 

  He looks up from the book...

                              LARRY (cont'd)
                Soaring into the heavens was my 
                ambition.  It s clear now that it 
                was an Icarus illusion...  The 
                fated sky is telling me something -- 
                it s time to stop reaching for 
                what s beyond my grasp.

                I ve been on the phone 40 minutes;  
                I need to speak with Dr. York--yes, 
                about Lawrence Fleinhardt--Okay, 
                well I guess you re the person I 
                need to talk to.  Look, here s the 
                thing-- I ve known Larry Fleinhardt 
                since I was 14.  And I admit he s 
                an eccentric, and you have 
                  concerns.  But the man s brilliant, 
                and maybe the kindest, most decent 
                person I know.  And if it were my 2 
                billion dollars and I were going on 
                this mission, I d want no one else 
                in the seat beside me...  Yes.  I 
                am personally vouching for him...  
                  I appreciate that.  Yeah, I guess 
                that is all I have to say.

  INT. MCCRARY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT3838

  CLOSE ON MATT McCRARY, seated across the dining room table 
  from Don.  His parents, Brendan and Colleen McCrary, are 
  present.  Don slides a list of names and transcripts across.

                              DON 
                This was on your laptop, Matt.  
                Only it s not schoolwork.  It s a 
                list of names of sexual predators, 
                logs of chatroom conversations.

                              BRENDAN MCCRARY
                They say you downloaded it from my 
                computer -- is that right?

  No response.  Not even making eye contact...

                              DON
                Four names from your dad s list... 
                all four murdered.  Your father 
                didn t do it.  You were the only 
                other source of this information, 
                so how is it these men are dead?  

                              BRENDAN MCCRARY
                      (off the boy s silence)
                Agent Eppes asked you a question.

                              MATT MCCRARY
                I didn t kill anyone.

                              DON
                But you know who the killer is, 
                don t you...  Because you helped 
                him.

  Matt looks at Don now -- Don s struck a chord of truth.  Don 
  spies a FAMILY PHOTO (including DAUGHTER KATIE) on the wall.  

                              DON (cont'd)
                You don t think I understand but I 
                do.  You wanted to get back at guys 
                like the one who hurt your sister.  
                I want to hurt them, too.  But that 
                makes us no better than they are...  

  Don s words crack Matt s shell.  Tears for the first time.

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUMPER: Don, Megan and David...

                              DAVID
                We checked Elaine Tillman s e-mail.  
                Over the past three months she s 
                  contacted a half-dozen real estate 
                  agencies.

                              MEGAN
                She said she and her husband were 
                looking to buy a bigger house...

                              DAVID
                She used different names to contact 
                the real estate agents, make the 
                  appointments.

                              DON 
                Where is she now?

                              DAVID 
                Two hours ago, she left her kids at a 
                  neighbor s.  Said her mom was sick, 
                she had to take her to the hospital.

                              MEGAN
                ...She s lined up her next victim.

                              DON
                      (beat, working the facts)
                These listings you found in her e-
                mail... how many houses were there?

                              DAVID
                Almost a hundred.

                              DON
                Let s get the list to Charlie.

                              CHARLIE
                I mapped the locations of all the 
                houses from Elaine Tillman s list.
                Assuming our killer sticks to her 
                M.O. of live uploads, she ll need a 
                strong WIFI connection.

                              DON
                Last time she sent us to the wrong 
                house.

                              CHARLIE
                --And she ll try to do it again.  
                Only this time, we ll know where 
                she s transmitting from.

                              DON
                How?

                              CHARLIE
                When I did my real estate analysis, 
                one thing I looked at was WIFI 
                  connectivity.  I had the Techs 
                  cross-check the database of 
                  broadband users in these areas 
                against owners of WIFI routers--

                              MEGAN
                --Sounds like a lot of houses.

                              CHARLIE
                Yes, but not where we re looking.

  Charlie now punches up his previous map showing Jessica s Law 
   hot-zones  split-screened with the map of house locations...

                              CHARLIE (cont'd)
                Remember our killer was selecting 
                houses in these Jessica s Law  hot-
                  zones ...  Overlaying these hot-
                zones on our map of houses...

  Charlie hits the remote: the two maps overlay; simplifying 
  down to 5 BLUE X S now in 5 RED HOT-ZONES.

                              CHARLIE (cont'd)
                  Factoring in WIFI connectivity, 
                I ve isolated five locations where 
                the killer will likely strike.

  bloodied, stares out at us with frightened eyes.  PAN OFF THE 
  LAPTOP SCREEN to find VICTIM #5 lashed with duct tape to a 
  chair; a VIDEO CAMERA there.  Elaine Tillman stands over him.

                              VICTIM #5

  Her eyes are filled with hatred and, in this moment, control. 
  She cuts the last of the duct tape with a kitchen knife as... 

  ELAINE S POV:

  THE FRONT DOOR SPLINTERS OPEN.  SHOUTS OF  FBI!  FBI!   
  Megan, David and the SWAT TEAM surge into the room, guns out.  
  ANOTHER SWAT TEAM enters from the back.  But Elaine has the 
  drop on her victim, behind him.  Kitchen knife to his throat.  

                                ELAINE TILLMAN (cont'd)
                One more step, he s dead...

                              MEGAN
                Easy, Elaine.  No one moves, until 
                you and I talk.

                              ELAINE TILLMAN
                --About what?  You know why I m 
                here.  You know what I have to do--

                              MEGAN 
                Put the knife down.  Look, I know 
                what happened.  I know your husband 
                hurt your daughter--

                      (through anguished tears)
                I have to stop them.  Go ahead and 
                shoot, I m still gonna kill him--

                              MEGAN
                Listen to me.  We know why he came 
                here.  We have proof, on his own 
                  computer, his words.  He s not 
                walking out of here a free man.

  Elaine s resolve is weakening.  Megan s almost got her --



                                                                          (CONTINUED)NUMB3RS   #311/48   "Killer Chat"  BUFF REV  11-08-06     56.

                prison will be worse than anything

  Beat.  Elaine drops the knife, crumbles under the weight of 
  the guilt she s been carrying.  A SWAT TEAM MEMBER takes her 
  into custody, as VICTIM #5 looks to Megan and David, shaken.

  Dialogue as it appears in script:

                               WENDELL HENDERSON
                My name is Wendell Henderson.  I 
                came to this house to have sex with 
                  a 15-year-old girl. In the past ten 
                years, I ve molested over 40 young 
                girls, some as young as 11...

    Additional dialogue to continue under action sequence that 
  follows:

                              WENDELL HENDERSON (cont'd)
                ...I understand that I can never 
                give these children their lives 
                back.  What I ve taken from them 
                cannot be replaced or restored.  
                I ve stolen from them their trust 
                and their innocence.  I ve 
                  destroyed them and their families.  
                I ask forgiveness from these young 
                girls and from their parents for 
                the pain and suffering I ve caused 
                them.
