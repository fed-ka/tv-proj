A blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a
subway tunnel. Most are Japanese. We're not in Kansas.

Standing in the middle of the rush-hour pedestrian traffic is
KAREN (20s, American). She faces upstream, looking for
someone. The flow threatens to carry her away in a
heartbeat. She looks fragile, intimidated by the madness.
DOUG (O.S.)
Karen!
She turns to see her boyfriend DOUG (20s, American)
approaching. With a reassuring smile he takes her hand --
-- and together, they force their way through the throng,
trying to escape the flow. They're jostled and crushed by
the crowd, and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer.
KAREN
I'll never get used to this.
DOUG
Maybe we should find a different
train station.
He abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still
holding Karen's hand. She turns, wondering what's going on.
She sees the smile on his lips a moment before --
-- he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her. As if the
crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all.
It's tender and loving, and she responds... at first.
But
then she pulls away, shy.
KAREN
A public display of affection is
considered rude in Japan.
There's an opening ahead into a SIDE STREET.
Doug and Karen
deftly slip out of the traffic --

-- and walk hand-in-hand down the much quieter street, away
from the crowded thoroughfare.
Doug smiles as they pass by two JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL COUPLES,
making out on the street corner. He turns to give Karen a
sarcastic look --

-- but she didn't notice the school kids. She's looking in
the other direction, at a trickle of SMOKE wafting up over a
nearby fence.
KAREN
What's that?
Doug follows as she walks toward an OLD TEMPLE, nestled
beneath a skyscraper. A collision of the ancient and modern.
The fence surrounds a GRAVEYARD adjacent to the temple.
DOUG
We walk past this temple every day,
Karen --
KAREN
Yeah, but I've never seen this
before.
A JAPANESE MAN stands before an ornate headstone, lighting a
bundle of incense and bowing before the grave.
KAREN
It's a Buddhist ritual. The
incense smoke carries the prayers
to the spirits of his ancestors, to
help them remain at peace.
CLINK. She turns as Doug, grinning, lights a cigarette with
his Zippo, flicking it shut and pocketing it.
DOUG
It's amazing. You're like this
infinite storehouse of wisdom. Or
trivia. I'm not sure which.
KAREN
It's not trivia. It's what they
believe. And it's far better, by
the way, than your little pollution
ritual.
Doug's grin softens to a smile. He doesn't respond... but
the way he's looking at Karen makes her curious:
KAREN
What?
He turns away for a moment, almost shyly, dropping his
cigarette and crushing it. Finally:

DOUG
Nothing. I just -- I like that
about you. You seem to be able to
remember everything that's really
important.
She smiles.
A tender moment.
Then... he checks his watch.
DOUG
Except the time.
Karen checks her own watch, realizing --
KAREN
Oh, crap --
She grabs his hand and starts to walk quickly.
KAREN
C'mon, you're gonna be late.

Karen and Doug approach the doors of a NURSING CARE CENTER.
She pulls him to the side just as he's stepping under a
WORKMAN'S LADDER by the doors.
KAREN
Uh-uh. Seven years of bad luck.
(before Doug can respond:)
And I might have a vested interest
in those years.
DOUG
Is that right?
KAREN
Maybe.
Doug smiles, kissing her romantically.
Then:
DOUG
Will I see you tonight?
KAREN
I'll call you when I get home.
With a flourish, Doug SWINGS HIMSELF back under the ladder.
DOUG

I hate odd numbers.

Karen walks down the populated sidewalk, weaving through
STREET VENDORS, and passing a large GROCERY STORE.
She pauses, looking at the address on her card. She
approaches a WOMAN and her DAUGHTER (6) and speaks to them in
Japanese. The woman nods, pointing towards a small ALLEY.
Karen gives the daughter a smile;
the girl hides behind her
mother's leg.

Karen exits the alley, entering a quiet, narrow street.
She's still not sure if she's in the right place.
But then her eyes fix on something. She begins to walk
towards it, her gaze never leaving it --

-- it's THE HOUSE.
Cozy and shaded, nestled into the dead
end of the street.
Large by Tokyo standards.
She double-checks the address and opens the gate, walking
around a BICYCLE leaning against the wall and following the
stepping-stone path to the front door. She knocks. No
answer. She tries again. Nothing.
Then, an afterthought, she tries the handle.
It's unlocked.

KAREN
Okay, Emma. Let's try again: my
name is Karen. Do you remember?
I'm from the Health Center. I'm
substituting for Yoko, just for
today.
Emma doesn't respond -- and there's no indication that she
remembers Karen introducing herself before.
Kneeling in front of Emma, Karen notices a BAND-AID around
one of her fingers. Blood has soaked through it.
KAREN
Looks like you need a new Band-Aid.
How'd this happen, Emma?
(still no reaction)
Would you like a bath? Maybe that
will help you feel better.
Emma doesn't even turn towards her.

Karen uses a sponge to bathe Emma, her robe rolled to her

The door opens and Matthew walks outside, stopping to look at
a familiar BICYCLE, leaning against the house near the door.
MATTHEW
Is this Yoko's bike?
JENNIFER
I think so.
MATTHEW
It's been here all night.
Matthew rolls the bike from the porch to the gate, leaning it
against the wall (where we saw it earlier).
He turns back to Jennifer, giving her a kiss.
MATTHEW
I'll probably be home late, maybe
around nine or so.
Jennifer gives him a look.
JENNIFER
I knew you'd forget.
Matthew pauses, looks back blankly.
Jennifer just smiles.
JENNIFER
Dinner, your sister?
At seven?
MATTHEW
Oh yeah.
Right.
JENNIFER
You were going to cook.
MATTHEW
I have a big conference.
They
usually run long.
Jennifer rolls her eyes.

It's an overcast afternoon.
Swollen clouds hang low over
The House. It looks a bit more imposing than usual.
THE MAILBOX is adorned with the Japanese equivalent of a "For
Sale" sign -- weather-worn, and looks like it's been there
for years.
SUZUKI (30s, Japanese), a Real Estate agent, waits by the
gate. Then he notices something. Waves, and smiles.
It's SUSAN, approaching with MATTHEW, JENNIFER and EMMA.
Susan shakes Suzuki's hand and they exchange a greeting in
Japanese. She turns to her brother.
SUSAN
This is Suzuki-san, he's the Real
Estate broker.
Suzuki bows at Matthew and Jennifer, says something.
MATTHEW
What did he say?
SUSAN
He said: "welcome to Tokyo". And
that you must be very important to
your company for them to rent this
place for you.

Two POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE are parked out front.
An UNMARKED CAR pulls up, and DETECTIVE NAKAGAWA (40s) exits
the passenger side. He looks up at The House with dread.
The driver, DETECTIVE IGARASHI (30s), moves next to him.
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
I can handle this myself, you know.
It's just a routine call. I don't
know why you wanted to come.
He turns to Nakagawa, awaiting a response. He doesn't get
one. Nakagawa just stares up at The House.

Nakagawa stands outside by the front gate, looking at --

He looks down at it, frowning.
Then he suddenly cocks his head.
As if sensing something.
He turns to look up at A WINDOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR.
It's empty.

The POLICE CARS outside have attracted a small crowd.
The
TWO BODIES are being loaded into a POLICE VAN.
Nakagawa stands with THE CORONER. The CORONER'S ASSISTANT,
wearing a face mask and rubber gloves, approaches. He holds
something small, wrapped in a bloody white sheet.
The Coroner slowly unfolds the sheet. We can't see what he's
looking at -- but it elicits quite a reaction.
CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
Who does this belong to?
NAKAGAWA
(IN JAPANESE)
We don't know.
The Coroner quickly re-covers the object.
CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
I can use the blood to help
identify the person.
As the Coroner and his assistant walk away:
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
Is it possible that someone could
live without... that?
The Coroner turns back, his face pale.

Nakagawa turns away to see Igarashi approaching, talking into
a cell phone. He looks disturbed. As he hangs up:
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
Someone just reported another
death. It's not in our district...
but I think we should check it out.
Nakagawa realizes something's troubling his partner.
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
Why?
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
The cause of death is not clear...
but it is the man who sold them
this house.

CLOSE ON the spinning wheels of a bicycle.

The pedals are being pumped by a beautiful young Japanese
woman -- this is YOKO (early 20s).
Yoko turns, riding down a small side street.
It ends, and

Yoko opens the gate and walks her bike to the front door,

plastic LABEL on it.

Monolithic
against a cloudy, bleak sky.
Karen stands before it, staring up at it.
Then she walks to the intercom and looks at the directory,
finds `M. Kirk'. She activates the intercom and dials the
number. It rings a few times, and then a voice picks up:
MARIA (INTERCOM, IN JAPANESE)
Yes?
KAREN
I'm looking for Maria Kirk?
MARIA (INTERCOM)
Who is this?
KAREN
My name is Karen Davies. I'm a
student at -- I'm sorry to bother
you, but I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions.

Karen stares at the intercom.
KAREN
Ms. Kirk?
MARIA (INTERCOM)
Questions about what?
KAREN
I'm here because... I need to speak
with you about your husband.
When Maria's voice comes back through the intercom, she
sounds different, shaken:
MARIA (INTERCOM)
Leave me alone.
KAREN
Maria --

Please.
Karen stands there for a moment.

Peter stands in front of The House.
He glances down at the BLUE ENVELOPE in his hand. He stuffs
it in his pocket, unsure about what he's going to do.
Then he opens the gate and goes in, walking to the front
door. Knocks. Silence from inside. He rings the bell.
Waits. No one comes. He's about to leave --
But then he hears something from around the side of the
house. It sounded like a muffled SPLASH of water.

house. They look disembodied, mottled and bruised.

staring eyes don't seem to notice Peter, standing right in
front of him.

Hello.
No reaction. There's definitely something wrong with this
boy. Peter looks beyond him, into the dark house.
PETER (IN JAPANESE)
My name is Peter. I'm here to see
your mother. Is she home?
The boy slowly straightens. His eyes focus on Peter. Then
he FALLS BACKWARDS. Startled, Peter tries to see inside:

Hey!

Peter quickly goes back to the front door.

KAREN. She's lying on a gurney, regaining consciousness.
Japanese EMTS are speaking to her as she's being loaded into
the back of an ambulance.
KAREN'S POV: the blurry forms of FIREMEN rush by in slow
motion. Everything is dizzy and incoherent...
Karen tries to sit up -- but a YOUNG EMT lays a gentle hand
on her arm, deftly sliding a needle under her skin. The
sedative takes hold almost immediately.
Karen sinks back into the gurney, her eyes rolling back in

KAYAKO. Beautiful and meek. She's smiling, walking hand-in-
hand with TAKEO. A happy couple.
As they reach the front door and go inside, Kayako turns back
to the front gate. She smiles and gestures, "come on".
And then TOSHIO walks forward, through the gate.
His
attention is on a tiny BLACK KITTEN in his arms.
At the door, Toshio turns to look back over his shoulder --
-- DIRECTLY AT KAREN. They hold each other's gaze for a
moment, as if he somehow sees her in the ambulance.
Then Kayako gestures to Toshio, and he turns away, entering
The House and closing the door.
