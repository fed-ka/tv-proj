We sneak between curtain and window ledge into a home office
fitted out with a flat screen TV and a computer.
Scene 3 Page 2
KENNETH, a forty something ex-jock with a once handsome face,
pours a beer into a crystal brandy glass. Kenneth's eyes are
glued to the computer screen where stock numbers scroll
endlessly down. He highlights a set of numbers and stands up
abruptly from his chair elated.
KENNETH
Yes!
Steps back onto a A CHILD'S DOLL, crushing it underfoot. His
ebullient mood changes quickly.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Damn! DELLA!
The sound of footsteps are followed by the door opening.
DELLA peers into the room. She's a diminutive blonde in her
thirties with fine features and a fading Southern accent.
She's pulling a coat on over a white shirt and jeans.
She sees the broken doll.
DELLA
SHOOT, KENNETH! That's Tammi's
favorite doll.
She walks in, picks up the doll and tries to fix its squashed
face. He turns back to the computer guiltily, takes a sip of
beer.
KENNETH
You should just swear properly and
get it over with. Do you think the
kids don't know what you mean?
Close up, his face is ruddy - the face of someone who drinks
too much. He turns back towards her. She ignores him,
continues to try fix the doll. His eyes linger on her coat.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Going out again? What is it
tonight? Auto Mechanics for
Dummies? The bored housewives'
reading group?
He averts his eyes back to the screen then turns back to look
at her once more.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
I got a new one for you.
He smiles sardonically.
Scene 3 Page 3
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Group therapy for women who always
have the curse. There's a Tuesday
night class at the Pleasant Valley
Episcopalian.
Kenneth clearly thinks he's funny. Della glares a warning at
him and bites her lip to stop a vitriolic response escaping
from her mouth.
DELLA
I'm going to the mall for wrapping
paper.
A trail of kids mess in the hallway behind Della catches
Kenneth's eye.
KENNETH
What do you do all day, Della
honey? Cause it sure isn't keeping
house. This place is an eyesore.
I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs
for this?
His sad eyes meet hers in confrontation. Della, determined
not to engage, averts hers. Kenneth, unable to contain
himself, faces her.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
I mean it's not like you're at some
salon fancying up your hair or
nails like the other men's wives.
He lifts a strand of her limp fair hair and lets it drop,
looks right in her tired face.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
The last time I saw you wearing
something sexy was our engagement
party. God, Della, you used to be
hot!
She bites her lip again, but this time to try stop the tears.
He turns away, in an attempt to conceal his own sadness.
She walks away clutching the doll.
DELLA
Put the twins to bed by eight. Give
them a chocolate cookie with their
milk.
Scene 3 Page 4
KENNETH
Jesus, Della. Della honey, I'm
sorry.
But she's already left the room. He watches her pick up a set
of car keys from a dresser in the dimly lit hallway. Her
knuckles are white as she clenches her fingers around them.
Kenneth turns back to his computer.

Della climbs the stairs. Framed photographs on the wall tell
the public story of her life. The engagement to Kenneth,
their wedding, the birth of the twins, Kenneth's graduation,
Kenneth as a sixth grade football star, Della on the farm in
Ohio with her horse, a really young Della playing baseball
with her father. We linger on a photo of a very pretty twenty
something Della in a little black dress.

TERRI and TAMMI are seven year old twins with the delicate
blue eyed blonde looks of their Mother.
Della stands in the doorway and watches them.
Tammi is lying on her girlish bed drawing with crayons.
Terri's toy dinosaurs are destroying Tammi's heirloom dolls
house, starting with the furniture.
She steps into the room.
TAMMI
Mommy can I get an American Girl
for Christmas?
TERRI
I want a raptor dinosaur, Mommy.
DELLA
You better leave Santa a note. It's
only three days until Christmas.
She gives them each a kiss, breathing in their scent she
loves so much.
TAMMI
Where are you going, Mommy?
Scene 5 Page 5
DELLA
The Mall. One chocolate cookie each
and then Daddy will read you a
bedtime story.
TAMMI
Daddy's stories are lame. I want
you to read us a story.
TERRI
Yeah Mommy, the one about the
pirates.
TAMMI
No, the cowgirls. Diamond Lil and
Slingshot Kitty.
DELLA
Tomorrow night I'll read you the
best bedtime story in the whole
world. I promise.
Della gives them a little wave and turns to leave.
DELLA (CONT'D)
I'll check in on you both when I
get back.
(beat)
To make sure you're sleeping.
She smiles. Terri's already turned back to his dinosaurs.
Tammi runs toward her and gives her the drawing she's been
working on. It's a drawing of a stick figure family holding
hands. The words "Mommy, we love you" are written across a
cloudy night sky like big stars.
DELLA (CONT'D)
Thank you, Tammi, it's wonderful.
Della doesn't have time to look at it properly so she folds
the drawing up and puts it in her pocket. She kisses Tammi
again and turns to leave. Tammi's eyes follow her mother as
she walks away.

STAIRWAY - EVENING
Della checks her watch and hurries down the stairs.

HALLWAY - EVENING
She sits on the bottom stair to pull on a pair of boots. The
boots are well worn but polished to a gleam.
Scene 7 Page 6
Behind her, an antique grandfather clock strikes seven p.m.
The sound of gun shots fades in from the TV in Kenneth's
office.

Della collects a packet of cookies from a cabinet. She looks
at the pile of dirty dinner dishes in the sink then looks
away.

Della leaves the cookies at the bottom of the stairs and
opens the front door. The TV blares out some action flick
from Kenneth's ajar door.

FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
Della inserts the key and turns it in the lock.
The car
sputters in defiance against the cold night.
DELLA
Frick!
The car sputters again.
DELLA (CONT'D)
C'MON...
With a massive exertion, the car engine turns over and the
vehicle starts. She sighs with relief.
She turns the heat up high and warms her hands at the vent,
pauses to look at her home through the car window. For a
second, in an upstairs window, she sees a reflection of
Tammi.
She smiles, then looks at the house and lawn and the
Christmas tree. She notices the fallen star, is about to get
out of the car to retrieve it, but decides it's too cold.
Scene 11Page 7
A shadow creeps across her face as she pulls the stick into
reverse and backs up.
12
12
She slows down, rolls down her window and swipes a chub card
against the security panel. The gates slowly open. She drives
through. The gates close behind her. She rolls the window up
and makes a left turn onto.
15
15
Della smiles mysteriously, reaches into the glove compartment
with her free hand. She pushes aside a bunch of car papers, a
flare, pulls out a check wallet hidden underneath - her
secret hiding place for:
A nice pack of Marlboros. She smiles again - the smile of the
secret smoker. She presses the cigarette lighter into the
dashboard.
The lighter pops out. She tips out a cigarette, sees a
sticky note attached to the interior foil. Scrawled in messy
handwriting are the words - YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE QUITTING
DELLA HONEY. XOXO KENNETH.
DELLA
I'll get right on that Kenneth
honey. AFTER you stop drinking.
Scene 16Page 8
She rips the note off, stuffs it in her purse, lights the
cigarette.
She inhales deeply.
We see the pleasure written across her
face.
17
17
There is the familiar ring of a cellular phone. Della has
programmed one of those "oh so cute" recognizable tunes into
it, like the "William Tell overture".
Della holds the wheel with one hand and fumbles through her
purse with the other. She eventually locates the phone.
DELLA
Hello?
MARY (V.O.)
Della, it's Mary Messina.
Della rolls her eyes.
This is not a welcome call.
DELLA
Oh, hey.
MARY (V.O.)
You okay sweetie?
DELLA
Sure. How are you?
MARY (V.O.)
I'm well.
DELLA
How'd you get my cell number?
Della balances the phone while she drags on her cigarette.
MARY (V.O.)
I called Kenneth at the house.
Oh great.
She exhales sharply.
Scene 18Page 9
DELLA
And how'd that go? Did he give you
an earful for disturbing his ninety
ninth viewing of Lethal Weapon
Four?
Mary giggles.
MARY (V.O.)
Oh Della. Kenneth is always
charming. At least to me.
The car flashes past the decorated sign for a local school.
Before Della can stop herself, the words are out.
DELLA
Well, with the way you flaunt your
double D boob job at the free fun
PTA events that's hardly a
surprise.
Fortunately for her the phone happens to make a deep metallic
distortion at that moment.
MARY (V.O.)
What was that?
DELLA
Oh nothing, Mary.
MARY (V.O.)
You got lucky with that one.
Patricia Ellis says he's the best
looking guy in Pleasant Valley.
DELLA
Well that wouldn't be hard.
Mary, do you need something? Cause
I gotta go.
MARY (V.O.)
Yes, are you going to Tool School
tomorrow?
Mary giggles at her own joke.
Della sighs.
THIS is why she is having her serenity
interrupted?
Scene 18Page 10
DELLA
TOOL SCHOOL?, Ouch, Mary. Do It
Yourself Mechanics is without a
doubt the most interesting thing in
my life right now.
(Smiles)
I carry my beloved toolbox in the
trunk at all times.
The desolate road disappears behind Della.
She passes a
roadside memorial.
MARY (V.O.)
I'm just joking, Della. You know
me. I pre-paid ten classes and only
made it to two. If you are going I
could use a ride. I'd hate to miss
another class.
If Della was going before, she's not now.
DELLA
Sorry, Mary, I'm skipping this
week. Kenneth's parents are coming
to stay for Christmas. You know how
it is.
A red light looms ahead. Della slows.
MARY (V.O.)
Oh that's too bad. Maybe Patricia
Ellis will be going.
DELLA
You check with her, Mary.
MARY (V.O.)
Merry Christmas. God bless you and
your family.
Christmas lights outline a few distant houses.
DELLA
You too.
(Under her breath)
Bah Humbug.
MARY (V.O.)
Pardon?
DELLA
Bye, Mary.
Scene 18Page 11
Della stops at the red light. She clicks off the phone and
lets it lay on her lap.
She rakes about among a bunch of kids stuff in the back seat,
casts aside, an anorak, mittens, a sock.
She finds what she's looking for, a bottle of water, caught
on the bar under the passenger seat. It's only a third full
but she takes a sip, recoils from its coldness.
The light changes.
She throws the bottle into the back seat.

FORD EXPLORER - EVENING/ EXT CROSSROADS
Della picks up the phone and pushes a few keys. She has not
dialed enough to make a full phone call when we hear the
phone RING on the other side.
OPERATOR (V.O.)
Cellular 411 connect. How may I
direct your call?
DELLA
The Learning Academy. Spring
Street.
OPERATOR (V.O.)
Please hold for that number.
Della slows down for another red light.
She's at a wide crossroads where the housing development
abruptly ends and a wasteland of deforestation begins.
A billboard for another new housing development announces:
"GREEN STREET DREAM HOMES - Investment Opportunities".
Waiting for the light at the opposite side of the road from
Della is a car with an animal cadaver strapped to the roof.
Della tries not to look at it.
A recording breaks into the moment just as the light ahead
changes to green.
Scene 20Page 12
OPERATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(recording)
Press your pound key now to connect
with your request.
Della presses the pound key and drives straight ahead.
MEGHAN (V.O.)
Learning Academy, this is Meghan.
DELLA
Hi Meghan.
It's Della Myers.
MEGHAN (V.O.)
Oh hey. You calling about Spanish
for Beginners? You know that Tom
cancelled 'cause of New Year's.
DELLA
Yes I knew.
MEGHAN (V.O.)
Can you hold, I have another call?
DELLA
Okay.
Frustrated, Della turns on the radio.
It is some innocuous
local ad.
LOCAL AD
Pleasant Valley Dream Homes. The
lowest crime rate in the US. Call 1-
800-SAFE.
Della switches stations trying to find something she likes.
She gives up and waits for Meghan to return. The car flashes
past construction road signs.
MEGHAN (V.O.)
Sorry Della ...
DELLA
Can you leave word for Mike. I'm
going to miss tomorrow's Mechanic's
class. It's just the one time.
MEGHAN (V.O.)
Everyone misses that class at least
once.
Scene 20Page 13
DELLA
I guess some people find it boring.
MEGHAN (V.O.)
We'll see you the first week in
January then?
DELLA
Yes you will...unless I run off and
become an outlaw or something.
Meghan giggles. We hear the familiar beep of another call
coming in.
DELLA (CONT'D)
I have to go.
MEGHAN
Merry Christmas
DELLA
You too.
Della clicks the phone over to the incoming call.
DELLA (CONT'D)
Hello?
CASSIE (V.O.)
Hi Della... it's Cassie.
Cassie's voice is almost lost in the din of her surroundings.
DELLA
Where are you? Grand Central
Station?
CASSIE
Hold on, I'll take the phone
outside.
A loud noise appears out of nowhere.
21
21
The car SCREECHES to a halt. Della almost didn't see it. She
is at a railroad crossing, the third car in line, and she
almost rear-ended the car in front of her.
DELLA
FRICK!
Scene 21Page 14
CASSIE (V.O.)
Just a minute, Della.
DELLA
I almost rear-ended a car. Cassie?
The phone cuts out. The train starts to go laboriously past.
Carriage after carriage of brand name building materials for
new housing developments.
Della lights another cigarette.
She turns on the radio again, finds a station playing "The
Sound of Silence".
The crossing gates go up.
The cars ahead of her start.
Della shifts into drive.
The phone rings its special tune again.
Della turns the
volume of the radio down.
DELLA (CONT'D)
What's up, Cassie?
CASSIE (V.O.)
I'm over at Southeast Plaza. What
was it we need to get for Pilates?
DELLA
Huh? One of those rubber balls, I
think. I'm headed over there now.
Ran out of Christmas wrapping
paper. Would you believe it?
CASSIE (V.O.)
It's hell here tonight. Everyone
and their uncle is at the mall.
Della's phone makes a loud, distorted noise.
DELLA
Aw shoot. My cell battery's dying.
She rifles about in the passenger seat, leans over to the
back, and rifles about there among the kids toys, gives up.
DELLA (CONT'D)
Damn, I must have left the charger
in the other car.
Scene 21Page 15
CASSIE (V.O.)
You want me to pick up something
for you while I'm here?
Cassie's kind offer almost reduces Della to tears.
DELLA
No....I'm just. I mean I'm. Oh
nothing.
The phone beeps again.
CASSIE (V.O.)
Your phone's breaking up Della. I'm
not joking when I say it's packed
over here.
DELLA
It can't be that bad?
The light up ahead turns amber then red.
Della stops.
DELLA (CONT'D)
Why don't we meet somewhere for a
drink?
CASSIE (V.O.)
Sure, but a latte's about the best
they can do in this mall.
DELLA
A latte's fine. Let's meet at the
fountain opposite Victoria's
Secret.
The light changes and Della drives up and over a hill.
CASSIE (V.O.)
Sounds good.
The phone beeps again.
DELLA
My battery's going. I'm a block
away. See you in five minutes.
CASSIE (V.O.)
Okay but I won't be able to wait
very ....
The phone beeps again.
It's over.
Scene 21Page 16
Della lets it drop onto her lap. She opens the window and
flicks out the remains of her cigarette. She waves her hands
to fan away the smoke. She closes the window again.
She's about to hide her cigarettes again when she changes her
mind and stuffs them directly into her purse.
As the car approaches the cusp of the hill she slows down to
stare ahead.
22
22
For a second, Della contemplates turning around and leaving.
The guy in the SUV behind her beeps. She steps on the gas.
DELLA
Okay, okay!
Her car careens slowly down hill to the lot.
24
24
The road spits her out in front of the Mall entrance where
revellers and shoppers are entering and exiting.
Della follows several cars down the first long row of parked
cars.
The asphalt is wet from the recent rainfall. Puddles gather
in its dents and hollows.
She passes car after densely parked car. There isn't a space
in sight. She reaches the end of the row and indicates left,
turns down the next row, ploughs through a rain puddle which
splashes up onto a MOTHER who's walking her little GIRL and
BOY back to their car. The woman shouts at Della.
MOTHER
Watch where you're going!
Della rolls down her window.
Scene 24Page 17
DELLA
Sorry!
The Mother's weighed down with shopping bags. She glares at
Della and drags her kids across the aisle in front of her.
Della sighs, drives down the second aisle.
An Escape midway down the row blocks traffic. It's waiting
for a Subaru to pull out so it can take the spot.
25
25
DELLA
Lucky son of a .....
The Subaru exits the spot slowly. Della taps her impatient
fingers against the steering wheel.
26
26
It dawns on her that parking up close to the entrance just
isn't going to happen. She takes the last puff from the
cigarette burning out in the ashtray.
28
28
Della looks on for a moment at the confrontation. She grinds
out the stub of her cigarette into the ashtray, slams it
closed.
Scene 29Page 18
Della shakes her head and turns left into row five. Jesus!
Are there really this many cars in Pleasant Valley? It's a
brand new Mall and the only one around for miles but this is
ridiculous.
Della reaches the end of row five quickly. She guessed there
wouldn't be a spot so she's driving faster.
She notices a portly middle aged RENT-A-COP directing traffic
ahead. She lowers her window.
DELLA
Hello?
The Rent-a-Cop stops directing and approaches the car.
RENT-A-COP
Can I help you?
DELLA
Do you know where I can definitely
find parking?
RENT-A-COP
There's nothing close by. Even the
valet's backed up. You might want
to try further out.
He points off into the distance through the sea of cars.
RENT-A-COP (CONT'D)
But be willing to walk.
A car waiting behind Della honks its horn loudly and the Rent-
A-Cop saunters away. Della guns the Ford down row eight.
30
30
Cars... cars... If she never sees another car it will be too
soon.
Della spies a spot, halfway down the row.
DELLA
Yes!
Scene 31Page 19
She guns the engine, gets ready to pull in and is DENIED.
Somebody has parked an enormous old gold Plymouth so badly
it's taking up TWO spaces.
DELLA (CONT'D)
Unbelievable!
She brakes in the nick of time and sighs deeply. She's
starting to lose her patience now.
32
32
Della whips the car into the first one. She sighs with
relief as she straightens the car up into the spot. She sits
for a second trying to calm herself down but it isn't
working. She reaches for another cigarette, then, talks
herself out of it.
She fastens her coat, grabs her purse and opens the door.
34

MALL - EVENING
A wave of heat and Christmas lights hits Della. A wave of
nausea follows as she is swallowed by the crowd of last
minute shoppers. Distorted muzak versions of Christmas songs
seep from invisible speakers.
Della gets caught up in a line of children waiting to see
Santa in his grotto. She squeezes through and makes her way
towards the fountain outside of Victoria's Secret.
En route she is stopped by a perfume sales lady who sprays
her wrist with perfume before she has time to protest.
PERFUME SALES LADY
It's a classic revival of Chanel
No.5. We have a wonderful Christmas
Special on offer at Macy's.
She hands Della a sample and flyer.
Scene 36Page 21
DELLA
Thanks.
Della arrives at the fountain. A piddling jet of dirty water
gurgles from the mouth of a bored mermaid and streams down
into the shallow pool full of nickels and dimes. She scans
the crowd but there's no sign of Cassie.
Della sits at the edge of the fountain. She checks her watch
then checks out the people milling around in front of
Victoria's Secret, where mannequins in skimpy festive
underwear are propped seductively in the window displays.
Still no sign of Cassie. She's about to make a wish and throw
a quarter into the fountain when a Red Cross worker shakes
her "Save the Children" tin at her. Della sticks the quarter
into the tin instead.
37
37
VICTORIA'S SECRET - EVENING
Della wanders the aisles of festive colored undies watching
men pick out slinky lingerie for their partners and women
examine slim fit underpants and padded bras.
She notices a pure silk black teddy, very classic, no frills.
She lifts it from the rail and holds it against herself in
front of the mirror, tries to imagine herself in it.
A young SALES ASSISTANT approaches.
VS SALES ASSISTANT
It's pure silk, the last one in our
classic black label collection.
Would you like me to fix you a
changing room?
Della checks the size tag. It reads 36C, two sizes too big.
And the price tag next to it. Ouch! It's expensive for
Victoria's Secret.
DELLA
No thanks. Not my size.
She gestures to her small boobs, smiles and hands the teddy
to the sales assistant. She quickly leaves the shop.
38
38
Della checks one last time at the fountain for Cassie. She
tries to dodge the crowd as she makes her way toward a
generic coffee shop. Maybe Cassie will be there.
Scene 39Page 22
39
39
Harried women and a few men, clutching bags full of gifts and
impatient children, stand on line for their favorite drug.
Della squeezes past them to look for Cassie. Every seat at
every booth is full but there's no sign of her friend.
Della joins the line. She finds herself biting at her nails,
a bad habit since childhood.
A woman in front of her places an order then moves on to the
pick up area. Della moves up to the counter to where an
OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT waits on her.
DELLA
A latte please?
She notices some chocolate covered biscotti on the counter.
DELLA (CONT'D)
And a chocolate biscotti.
She catches sight of herself in the mirror behind the
counter. Kenneth's right about one thing, she looks awful.
OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT
Bitter or Milk chocolate?
Seeing herself in the mirror changes her mind about the
biscotti.
DELLA
Forget it, just the coffee.
OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT
Name?
DELLA
Della, two L's.
OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT
Four dollars and seventy nine
cents.
Della pushes the money towards her and waits for her coffee.
When it finally shows up her name is spelled DELA. She sighs
and checks the line for Cassie as she leaves the shop.
Scene 40Page 23
40
40
She passes a hair salon and presses her face to the steamy
windows. Inside, women are getting their hair styled and
their nails manicured at the same time.
Della looks down at her bitten nails but just can't bring
herself to go inside.
LYNN (O.S.)
Della, is that you?
She turns around to see LYNN MONROE, a pretty, well groomed
redhead about her age.
DELLA
Lynn Monroe!
LYNN
I knew it was you, Della. I haven't
seen you since college. You left to
marry some handsome jock and we
never heard from you again.
DELLA
Something like that. Do you live
around here now?
LYNN
David and I just bought this divine
house in Pleasant Valley. Do you
know it? Great for the kids.
Della nods but Lynn keeps speaking. Della sips on her latte.
LYNN (CONT'D)
It's the first time I've left the
doors unlocked since I was a child
growing up in the Midwest. David's
been promoted to VP of United
Motors so it's all happening for
us. But enough of me. How are you?
DELLA
Oh, we have two kids. Twins, Tammi
and Terri.
Lynn becomes distracted, focusing on her perfect reflection
in the steamy glass.
Scene 40Page 24
LYNN
Why that's fantastic. Listen Della,
it's been great talking to you but
I have to go get my hair done!
David and I are going out tomorrow
night for a romantic dinner. I just
bought this gorgeous teddy from
Victoria's Secret.
She opens the bag and Della sees it's the black teddy she
eyed earlier. Della smiles.
LYNN (CONT'D)
Hope we bump into each other again
soon, sweetie. Merry Christmas
She gives Della a fake kiss and rushes into the salon.
Della chucks her half finished coffee into a nearby trash can
and walks on through the Mall.

PHARMACY - EVENING
Della enters a pharmacy. She locates the wrapping paper
aisle. She sweeps up a bunch of rolls at three for ninety
nine cents. She feels the texture of the paper, it's thin and
looks gaudy so she puts them all back. Instead she selects
some expensive gold paper with silver embossed stars and
matching silver ribbon. She then finds some jolly children's
wrapping with Christmas tree designs and a great big red bow.
She browses through the aisles of cards. She sees some cute
cards for the twins and then arrives at the "To my Darling
Husband at Christmas" section. She opens some of the cards
and recoils from the sentiments contained inside.
She catches a groomed BLONDE HOUSEWIFE staring at her and
corrects her facial expression from one of revulsion to a
complicit Stepford smile.
DELLA
It's a pity they don't have any "To
a bastard at Christmas" cards.
The woman looks at Della like she's a lunatic. Della chuckles
to herself.
She finds the feminine hygiene aisle and picks up a pack of
regular tampax.
She gathers her stuff and carries it to the checkout where a
TIRED MAN and his TWO KIDS wait before her on the line.
Scene 41Page 25
The man tries to remove a snow globe, with a tiny house and
Christmas tree inside, from the clutches of his young son.
The child starts bawling. The man ends up buying the snow
globe to placate the child.
It's Della's turn.
The PHARMACY SALES ASSISTANT smiles.
PH SALES ASSISTANT
Perfect timing!
DELLA
God planned it for Christmas Day
just to tick me off.
PH SALES ASSISTANT
Thirty dollars and sixty nine cents
She packs Della's stuff into paper bags. Della hands her visa
card over.
DELLA
Thanks.
PH SALES ASSISTANT
Merry Christmas.
42
42
It's a lot less crowded now. The melancholy "Home for
Christmas" plays. She follows the ladies sign to the entrance
to the bathroom, only to find an "Out of Order" sign on the
door. She sees a cleaning lady in the corridor.
DELLA
How come the ladies' bathroom is
out of order on a night like this?
CLEANING LADY
The one at the other side of the
mall is open, Ma'am.
The
cleaning lady disappears through the bathroom door with
her
cart of cleaning utensils. Della looks down the length of
the
huge mall and decides she's not even going to try to find
the
other bathroom. She can wait until she gets home.
She makes her way towards the exit, pulls her coat in tight
and braces herself for the cold front outside.

FORD EXPLORER
- EVENING
Della turns the key in the ignition and presses in the
lighter. She lights a cigarette and inhales as she lets the
car warm up for 30 seconds.
She rests the cigarette in the ashtray while she releases the
hand brake and slips the gear into reverse. The interior of
her car is suddenly flooded with light from another car's
headlights. She glances in the rear view mirror. A car is
blocking her.
DELLA
Good Lord! What now?
She steps on the brake and waits for the car to move.
But it doesn't. Its headlights flick to full beam blinding
her view in her car mirrors. She honks her horn. The car
still doesn't move.
Della's really angry now. She slips the gearshift into park
and steps out of her car.

FORD EXPLORER
- EVENING
Della flinches but no
bullet tears through the back of her
skull. She slams into
the driver's seat and punches the door
lock switch. She hits
the four wheel drive button and presses
the accelerator pedal
to the metal.
The Explorer barely protests as its front tires claw and
bounce over the six inch concrete row barrier. The barrier
screeches along the underside of the frame. There is a loud
SCRAAAAAPE noise as the car heaves over the barrier. Then,
the rear wheels bounce and claw over. The car fishtails
momentarily.
DELLA
Please God. Don't overcorrect.
She releases the pressure on the accelerator. The Explorer
straightens.
47
47
She shakes the cell phone trying to revive its dead battery.
Types 911 in anyway. No connection. No response. She shakes
it some more. Gives up.
She relentlessly checks the rearview and side mirrors as she
races into the rainy night.
The driving conditions are not good, poor visibility ahead.
Too bad. She speeds anyway.
The road has to connect to a main road soon!
Another glance in the rearview. Nothing. Side mirror. Still
clear. Once more in the rearview. Headlights!
DELLA
No!
Side mirror. It's the Plymouth.
She presses the accelerator down harder. The engine revs.
In the rearview there's a sudden flash above her rear left
headlight. And another.
DELLA (CONT'D)
Jesus!
They're shooting at her!
Della steps the accelerator to the floor praying the Explorer
won't skid out. The engine struggles, catches up.
The sudden speed causes a small silver love heart, hanging on
a silver chain necklace from the rearview mirror, to crash
against the window. The catch bursts open to reveal two tiny
photos of the twins inside. The necklace flies back and forth
against the window as the Explorer races onwards.
50
50
Another flash and Della's left side mirror shatters.
She swerves in panic. Her car almost hits the ditch.
This can't be happening. Not to her.
She reclaims the steering wheel.
Straightens up. Hits the
accelerator again.
52
52
Right or left, Della? Make a choice.
54
54
Close to screaming now she speeds up.
59
59
Hope. She pulls in and dims her lights, drives right up to
the kiosk door.
Hope dashed.
62
62
Her wipers struggle to cope. She can hardly see through the
front window.
65
65
She steers the Ford blindly.
Scene 67Page 38
67
67
She guns the engine and ducks sideways as her car PLOWS into
the barrier.
There's a sickening crack as shattered windshield sprays
around her.
69
69
Della tries to sit upright but the auto's spinning too fast.
71
71
The Car stalls out. SILENCE. A prolonged moment.
Then Della crawls out from under the dashboard, sweeping pine
needles and glass from her hair. She reaches up and hits the
light switch.
Pine branches protrude through the broken windshield.
Using the sleeve of her coat she sweeps broken glass from the
driver's seat and sits down.
She slides the gear into park, turns the key. The engine
groans like a dying animal, then gives up.
She takes a deep breath.
She tries again. The engine groans again, another death
rattle. It just won't catch.
She switches off the interior light and pushes the driver
door open. She steps out of the car.
Scene 73Page 39

FORD EXPLORER
- EVENING
Della turns the key. It barely even groans this time. Just a
faint gurgle. Then gone.
She rifles in the glove compartment and pulls out the flare,
sticks it in her pocket.
She leans under the dash and manually pops the trunk.
75
75
Della dives into an unfinished house, hides behind a space
where a window will eventually be, looks out across the
building site. All is dark outside. And then she sees the
light several rows down, weaving between the houses.
She makes for another window at the opposite end of the
house. She sees the mall lights and decides to head once more
towards them.
88
88
They're searching the house next door.
TOMAS
Where'd little red riding hood git
to?
VINH
She ain't leaving any bread crumbs
that's for sure.
HUEY
When a nigga hungry, Imma wolf.
94
94
She crawls into the foundations of a nearby house, underneath
the floorboards which are lain roughly across to form a first
floor. She huddles in a dark corner. It's very quiet and
cramped. She tries not to move, not to breathe. The smell of
the wet earth underneath makes her feel nauseous. A moment
passes. It feels like an infinity.
Scene 95Page 49
She starts to creep along towards a gap in the planks to see
if she can see anything above. Just as she approaches the gap
she hears.
The sound of footsteps above her.
She freezes.
The footsteps make erratic rhythms across the planks.
She silently undoes the catch of the toolbox. Her hands are
shaking. She lifts the lid. She rakes around inside for
tools, comes across several kids toys instead! In shock, she
rakes around some more, trying to find something else,
something more dangerous, anything. To her surprise the only
tools inside are a pathetic little screwdriver and a small
crescent wrench. The kids must have borrowed the other tools
replacing them with the toys. She gives up, closes over the
lid.
Then suddenly:
BOOM
96
96
The whole house is illuminated. She looks up to see four
faces looking down at her. Chuckie points the gaze of a
powerful flashlight directly into her eyes.
The beam almost blinds her. She tries to look away but
Chuckie focuses it right in her eyes.
CHUCKIE
Peek a boo!
She shrinks back towards the wall. Her mouth feels dry, so
dry. Tomas lifts several planks up and casts them away so
they can see her. She's cornered.
Chuckie then lowers the flashlights direction and sweeps it
voyeuristically down across her body.
The light lingers on her breasts. Huey whistles
appreciatively, picks the game back up from the parking lot.
HUEY
Yo left without yo goodbye kiss.
The light sweeps past Huey's hips. The sound of a zipper. The
light sweeps back up onto Della.
Scene 96Page 50
CHUCKIE
You a window shopper little
brother. You ain't never even done
the old in and out before.
Waves of pain spasm through Della's shoulder.
The boys snigger.
HUEY
Imma just a young playa tryin' to
put my bid in.
Tomas leans down towards Della. Chuckie moves the flashlight
to illuminate them both. Tomas drains the last dregs from a
bottle of Bud, tosses the empty bottle down into the
foundations. It rolls into the darkness.
Della shudders. She clutches the lug wrench against her coat
behind the tool box and tries to disappear into the wall.
TOMAS
Don't worry, when we done wit you
we send yo back in yo trunk to Mr.
Podunk.
Tomas reaches down and pulls Della up to standing by the coat
collar. He then yanks the coat down over her shoulder. The
white shirt she wears underneath is damp with sweat making
the form of her breasts very clear.
Chuckie keeps the light focused right on her.
Tomas slides his index finger down across Della's neck
towards her breasts.
Della claws at Tomas' face with the nails of her free hand.
He staggers to the side holding his cheek and cursing. Her
chewed nails haven't left any dents, but she stunned him.
The others laugh.
She shrugs the coat back over her shoulders and pulls it
tight across herself, once again clasping the toolbox close
to her side.
TOMAS (CONT'D)
Don't want to play nice? Puta!
He moves towards her, face twisted with hate, arm raised.
Scene 96Page 51
CHUCKIE
Back off five minutes, my Ghetto
brother.
Tomas glares at Della, then lowers his arm. Spits on the
ground instead. Turns back to the boys. Chuckie moves
forwards and focuses on Della's box?
CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
What's with the man size crast?
Della doesn't answer.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
You running with the family jewels?
Della still doesn't answer.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
You rob a bank this morning, Della?
Della remains determinedly mute.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
Least yo learned something tonight
Della honey?
VINH
Yeah, like how to quit mouthing if
you wanna avoid drama.
CHUCKIE
You must be wondering how we come
to know your name.
Chuckie giggles. Della shivers.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
You screwed up Della Myers. Left
your purse in the Ford.
Chuckie holds up her driving licence and examines it.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
What a shitty photo!
Chuckie nods to Vinh. Vinh passes his lighter to Chuckie.
Chuckie lights the licence on fire. The plastic burns black
and toxic. The flame annihilates Della's name, her date of
birth, her face. Pieces of plastic unfurl and drift up
through the empty windows and doors of the unfinished house.
Scene 96Page 52
CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
Guess you won't be needing it no
more.
Della stares defiantly, fighting back the internal nausea
caused by this symbolically brutal act.
Chuckie maneuvers the light back in her eyes then right back
on his own menacing face. Then, back again on her face. She
becomes disoriented.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
So what's in the box?
Della remains mute, looks away from the beam.
HUEY
Yo think she carrying the big
notes, maybe some ice?
CHUCKIE
Nah, it ain't about to rain
diamonds, Huey. But maybe she
cashed in her life savings. Planned
to take off, start a new life.
Della tries to swallow but her throat is too dry.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
That right Della?
TOMAS
You got enough scratch in there to
grease us up with?
She knows there is nothing that would buy them off and the
knowledge sinks like a stone deep into her gut.
Chuckie follows her face with the beam. She tries to dodge
its glare in her eyes. But he maneuvers it like a
surveillance camera.
His voice takes on a meanness that makes the back of her neck
tingle.
CHUCKIE
Open it.
They crowd closer toward her.
Dark forms with eyes glinting. Their voices echoing.
Scene 96Page 53
VINH
Open the box else we put you in
trauma.
CHUCKIE
OPEN IT!
Della all but screams.
DELLA
Okay!
I'll open it.
Della's brain races.
Her hands move slowly.
She rests the lug wrench in her left palm under the base of
the tool box and with her right hand unsnaps the catch.
She holds the far end of the lid up to shield her right hand
from the beam as she slips it inside the box.
A prayer plays silently across her lips as her fingers feel
the cool steel and shape of the small crescent wrench.
She curls them around its handle and grips tight. A surge of
nervous energy courses through her veins.
TOMAS
She ain't got nuthin'. Let's just
take that pussy and git going.
He moves towards her.
In a flash, she withdraws the crescent wrench. She cocks her
wrist back and hurls the tool, snaps it just like her daddy
taught her to play baseball.
The wrench flies up and across the house.
With a CRUNCH, it catches Chuckie right in the collar bone,
right side.
He screams. Drops the flashlight. Drops to his knees holding
his throat.
Della snaps the tool box shut and makes a run for it. She
throws herself up onto the first floor and darts between
Tomas and Huey.
Scene 96Page 54
Huey lunges for her but trips over a loose plank, lands with
his face down, biting on the plank's edge.
Della catches a peripheral glimpse of Tomas leaping towards
her, but his leading foot slams down instead onto the back of
Huey's neck. Grinds Huey's face into the plank with a hideous
THUD. Huey's neck SNAPS back smiley style. Huey's scream
gurgles into the night. Huey's body falls through the space
in the floorboards landing with a thud in the foundations
below.
Tomas falls away, cursing in horror.
TOMAS (CONT'D)
Maricon!
Della makes a run for the doorway. She jumps down onto the
muddy lot and heads off across the development. The darkness
quickly swallows her.
Behind her, Vinh slumps through the house.
VINH
What the fuck, niggaz?
CHUCKIE
Shut up.
VINH
You hurt?
CHUCKIE
SHUT THE FUCK UP.
Chuckie slides down to be beside Huey in the foundations.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
And don't be using the N word. You
ain't representing. GOT IT. That
right Huey? HUEY. Get up Huey. HUEY
GET UP!
Tomas staggers up to standing.
TOMAS
Jesus hijo de maria el virgene.
VINH
What?
Vinh moves towards Chuckie who is crouched over Huey.
Scene 96Page 55
CHUCKIE
My little brother.
Tomas approaches.
He pushes Chuckie gently out of the way so he can see.
He stares down at Huey's bloody meshed face. Tomas staggers
backwards and crosses himself.
TOMAS
Mamacita! Madre de Dios!
Chuckie punches Tomas' leg.
CHUCKIE
You tread on my boy's face. YOU
KILLED HIM.
TOMAS
I didn't kill him. I didn't kill no
one.
Tomas pushes Chuckie backwards.
TOMAS (CONT'D)
She did it. She killed him.
Chuckie and Tomas stare at each other.
TOMAS (CONT'D)
I'm gonna cross that bitch out.
97
97
She climbs into the driver's seat and turns the key. No
connection. No surprises there!
115
115
She quickly climbs back into the car and turns the keys. The
engine sputters but doesn't fully catch. She turns the keys
again - another wimpy sputter. Again, this time the sputter
gathers momentum, catches for a second, gives up. She tries
again, the sputter gathers momentum and catches for real.
Della looks over her shoulder and backs up, pulls out of the
tree, up and past the broken barrier and onto the road. She
makes a tight U-Turn, sticks the car into four wheel drive
and plows down the rough gravely road.
117
117
She passes that stop sign, sighs. The barrier is open and the
road up to the mall stretches freely ahead. She slowly inches
out on to the road and commits to her return to
"civilization".
120
120
She punches the accelerator, drives just over the speed
limit.
122
122
She hears the siren before she sees the police car.
God, she hopes they don't notice her smashed up windscreen,
the fucked up side of the Ford.
124
124
Of course.
How long has it been? That poor security guard.
She checks the car clock. It's only 85 minutes since she left
the house! Hard to believe. Feels like another lifetime.
Another cop car whizzes past the line. How long before they
come for her? She's got to get back to the kids.
Della adjusts the rearview mirror. Her gaunt bloody face
looks back.
DELLA
Oh my.
She looks at her hands, they're ingrained with mud and blood.
And her clothes!
While waiting for the traffic to start moving again she
fumbles on the passenger seat, finds some kleenex.
She wipes her hands, her face, using the rearview mirror,
some Kleenex and the rest of the water. She looks only
slightly better.
The line starts moving. Della follows. She passes the police
cars, steals a cursory glance.
She keeps checking her face in the mirror. The cars soon
start to disperse in different directions. The Mall
disappears behind her. She turns left onto an almost empty
road.
She can't wait to see her babies, make sure they're okay. How
could anyone expect her to go the speed limit at a time like
this.
Scene 125Page 93
She hits forty, forty-five, fifty. Takes it all the way up to
sixty. Runs a light.
126
126
At sixty-five she races across the railway track. She slows
down to just above speed limit when she sees a car ahead on
the adjoining road.
With one hand guiding the wheel she grabs the lipstick from
her purse.
She carefully applies it in the rearview but her mouth is so
parched it just cakes into her chapped lips. She wipes it
away.
128
128
She applies some lipstick to her cheeks to give her some
color. But she just looks odd. She ends up wiping it away
with the back of her hand.
Gosh, this car in front is really taking its sweet time. She
decides to overtake. She accelerates to sixty. As she passes
the driver stares at her car.
She slows down so as not to arouse any more suspicion. She
passes the familiar sign for "Pleasant Valley Drive". The
road's empty ahead so she guns it to sixty-five.
The closer she gets to home, the faster she wants to go. She
tries to resist but can't. The speedometer hits seventy.
The car hurtles into the night. Oh No, a red light ahead. And
a car waiting to go in the opposite direction. She decides to
slow for this one. Barely makes it - screeches to a halt. The
driver in the forward facing car checks her out. She attempts
to smile and look like a normal housewife.

DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING
KENNETH
Where the hell have you been?
Scene 132Page 95
Kenneth's voice meets her as she steps into the house. Nice
welcome.
She doesn't respond. Closes the door behind her. Walks into
the house.
There he is ahead, leaning against the office door. Beer in
one hand, remote in the other. The TV blaring behind him.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
I said....
He's about to begin shouting again when he notices
something's not right about her.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Della?
He switches the TV volume down using the remote.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Della honey are you all right?
She stares back at him coldly.
DELLA
Please don't call me that. Don't
ever call me that again.
KENNETH
What?
She steps slowly towards him. Sees a violent adventure flick
wrapping up behind him on TV. The end credits scroll down the
screen.
DELLA
I just wanted to get home to my
babies.
Kenneth cannot understand her garbled words. He sees the
dried blood on her chin, matted mud on her coat.
KENNETH
What happened to you?
She just stares.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Was there an accident?
Scene 132Page 96
She keeps staring, looks at him with a cold odd expression.
She needs to be held like a child but he doesn't even move
towards her. Just stands there like a jerk, unsure of what
to do, so he takes a swig of beer.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Are you hurt?
That swig of beer turns what was left of her love for him to
stone.
A beat.
DELLA
Are they okay?
Without waiting for an answer.
133
133
She turns and races up the stairs.
134
134
She opens the door softly. The night light casts a pale glow
out low across the carpet. There they are, all tucked up in
their quilts, breathing gently, little faces flushed with
sleep.
She sighs, closes her eyes with relief, softly closes the
door behind her.
135
135
Walks back downstairs.
136
136
Kenneth is pacing about the kitchen, opening another beer.
KENNETH
Sound asleep, huh?
Kenneth, unsure what to do, tries to make a joke.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
So. What'd you bring me from the
mall?
Della sighs, calmly pulls out the gun from her pocket, looks
him right in the eye, points the barrel at his face.
Scene 136Page 97
He shrinks back, silent for once, blind panic playing across
his face.
But not hers. She's cold, cold as the icy night.
She pulls the trigger at point blank range. CLICK
He recoils.
But no bullet disengages from the barrel. Nothing. She knew
there were no bullets left.
But the click echoes throughout the silent house.
DELLA
Nothing.
