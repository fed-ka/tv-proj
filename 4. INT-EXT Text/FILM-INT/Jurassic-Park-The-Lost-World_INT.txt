Mrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the
YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER
EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
monied corporation.
All are in expensive suits, most are over
sixty.
There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their
lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their
ears.
Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
hint that everyone's been here a long time.
A familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.
VOICE (O.S.)
The hurricane seemed like a disaster
at the time, but now I think it was a
blessing, nature's way of freeing
those animals from their human
confines.
Of giving them another
chance to survive, but this time as
they were meant to, without man's
interference.
The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen
and creator of Jurassic Park.
But he's not in the room.
His
image is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled
up to the end of the table.
And he doesn't look good.
He's terribly infirmed, propped up
in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING
around him.
HAMMOND (cont'd)
There are some corporate issues that
are not about the bottom line.
We
have so much still to learn about
those creatures.
A whole world of
intricate, interlocking behaviors,
vanished everywhere -- except for
Site B. Please.
Let's not do what
is good for more men at the expense
at what is best for all mankind.
The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.
CHAIRMAN
Thank you, John.
Mr. Ludlow?
He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the
anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.
Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white
eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.
LUDLOW
(an accent similar to
Hammond's)
These pictures were taken in a
hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight
hours ago, after an American family
on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site
B.
The little girl will be fine, but
her parents are wealthy, angry, and
very fond of lawsuits.
But that's
hardly new to us, is it?
(takes a paper from the
file)
Wrongful death settlements, partial
list:
family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5
million dollars; family of Robert
Muldoon, 12.6 million.
Damaged or
destroyed equipment, 17.3 million.
Demolition, de-construction, and
disposal of Isla Nublar facilities,
organic and inorganic, one hundred
and twenty-six million dollars.
The
list goes on, gentlemen -- research
funding, media payoffs.
Silence is
expensive.
He's warming up.
Not a bad performer.
LUDLOW (cont'd)
This corporation has been bleeding
from the throat for four years.
You,
our board of directors, have set
patiently and listened to ecology
lectures while Mr. Hammond signed
your checks and spent your money.
You have watched your stock drop from
seventy-eight and a quarter to
nineteen flat with no good and in
sight.
And all along, we have held a
significant product asset that we
could have safely harvested and
displayed for profit.
Enormous
profit.
He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,
sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
them.
It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.
Cages hold tiny
replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
and Tourists look on in wonder.
LUDLOW (cont'd)
Enough money to wipe out four years
of lawsuits and damage control and
unpleasant infighting, enough to not
only send our stock back to where it
was but to double it.
And the one
thing, the only thing standing
between us and this asset is a
born-again naturalist who happens to
be our own CEO.
Well, I don't work
for Mother Nature.
I work for you.
Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.
Ludlow takes one and reads from it.
LUDLOW (cont'd)
"Whereas the Chief Executive
Officer has engaged in wasteful and
negligent business practices to
further his own personal
environmental beliefs --
Whereas these practices have
affected the financial performance
of the company by incurring
significant losses --
Whereas the shareholders have been
materially harmed by these losses --
Thereby, be it resolved that John
Parker Hammond should be resolved from
the office of Chief Executive
Officer, affective immediately."
Mr.
Chairman, I move the resolution be
put to an immediate vote.
Do I have
a second?
BOARD MEMBER
I second the motion,
Mr. Chairman,
Please poll the members by a show of
hands.
The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.
He can't
bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.
CHAIRMAN
All those in favor of InGen Corporate
Resolution 213C, please signify your
approval by raising your right hand.
It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes
up.
Ludlow sits back, victorious.
Hammond, furious, raises
his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at
the TV screen.
It goes blank.
CUT TO:
Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
underneath Manhattan.
The door WHOOSH open, spit out some
COMMUTERS and suck up a few more.
A tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving
as fast as he can.
The subway doors begin to close, but just
before they meet --
-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.
The man
is IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.
There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been
there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he
doesn't care.
MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.
He looks awful.
Tired.
Weathered.
He notices a CURIOUS MAN
across from his is staring at his.
Malcolm looks away.
The
Curious Man still stares.
Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and
approaches.
MALCOLM
(under his breath)
Shit.
The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.
MAN
You're him, aren't you?
MALCOLM
Excuse me?
MAN
The guy.
The scientist.
I saw you
on TV.
(conspiratorially)
I believed you.
No response from Malcolm.
The guy leans in even closer.
MAN (cont'd)
Roooooarr.
MALCOLM
(a withering look)
I was misquoted.
I was merely
speculating on the evolutionary
scenario of a Lost World.
I never
said I was in any such place.
He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the
Curious Man.
As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS
across from him are staring at him.
He looks at them.
They looks away.
He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.
Nowhere
to hide.
A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:
BUTLER
Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
calling?
MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
Avenue apartment.
MALCOLM
Ian Malcolm
A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back.
It bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.
It
lunges --
-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.
The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.
The
Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.
BUTLER
Not an animal lover?
MALCOLM
Not really.
MALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.
JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;
Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells
us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.
HAMMOND
Ian!
Don't linger in the doorway
like an ingenue, come in, come in!
Malcolm steps further into the room.
HAMMOND (cont'd)
It's good to see you.
It really is.
How's the leg?
MALCOLM
Resentful.
HAMMOND
When you have a lot of time to think,
it's funny who you remember.
It's
the people who challenged you.
It is
the quality of our opponents that
gives our accomplishments meaning.
I
never told you how sorry I was about
what happened after we returned.
Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it
hard to sustain anger.
MALCOLM
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
HAMMOND
It's the lawyers.
The lawyers are
finally killing me.
MALCOLM
They do have motives.
Why did you
want to see me?
Your message said it
was urgent.
HAMMOND
You were right -- and I was wrong.
There!
Did you ever think you'd hear
me say that?
Spectacularly wrong.
Instead of observing those animals, I
tried to control them.
I squandered
an opportunity and we still know next
to nothing about their lives.
Not
their lives as man would have them,
behind electric fences, but in the
wild.
Behavior in their natural
habitat, the impossible dream of any
paleontologist.
I could have had it,
but I let it slip away.
(pause)
Thank God for Site B.
Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.
MALCOLM
What?
HAMMOND
(a spark in his eye)
Well?
Didn't it all seem a trifle
compact to you?
MALCOLM
What are you talking about?
HAMMOND
The hatchery, in particular?
You
know my initial yields had to be low,
far less than one percent, that's a
thousand embryos for every single
live birth.
Genetic engineering on
that scale implies a giant operation,
not the spotless little laboratory I
showed you.
MALCOLM
I don't believe you.
HAMMOND
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
something for the tourists, Site B
was the factory floor.
We built it
first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some
miles from Nublar.
MALCOLM
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
HAMMOND
After the accident at the park, a
hurricane wiped out our facility on
Site B.
We had to evacuate and leave
the animals to fend for themselves.
And they did.
For four years I've
fought to keep them safe from human
meddling, now I want you to go there
and document them.
MALCOLM
Are you out of your mind?
I still
have nightmares, my reputation's a
joke, my leg is shot -- you think I
need more of that?
HAMMOND
It would be the most extraordinary
living fossil record the world has
ever seen.
MALCOLM
So what?
Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
to him and open it on his lap.
Inside, there are memos,
charts, maps and photographs.
HAMMOND
I've been putting this together for
over a year.
(MORE)
I have personal suggestions for your
entire team, phone numbers, contact
people.
They won't believe you about
what they're going to see, so don't
bother trying to convince them.
Just
use my checkbook to get them there.
I'll fund your expedition through my
personal accounts, as such money and
equipment as you need, but only if
you leave immediately.
If we
hesitate, all will be lost.
MALCOLM
John . . .
HAMMOND
You'll need an animal behaviorist,
someone with unimpeachable
credentials.
I believe you already
know Sarah Harding.
She's got
theories about parenting and
nurturing among hunter/scavengers I
bet she'd be dying to prove on a
scale like this.
If you convince her
to go, it'll be a major coup.
When
she publishes, the scientific
community must take it seriously.
Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.
HAMMOND
Your documentation, you should use
forensic photographic methods,
Hasselbladt still cameras, high
definition video.
When the trick
photography analysts take your
evidence apart, make it impossible
for them to say there was enhancement
or computer graphic imaging.
Oh,
this is very important -- avoid the
island interior at all costs.
Stick
to the outer rim.
Everything you
need to know can be found there.
Vindication lies on the outer rim.
Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.
MALCOLM
I'm not going, John.
HAMMOND
(fatigue returning)
Ian, you are my last chance to give
something of real value to the world.
I can't walk so far and leave no
footprints; die and leave nothing
with my name on it.
I will not
be
known only for my failures.
And you
will not allow yourself to go down in
history as a lunatic.
You're too
smart.
You'e too proud.
Dr.
Malcolm.
Please.
This is a chance
at redemption.
For both of us.
There's no time to equivocate, we
must seize it now, before --
He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.
Malcom turns.
PETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the
doorway to the bedroom.
He looks back and forth from Hammond
to Malcolm suspiciously.
LUDLOW
Hello, Uncle John.
Dr. Malcolm.
Malcolm doesn't answer.
He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes
him.
LUDLOW (cont'd)
Did I interrupt something?
Malcolm turns back to Hammond.
MALCOLM
Find someone else.
CUT TO:
In the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle
rudely, and shepherds him to the door.
LUDLOW
So, you two were just, uh, telling
old campfire stories, were you?
MALCOLM
Do me a favor.
Don't pretend for a
second that you and I don't know the
truth.
You can convince Time
magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
of whatever you want, but I was
there.
LUDLOW
You signed a non-disclosure agreement
before you went to the island that
expressly forbade you from discussing
anything you saw.
You violated that
agreement.
MALCOLM
You cost me my livelihood.
That on
which I relied to support my
children.
LUDLOW
If your university felt you were
causing it embarrassment by selling
wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly
see how I am to--
MALCOLM
I didn't tell anything, I told the
truth.
LUDLOW
You version of it.
MALCOLM
There are no versions of the truth!
This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's
my life.
LUDLOW
We made a generous compensatory offer
for your injuries.
MALCOLM
It was a payoff and an insult.
InGen
never--
LUDLOW
InGen is my livelihood, Dr.
Malcolm, and I will jealously defend
its interests.
People will know what
I want them to know when I want them
to know it.
Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.
It sails across the
foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with
one hand.
It's his cane.
LUDLOW (cont'd)
Don't forget that.
Malcolm stares at him for a long moment.
Finally, he turns
and walks away.
But he does not out of the apartment.
Instead, he
walks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps
back into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with
a determined CLICK.
HAMMOND looks up, hopeful, as MALCOLM comes back into the room
and walks over to his bed.
He reaches down --
-- and picks up the file folder.
MALCOLM
Do you have a satellite phone?
CUT TO:
ROLAND TEMBO, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond
hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an
African cafe/bar in Mombassa.
It's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals,
but there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too, Americans on
safari who somehow found the local handout.
They're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly
eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book,
eyeglasses hanging low on his nose.
Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.
He looks
up.
He SNIFFS the air once, then smiles and calls out a
person's name.
ROLAND
Ajay?
He turns around.
AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU, a wiry East Indian in
his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to
sneak up.
AJAY
(delighted)
How did you know?
ROLAND
(taps his nose)
That cheap aftershave I send you
every Christmas, you actually wear
it.
I'm touched.
Sit down, sit
down, what brings you to Mombassa?
AJAY
You.
Tell me, Roland, when was the
last time you answered your phone?
ROLAND
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.
Why?
Behind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly.
One of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.
AJAY
I got a call from a gentleman who's
going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.
If he's to be believed, it's a most,
uh, unique expedition.
And very
well-funded.
ROLAND
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son
of a bitch.
You go.
The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress.
His
buddies LAUGHS.
Roland throws a glance, annoyed.
AJAY
But alone?
We always had great
success together, you and I.
ROLAND
Just a little bit too much, I
think.
AJAY
How do you mean?
ROLAND
A true hunter doesn't mind if the
animal wins.
If it escapes.
But
there weren't enough escapes from you
and me, Ajay.
I've decided to spend
a bit less time in the company of
death.
Maybe I just feel too close
to it my--
The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Most
Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass.
Roland is out of his
chair in a second.
ROLAND (cont'd)
(to Ajay)
Excuse me.
Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something to
the Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind
him.
He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist.
ROLAND (cont'd)
You, sir -- are no gentleman.
TOURIST
Is that supposed to be an insult?
ROLAND
I can think of none greater.
The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs.
TOURIST
Buzz off, you silly old bastard.
ROLAND
What do I have to do to pick a fight
with you, bring your mother into it?
TOURIST
Are you kidding?
I could take you
with one arm tied down.
ROLAND
Really?
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR,
the Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the
back of his pants with a napkin.
He pulls the knot tight and
the man turns around.
It's Roland, with his arm tied down.
The Tourist stands
across from him.
TOURIST
I mean my arm.
POW!
Roland punches him square in the jaw.
The Tourist
reels, stunned.
Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging with
both arms.
Roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist
to turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face.
The Tourist
spins and goes down to the floor, face first.
A cloud of
sawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar.
BACK AT HIS TABLE,
Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
Ajay.
In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedly
carry their fallen cohort out of the bar.
ROLAND
Sorry.
We were saying?
AJAY
You broke that idiot's jaw for no
reason other than your boredom.
Tell
the truth, Roland.
Aren't you even
interested in knowing this
expedition's quarry?
ROLAND
Ajay.
Go on up to my ranch, take a
look around the trophy room, and tell
me what kind of quarry you think
could possibly be of any interest
to me.
Ajay just smiles.
CUT TO:
Ian Malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the
end of a bench.
Two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and
MALCOLM is lifting them, painfully rehabbing his injury while
talking on a satellite phone.
MALCOLM
We leave in twenty-four hours.
Five
member team.
Behind them, the SPARKS of a acetylene torch fly as WORKMEN
make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark-green
Mercedes Benz AAV (all-activity vehicle).
The hood of the AAV
is up and the V-6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller
engine is lowered in its place.
To one side are two long
trailers, connected by an accordion-like passageway, like on a
subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other.
MALCOLM
Eddie Carr's handling all our
equipment and he'll be there to
maintain it.
He's designing special
field trailers now, top of the line
mobile research units.
EDDIE CARR, fortyish, is barking out orders to the Workmen.
EDDIE
No, no, look at the plans, Henry,
you can't place that strut laterally,
it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE
PLANS!
From the ceiling, a large metal age CRASHES down, landing
next to them on the floor with a deafening CLANG.
They leap
back and look up.
A WORKMAN waves from a scaffolding.
WORKMAN
Sorry, Eddie!
Specs say it can't
deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test
it
Eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular,
constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars.
Malcolm hangs
up the phone and walks up, joining him.
MALCOLM
Any damage?
EDDIE
Minimal.
MALCOLM
"Minimal" is too much.
It has to be
light, it has to be strong --
EDDIE
Light and strong, light and strong,
sure, why not, it's only impossible.
God save me from academics.
MALCOLM
You are an academic.
EDDIE
Former academic.
Now I actually make
things.
I don't just talk.
MALCOLM
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
EDDIE
(doesn't look at him)
It doesn't matter what I think.
MALCOLM
Is there anything we've forgotten?
Anything at all?
Behind them, someone CLEARS THEIR THROAT.
Eddie and Malcolm
turn around.
KELLY MALCOLM, an African-American girl around
twelve years old, stands in the doorway to the garage, a
duffel bag slung over one shoulder.
She looks at Malcolm and
breaks into a wide grin.
KELLY
Hi, Dad.
MALCOLM
Kelly!
What are you doing here?
She drops the bag on the floor, and wraps her arms around him
in a warm embrace.
He responds stiffly.
KELLY
Vacation.
I'm all yours.
You didn't
forget, did you?
She pulls back and looks at him.
KELLY (cont'd)
Did you?
CUT TO:
KELLY is slumped in a chair in Eddie's office next to the
construction floor.
Outside the glass windows work on the
vehicles continues unabated.
MALCOLM hangs up the phone.
MALCOLM
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half
an hour.
You only have to stay with
her one night, she'll put you on a
bus in the morning and your mother
will be at the station when you get
there.
KELLY
I don't even know this woman.
MALCOLM
Well, I do, and she's fantastic.
She'll take you to the museum, maybe
to a movie if you play your cards
right.
You're going to have a
fantastic time.
KELLY
Stop saying fantastic.
Where are you
going?
MALCOLM
I can't tell you.
But I'll be back
within a week.
KELLY
My vacation is over in a week.
MALCOLM
I'll make it up to you this summer.
I promise.
KELLY
I'm your daughter all the time, you
know.
Not just when it's convenient.
MALCOLM
Very hurtful.
Your mother tell you
to say that?
KELLY
No, Dad.
I have thoughts of my own
once in a while.
From the construction floor, EDDIE calls out.
EDDIE (o.s.)
Dr. Malcolm!
Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace.
Quickly.
MALCOLM
Is that kid still bothering you?
KELLY
Which one?
MALCOLM
You know, at the bus stop.
With the
hair?
KELLY
That was about a year ago.
MALCOLM
Well, is he?
KELLY
No.
Richard talked to his parents.
MALCOLM
That Richard.
EDDIE (o.s.)
Ian, come here a minute!
KELLY
(to Malcolm)
I could come with you.
MALCOLM
Out of the question.
You'd miss the
gymnastics trials.
You've been
training for that for a year.
KELLY
I don't care about the trials, I
want to be with you.
I could be your
research assistant, like I was in
Austin.
MALCOLM
This is nothing like Austin.
Forget
about it.
KELLY
You like to have kids, you just
don't want to be with them, do you?
He looks at her, hurt.
Eddie calls out a third time,
impatient now.
Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up and
heads for the door.
He pauses guiltily.
MALCOLM
I'm not like you wan me to be.
I've
what I can be.
He leaves.
While MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
background, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
the windows.
They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire
mesh inside it.
She looks around, to see if anybody's
watching.
They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front
trailer.
Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.
It's
divided into sections, for different laboratory functions.
The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays,
dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video
monitors.
Next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of
processors, and a communications section.
All the lab
equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
slides into the walls.
Everything is bolted down.
She notices a large map on the wall.
Off the coat of Costa
Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
ink.
Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the
Pacific Ocean.
Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in
the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five.
Matanceros.
Muerte.
Tacano.
Pena.
And Sorna.
Underneath
the whole island chain, there is a bold legend.
"The Five Deaths," it says.
Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
of those three ominous words.
DISSOLVE TO:
It's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
post/living quarters.
The books are lined up neatly on the
shelves.
The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data
input.
All the way in the back, past the spare tires and life
preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one
storage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND.
A plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
bin's door.
A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old
daughter.
The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the
door pops open.
KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several
blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
liquid.
We can guess.
She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and
bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can.
She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.
A sign on the door says "RESTROOM."
Inside, a SIGH of relief
is heard.
CUT TO:
In the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch
sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition.
PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out.
In one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the
satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next
day's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist.
There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
photos, indicating where certain species can be found.
BURKE
If you're really interested in
infants, we'll have better luck at
the seaside, because the sands offer
a cushioning surface where the egg
clutches can -- can --
He trails off.
A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and
the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.
They look at each other.
The RUMBLING gets louder.
Outside,
someone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start
hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside
turn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent --
-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas!
The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has
flattened himself against the door, as far away from the
animal as possible.
SARAH
Ian, close the window, it's going to
wake every predator in the jungle!
Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
window.
The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
legs, ripping the flesh of his forearm.
He SHOUTS in pain.
Outside, the listening jungle whizzes by.
SARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
table and hold it down.
MALCOLM is right behind them.
MALCOLM
This is exceedingly unwise.
Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a
small syringe.
Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
baby's injured leg.
SARAH
Too late to worry about that!
Hold
him together, Nick!
Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.
MALCOLM
Just do whatever you have to do and
get it out of here as quickly as
possible.
Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
the animal's leg.
A green and white skeletal image appears on
a monitor next to the table.
SARAH
Okay, there's the metatarsals --
tibia, fibula -- there it is!
See
it?
That's a fracture, just above
the epiphysis.
They peer closely at the monitor.
NICK
That little black line?
SARAH
That little black line means death
for this infant.
The fibula won't
heal straight, so the ankle joint
can't pivot when he stands on his
hind feet.
The baby won't be able to
run, and probably can't even walk.
It'll be crippled, and a predator
will pick it off before it gets more
than a few weeks old.
MALCOLM
Can you set up?
SARAH
(thinking)
It has to be temporary, something
that'll break apart and fall off as
the animal grows...
MALCOLM
Think fast, Sarah.
The tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again.
NICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin.
MALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.
The animal
thrashes again.
NICK
Give it more morphine!
SARAH
We'll kill it with too much, we'll
put it into respiratory arrest!
I'm
almost done.
Damn it, I need
another adhesive, something pliable I
can --
Her eyes fall on Nick.
She holds out her hand, urgently.
SARAH (cont'd)
Spit!
He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.
The baby
rex CRIES OUT again.
There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer.
The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.
EDDIE (o.s.)
Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!
On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum
into place on the makeshift splint.
But the baby rex,
regaining its strength, is thrashing again.
SARAH
Hold it down, Nick!
NICK
I'm trying!
EDDIE (o.s.)
(from the radio)
Is anybody there?!
Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.
SARAH
Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin
and fill a syringe!
Quick injection
of antibiotics and I can get it out
of here!
Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
comes up with what she wants.
Working fast, he draws twenty
cc's of the pink liquid.
EDDIE (o.s.)
(still from the radio, now
desperate)
SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME!
They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
injection.
EDDIE (o.s.)
WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE
TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW!
Nick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
piece of information.
MALCOLM
Oh, Christ.
He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.
MALCOLM (cont'd)
Let me talk to Kelly, is she--
A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer,
followed immediately by a CRASHING sound.
They whirl and look
to the window, just in time to see --
--
the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side!
There is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in
response.
Outside the window, the head of a full-grown
TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside.
Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror.
The rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.
The
baby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back.
But across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX
HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS.
This one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles
anything in the trailer that isn't tied down.
NICK
What do they want?!
MALCOLM
What do you think they want?!
SARAH
That's impossible, they can't have
the sensory equipment to track it all
the way here!
MALCOLM
Current evidence seems to be to the
contrary, wouldn't you say?!
GIVE IT
TO THEM!
Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used
earlier.
He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it
into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a
fresh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch.
Sarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the
trailer, carrying the baby rex.
Outside, the two adult rexes
stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them
through the window.
At the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.
SARAH
Ready?
Malcolm reaches for the door handle.
NICK
Wait!
He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video
camera up at the door, getting the best shot.
Malcolm takes a
breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door.
Outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring,
surprised.
Although terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.
SARAH
(softly)
Born free, as free as the wind blows.
As free as the grass grows --
MALCOLM
Are you insane?!
SARAH
I swear to God, it works with lions
sometimes!
There we are -- your baby
is free --
The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the
ground outside.
Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door
shut.
The three of them freeze, not daring to breath.
Outside, they
can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they
inspect their young --
-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter
as they move away.
From the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.
EDDIE
They're going back into the jungle.
CUT TO:
MALCOLM is at the radio.
MALCOLM
Wait there.
I'll come up in a
minute.
Don't move, understand?
KELLY (o.s.)
I understand.
Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.
SARAH and
NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall,
completely drained.
Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
speaks shakily into it.
SARAH
Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
rex does nurture its young.
They laugh weakly.
NICK
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten
rule when a news crew is in a war
zone.
You stop the van every two
miles and decide whether or not to go
on.
Whether or not you feel lucky.
One "no" from anybody in the group
and you turn around right there, no
question asked, nobody embarrassed.
(pause)
Well?
Do we go on?
Immediately:
SARAH
No.
MALCOLM
No.
NICK
No way.
They all laugh.
MALCOLM
All right.
I'm satisfied with the
evidence we have right now.
I feel vindicated.
John Hammond will
too.
(to Sarah)
Do you have enough to publish?
SARAH
They will come after me.
But I can
collect some stool samples, for DNA
with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest
of you to back me up, it should stand
when we get back.
MALCOLM
(getting up)
Then the only thing left to do is
make sure we do get back.
I'll
call the mainland on the satellite
phone and have them send the boat
right now.
This expedition is over.
He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
phone that's resting in a battery pack.
The front panel
lights up, a brilliant green.
But from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S
VOICE breaks through, soft and empty.
EDDIE (o.s.)
Oh, God.
I am so sorry.
Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.
MALCOLM
What the hell is he sorry f-
A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.
Malcolm, Sarah, and
Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.
The
RATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates,
everything in it starts to BANG against the walls --
-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer.
They're all thrown against the far wall, there is an
earsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks
and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black.
The satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS
against the wall.
It lands on the floor, its number pad still
glowing green.
Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.
Outside,
the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window,
revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the
trailer!
NICK
HANG ON TO SOMETHING!
They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
for dear life.
The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
trailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back
down, and is
quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.
This time the
entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down.
Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
and drop onto the ceiling.
The tables, chairs, lab equipment,
everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them;
everything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM.
But the rexes aren't done.
The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION,
sliding forwards.
SEEN FROM OUTSIDE,
the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two
trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in
front of it.
IN THE TRAILER,
SARAH
They're pushing us!
Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside.
He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
as they move past it.
He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
they are being pushed.
His eyes widen at something he sees
outside the window.
MALCOLM
Oh, God.
SARAH
What?!
MALCOLM
They're pushing us over the cliff.
Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of
muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.
The three of
them look at each other for a moment --
-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
trailer.
The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.
They reach the
accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it.
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER,
which is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
it, pushing the front end of the trailer.
IN THE REAR TRAILER,
Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but
Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill.
The angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to
freefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head.
Malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.
Sarah,
starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,
getting a g rip on the handle.
The door, held by a safety
latch, doesn't open.
Below Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.
Through the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five
hundred feet below.
The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.
The
box strains on its power cord.
Still clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts
to come loose, swaying above her.
The safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a
shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
contents.
Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
trailer.
She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the
rear window.
The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.
FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW,
an enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.
Above, Sarah is a
tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the
breaking window.
IN THE TRAILER,
Nick SHOUTS to her.
NICK
SARAH!
DON'T MOVE!
Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her
senses.
She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below.
For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.
As
she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her.
She blanches; the world spins around her.
SARAH
OH... GOD ... please...
Her breath fogs the cracked glass.
Slowly, she tries to get
up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.
But as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS even
more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers.
The
whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the
trailer.
UP ABOVE HER,
Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still
glowing green.
Nick is closest to it.
MALCOLM
Nick!
Grab the phone!
SARAH
looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the
wall of the trailer.
She shifts her weight, leaning on one
hand to reach for the grating with the other.
NICK
reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches
from his outstretched fingers.
SARAH
leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out
around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass.
The
splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge
of the frame --
-- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass.
She GASPS and
pulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through the
glass.
NICK
has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer
shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.
NICK
SARAH LOOK OUT!
SARAH
lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
heavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass,
opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window.
UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER,
glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone
fall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below.
IN THE CLEANING,
the trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hanging
straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the
cliff.
Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumber
back into the jungle.
IN THE TRAILER,
Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating.
Above her, Nick
lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her.
ON THE CLIFFSIDE,
we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
out from the muddy cliff.
But now those branches SPLINTER.
IN THE TRAILER,
Malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers,
stretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower.
BELOW HIM,
Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen,
inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
purchase.
OUTSIDE,
the tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching down
again.
The bellows expands to its full length, stretching
like a Slinky.
INSIDE,
Nick knows he has to hurry.
He climbs down, bouncing off the
built-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah.
But Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet.
She
gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.
Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into the
frame of the half-broken rear window again.
OUTSIDE,
Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.
He
SHOUTS in through the broken front window.
EDDIE
HEY!
HELLO?!
IN THE REAR TRAILER,
The three look up from their precarious positions.
MALCOLM
WE'RE IN HERE!
GET SOME ROPE!
OUTSIDE,
Eddie turns and run back to the jeep.
He grabs a coil of
rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the
trailer.
IN THE REAR TRAILER,
Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
into the extended connector.
He peers over the edge, down
into the second trailer, and tosses the rope.
EDDIE
Catch!
The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end
dangling all the way out the smashed rear window.
But the
trailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.
SARAH
We're sliding!
EDDIE
Climbs up if you can!
OUTSIDE,
Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff.
He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
front grill.
Behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff.
Eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable
behind him.
He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for
its towing hook, the cable goes taut --
-- and he falls short.
Just by six inches, but he's out of
cable.
EDDIE
Damn it!
INSIDE THE TRAILER,
Nick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the
bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.
Malcolm is
further up, also clinging to the rope.
OUTSIDE,
dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
edge of the cliff.
Eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.
He turns
and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND!
Eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS
securely into the trailer's towing hook.
The trailer lurches
toward the edge of the cliff and stops.
But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure.
IN THE TRAILER,
Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks
them back, and their hands slide down the line.
SCREAMING,
they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
the remains of the rear window.
Regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them
now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer,
dangling over the rocky shore below.
IN THE JEEP,
Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to
get a grip.
The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
trailer back to earth.
But the tires spin, fighting to hold
it there.
ON THE CLIFFSIDE
Sarah and Nick dangle, desperate.
IN THE JEEP
Eddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
engine.
As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another
ROAR, in the distance.
And this one's not a machine.
But Eddie doesn't hear it.
He
GUNS the engine again.
There is another ROAR from the jungle.
Eddie hears this one.
He darts a look at the side view
mirror.
In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
the jungle behind him.
He GASPS and looks at the other side view.
In it, he sees the
OTHER REX racing toward him.
The tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep.
The first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and
lifts the car to its teeth.
But the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it.
Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and
the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground.
Eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get
away.
The gas pedal pops up --
-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff.
But the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape.
The trailers stop.
Now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie,
who still covers under the steering wheel.
The first rex
SNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully
exposed.
He SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its
teeth and tossing him out of the car.
Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their
heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he
disappears between their teeth.
Now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the
trailers drop over the edge of the cliff.
INSIDE THE TRAILER,
Nick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
the trailers fall around them.
The windows flash by as the
trailers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but they
hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life.
ON THE CLIFFSIDE,
the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three,
who pop out the space where the front windshield was.
Dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which
is now rolling to the edge of the cliff.
It falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
below.
Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the
surf.
The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly,
all green, red, and yellow.
NICK tunes the dial to a specific
frequency.
The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in.
NICK
(into microphone)
CQ, CQ.
This is InGen Operation
Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.
Come
in, please.
The remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their
flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the
communications room.
On the wall a row of chrome letters says
"We Make The Future,"
but the words are obscured by a tangle
of vines.
Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet.
On one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
Park would have looked like.
Big hotels, Ford Explorers with
tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds
at the fences around the animal exhibits.
But none of it came
true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered.
There is a pause, filed only with radio static.
Sarah looks
at Nick tensely, waiting.
Finally, a VOICE comes over the
radio, clean as can be.
VOICE (o.s.)
Go ahead, Harvest Leader.
They all breath a sign of relief.
CUT TO:
MALCOLM SARAH, NICK, KELLY, and DR. JUTTSON wait nervously in
the communications room.
An empty can of Dr. Pepper sitting
on one of the countertops begins to RATTLE.
They look over at
it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
formica counter.
Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too.
Glass jars
CLANK against one another, books start to drop off the
shelves, a stool shudders across the floor.
KELLY
What's going on?!
Above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into
the night.
They look up, a deafening ROAR fills the room --
-- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in!
As the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the
violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
heads.
Up above the operations building, the helicopter circles.
The
roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber,
impossible to land open.
Below, the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
the building.
They wave frantically, their flashlight beams
piercing the night sky.
PILOT
There they are!
The Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with
overturned cars and fallen trees.
CO-PILOT
No LZ in the street, too much debris!
PILOT
Check the other buildings!
The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of
the village.
At the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the
searchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story
building.
The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up.
Balancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches,
ready to spring at Malcolm.
Malcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open
between them.
He raises the rifle.
Th raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges,
knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him.
But the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window,
preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way.
For the moment.
High above SARAH, we see she is standing alone in a three
story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery
and other construction projects.
Catwalks lined with heavy
chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in
circles, wondering what to do now.
From outside the kiln house, she hears SCRATCHING, digging
sounds.
From the other side of the door comes an animal
SNORT, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
the crack along the ground.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR,
the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to
tunnel underneath.
INSIDE,
Sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and
starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the
ganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
it.
Sarah digs faster.
So does the raptor.
With about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs
hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
hard as she can.
It snaps off with a loud CRACK.
At the door, the raptor stops digging.
It's silent for a
moment.
Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now.
She starts to lower her body into it --
-- JUST AS THE RAPTOR'S CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER
SIDE!
Sarah falls back, SCREAMING, leaps to her feet, and jumps up,
grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above.
She starts to
climb, up, anywhere up, as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
its way inside, coming in through her hole.
Sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to
another.
The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.
NICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them.
They're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind,
probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
spend the night.
The room and staircase wind around a large,
open-aired central area four stories tall.
They SHOUT at each
other, frantic.
MALCOLM
We can't stay in here!
NICK
We're sure as hell not going back out
there"
MALCOLM
This is single-wall construction!
It's just a shack!
NICK
It'll hold!
MALCOLM
For sixty seconds, maybe!
Look at
this!
(RAPS on the door with his
knuckles)
You could-
With a CRASH, the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
swings open violently.
Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard
on the floor.
A VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway.
Nick throws his
weight against the door.
SLAMMING it hard against the raptor.
Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back.
SLAM!
The raptor charges the door again, this time BLASTING
it off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it.
The
raptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm.
Malcolm swings the gun around --
-- the raptor lunges at him --
-- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger --
-- and the raptor lands on top of him.
The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the
gun barrel now stands between them.
The raptor CHOMPS down
hard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS
its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands.
Malcolm pulls the trigger.
The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
its throat.
It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses
violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his
hands as it falls and dies.
Nick scrambles out from under the door.
Malcolm tries to
wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't
budge.
NICK
(helping him out)
Head for the roof!
MALCOLM
I have to find Kelly!
NICK
I think she's with Sarah!
MALCOLM
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
CUT TO:
Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and
lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent
light fixture.
One end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45
degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES
through a window.
