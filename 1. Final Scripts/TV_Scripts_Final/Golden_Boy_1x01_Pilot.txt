                                - SEVEN YEARS FROM NOW -

      INT. ONE POLICE PLAZA - 14TH FLOOR - DAY 

      WALTER WILLIAM CLARK, JR. (34), moves confidently, chest up, 
      down the hall of the Ivory Tower of New York policing.  His 
      stride is strong but with a noticeable limp -- 

      He wears a serious suit and tie in contrast to his baby face, 
      but Clark s not pretty.  And his Queens brogue could fit a 
      cop or a gangster.  Waiting for him is a journalist, PAUL 
      DALY (40), a quiet bulldog --

                                  DALY 
                      Commissioner Clark?  Paul Daly, New 
                    York Times. 

      Clark knows him instantly --

                                  CLARK
                    We have an appointment.

      He leads Daly into an office with the placard  Walter Clark - 
      Commissioner  --

      INT. ONE POLICE PLAZA - 14TH FLOOR - OFFICE - DAY

      High above New York City.  Daly takes in the view, and casts 
      an eye toward the stately desk.  Clark hangs up his coat.

                                  DALY
                      Congratulations on your 
                      appointment, Commissioner.  

                                  CLARK
                          (re: desk)
                    I see you eyeballing it.  Have a 
                    seat.  
                          (tosses an object to Daly)
                    There.  The full immersion 
                      experience.   

      Daly inspects what he was thrown: Clark s COMMISSIONER S 
      shield.  Glimmering gold, blue enamel, five stars across its 
      crown.  Daly sets it on the desk.  Old, oak.  

                                  DALY 
                    How does it feel, working behind 
                    Teddy Roosevelt s desk?

      Clark smiles, thinks --                                                                                       2.


                                  CLARK
                    Humbling.

                                  DALY
                    Like you expected?

                                  CLARK
                      I expected one thing when I started 
                    out, but getting here was a long 
                    road.  

                                  DALY
                    You re thirty four.  Three years 
                    younger than Roosevelt was. 
                          (re: Clark s limp)
                    It s been a quick ride but it s 
                    cost you.  You ve lost friends, 
                      colleagues... people that were 
                    closest to you.  

      Not something Clark likes to discuss.

                                  CLARK
                    That s true. 

      Daly sees an opening, lasers in --

                                  DALY
                    You call yourself a street kid but 
                    you climbed from Uniform, to 
                    homicide, to the big chair at One 
                    PP - the most coveted, high profile 
                    post of its kind - faster than 
                    anyone in the 170 years of the 
                      department.  So tell me 
                      Commissioner, are you a master 
                      politician or savvy cop?   

      Clark takes this in, deciding how to play it --

                                  CLARK
                    Know the parable of the fighting 
                    dogs?  Inside me there s two dogs 
                    at war.  One good, one evil.  Which 
                    wins?

                                  DALY
                          (finishing the parable)
                    The one you feed the most.  

                                  CLARK
                    Heard that my first week as a 
                      detective.                                                                                        3.


                                  DALY
                    Let s start with how you got 
                    there...

      He hands back Clark s COMMISSIONER'S shield.  Off it we -- 

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      -- the silver shield of a Uniform Officer -- 

                                        - PRESENT DAY -

      INT. BRONX BODEGA - NIGHT 

      -- on the chest of Uniform Police officer WALTER WILLIAM 
      CLARK, JR., now 26, with his partner, BASILIO CRUZ (30).  
      They enter and absorb an eerie quiet.  

                                  CLARK
                    Police Officers, hello?

      Nothing.  They remove their weapons and split up to search.  

      CLARK WALKS DOWN AN AISLE.  It s so quiet he can hear the 
        flourescents buzzing.  In another part of the market --   

                                    OFFICER CRUZ (TO RADIO) 
                    Central, 33 George, got a callback 
                    on that job?

                                  RADIO
                    33 George, callback is 212 triple 
                    five 8126.

      Cruz dials the number on his cell as Clark moves to the 
      counter where a PHONE RINGS.  Clark peers over the counter, 
      sees, on the floor, a ringing cell phone in a puddle of 
      blood.  A smeared trail leads to a dark storage room, where, 
      just inside the doorway, sit TWO BOUND AND GAGGED HOSTAGES - 
      an ELDERLY MAN who clutches a SMALL TERRIFIED BOY.  The 
      elderly man makes eye contact with Clark.  His eyes are wide, 
      darting back and forth trying to communicate  bad danger 
      inside.       

                                  CLARK
                    Heads up Basilio!

      Clark raises up his Glock toward the darkness of the storage 
      room, Cruz raises too but POWPOWPOWPOWPOW!!!  ERUPTS from the 
      back room and Cruz convulses and drops in the hail of 
      bullets.  Then FUMP! a bullet strikes Clark in the center of 
      his chest, driving him backward, wide-eyed, off his feet.                                                                                           4.


      The world spins.  Clark s down, mouth mawing like a dying 
      fish.  He reaches under his chest protection -- no blood.  
      Around the corner Cruz is lying still, face up.  Clark s on 
      his radio, coughing, wheezing, but clear --

                                  CLARK (TO RADIO) (CONT D)
                    33 George 1013!  1013!  Officer 
                    shot, send a bus forthwith!

      Then THREE PERPS emerge from the back room.  Automatic weapon 
      fire EXPLODES all around Clark.  A SHOOTER breaks for the 
      exit.  Clark spots him, instincts razor sharp, he raises up 
      and POW! drops the motherfucker.  

      There s two others.  But where?  Clark is trapped.  HE CAN 
      HEAR THEM.  HE S BEING STALKED.  He s terrified but focused, 
      eyes darting, he looks left, right, then up --      

      -- a concave security mirror.  He sees the two gunmen coming 
      at him from separate aisles.  Clark grabs his ankle gun --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Police, don t move!  

      In the mirror BOTH GUNMEN raise up to fire.  Clark UNLOADS 
      his Glock into one gunman while emptying his back-up into the 
      adjacent aisle until... he s out of ammo...  Quiet.  One 
      gunman lies dead in front of him.  Clark takes in the carnage 
      he s made of the man.  Holy shit...    

      AROUND THE CORNER 

      Gunman Two is badly wounded.  He s crawling toward the 
      automatic weapon that was blown out of his hands.  He grabs 
      it when -- a foot lands on it.  Gunman Two looks up.  Sees 
      Clark, panting, filthy.  SIRENS close in.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

      Officer Clark is in a hospital bed with a bandage around his 
      chest.  His sister AGNES (17), is by his side.  She s cute, 
      punky, awful skinny.  The TV is on, a newscast of the shoot-
      out with inset photos of Clark and Cruz --  

                                  NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                    -- the market owner had connections 
                    to Los Zetas, a Mexican drug 
                    cartel, and was using the bodega as 
                    a front to deal heroin.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      5.

                                  NEWSCASTER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Targeted for execution by a rival 
                    drug gang, he was bound and gagged 
                    along with two innocent bystanders, 
                    an elderly man and his grandson, 
                    when Officers Clark and Cruz 
                    arrived on the scene.  After the 
                    shoot out, Officer Clark, seriously 
                    injured himself, administered life 
                    saving CPR to his partner who is 
                    out of surgery and in stable 
                      condition.   

      Agnes looks to the hallway: a group of NYPD white-shirt 
      brass, chiefs and deputy commissioners are in conference with 
      the Police Commissioner himself.  It s a serious meeting.  

                                  AGNES
                    They re still talking.     

      Clark gauges the dour expressions --

                                  CLARK
                    I ruffled their feathers.

                                  AGNES
                    What s wrong with your hands?

      Agnes sees Clark s fists balled up.  It looks painful.  He 
      deflects it, ringing his fingers around her little wrist. 

                                  CLARK
                    What s wrong with this?  Why re you 
                    so skinny?

                                  AGNES
                    Let s worry about you for once.

                                  CLARK
                    Don t tell me you re back with that 
                    asshole drummer boy.  
                          (she looks away)
                    He is a drug dealing scumbag, 
                    Agnes.  And if you re skinny it s 
                     cause you re partying his poison --

      They re interrupted by a polite throat clearing from a 
      concerned DEPUTY COMMISSIONER RON BALA (45).  After Agnes 
      steps into the hall, Bala moves to Clark s bedside --                                                                                      6.


                                  DEPUTY COMMISSIONER BALA
                    Clark, indulge me... my kid s 
                    turning sixteen, sharp, good 
                    grades, he knows he s getting a car 
                    but he doesn t ask for a Formula 
                    One racer.  He knows he won t get 
                    it, and that he shouldn t.

      Clark gets the parable --

                                  CLARK
                    Sir, I was offered  assignment of 
                    my choosing .  I chose.

                                  DEPUTY COMMISSIONER BALA
                    Your colleagues would respect your 
                    bravery but no one would want to 
                    work with you.  You ve only been on 
                    the Job three years.  You ll be the 
                    least experienced by a decade.  

      Clark s back goes up.  Those two dogs Clark talked about in 
      the teaser?  This is where the evil one jumps forward --

                                  CLARK
                    Sir, you offered a dog a steak just 
                    to take it away?  

                                  DEPUTY COMMISSIONER BALA
                    You haven t made your bones --

                                  CLARK
                    Speaking plain, I made my bones 
                    from the age of nine stealing food 
                    for me and my sister, then working 
                    two jobs to get through John Jay.  
                    Now, last night, when that smoke 
                    cleared and those mutts were lying 
                    dead on the ground they re saying a 
                    hero walked out of that bodega.  
                    The Commissioner offered me a gold 
                    shield and assignment of my choice.  
                    I want my due.    

      Bala stares at him, tight-lipped.  Clark is almost surprised 
      at the words that came out of his mouth.  But doesn t retract 
      them.  Bala steps out into the hall and reports his 
      conversation.  A beat... then the COMMISSIONER enters.  He 
      takes in Clark -- 

                                  POLICE COMMISSIONER
                    You re biting off more than you can 
                    chew.  But... welcome to homicide.  
                      Detective.                                                                                        7.


      He holds out his hand.  They shake --

                                    - A MONTH LATER - 

      INT. MANHATTAN NORTH PRECINCT - MORNING

      Clark arrives at the busy precinct house with a bop in his 
      step.  The place is sixty years old, painted a hundred times.  
      Clark presents his shiny gold shield to the DESK SERGEANT --

                                  CLARK
                    Detective Walter Clark.

      He signs into the Desk Sergeant s log book --

                                  DESK SERGEANT
                    The hero himself!  

                                  CLARK
                     Walter  is fine.

      The Sarge grabs a NY POST from under his desk.  The headline 
      is  Hero Cop!  with a photo of Clark leaving the hospital.  

                                  DESK SERGEANT
                    Sign it for my daughter, Mr. 
                    Bieber? 

      He offers Clark a pen.  Clark gauges if he s serious, then 
      starts to sign when the Desk Sergeant throws the copy of the 
      Post in the trash as in:  fuck you, superstar .  

                                  DESK SERGEANT (CONT D)
                      Homicide s second floor.  

      Clark takes it all with a wry smile --

                                  CLARK
                    One day Sarge, you re gonna beg me 
                    to marry that daughter.

      Earning a snort from the Sarge.  And then, when Clark s out 
      of earshot, the sarge turns to the Officer next to him  --

                                  DESK SERGEANT
                    Just what we need, another press 
                    whore.         

      INT. LIEUTENANT KANG S OFFICE - MORNING

      Clark is across from LIEUTENANT PETER KANG (45), confident, 
      cool, a second generation kid of the street.  On his desk is 
      a stack of NY Posts, all with Clark s photo on the cover.  
      They beg an explanation.                                                                                            8.


                                  CLARK
                      Lieutenant, I know there s been a 
                    lot of attention around me but I m 
                    here to work cases.  That s it.  

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    Work cases and -- 
                          (re: an issue of the Post)
                    -- make First Grade in a year.  I 
                    read that too.   

      ...Clark looks down.  He did say that...

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG (CONT D)
                    You haven t taken the CIC or 
                    homicide investigators course --

                                  CLARK
                    -- I am signed up to.

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    -- you ve never served a warrant, 
                    and certainly never applied for 
                    one.   

                                  CLARK
                    I read the CIC manuals cover to 
                    cover, plus every article on the 
                    practical homicide website.  And 
                    boss, I m from the street so --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    You have zero experience in 
                      investigation and it s questionable 
                    if you re even fit for active duty.

                                  CLARK
                    The therapist signed off.

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    After a month?
                          (leans in)
                    I m from the street too.  I learned 
                    that if you got it fast, you ll 
                    lose it fast.  So your chance of 
                    sticking around is as slim as a 
                    papercut.   

      The Lieutenant retrieves another Post.  The headline is: 
       Speedy Recovery!  and shows Clark leaving a nightclub with 
      two girls.  Clark tries for an explanation --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG (CONT D)
                    Your desk.                                                                                         9.


      The Lieutenant nods toward the Squad and rises.  Clark takes 
      a breath.  This ain t easy.  He follows --

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      The desk is clearly the worst desk in the Squad.  On cue an 
      ANTI-CRIME COP walks through the locker room door which bangs 
      Clark s chair, as it will every time it s opened --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    You share with Coombs on 
                      Nightwatch.  If you smell something 
                    funny that s Coombs leaving his 
                    tuna in the drawer. 
                          (indicates)
                    Coffee room s over there.  Your 
                    partner will be in soon.            

      The Lieutenant moves back to his office.  Clark sits at his 
      desk and takes in the Squad.  He takes out his gold shield 
      and unsnaps the stiff leather case, taking in the shiny gold-
      plate and blue enamel.  Then, from the stairs --

                                  ARROYO (O.S.)
                    Tell TJ to lay off his sister or 
                    he s not going to Six Flags.  Love 
                    you babe, drive safe.  

      Then Clark sees DETECTIVE TONY ARROYO (35) enter the Squad.  
      He s Puerto Rican, snappy dresser, First Grade detective, 
      pure alpha dog.  Arroyo hangs up his cell and gives a quick 
      look to Clark, then moves to his desk.  The one with the 
      view.  This guy is impressive and Clark is star struck.  
      After a beat Clark musters his nerve and walks over.    

                                  CLARK
                    Detective Arroyo?  Walter Clark.  
                    New in the Squad.    

                                  ARROYO
                    I know.  

      Duh.

                                  CLARK
                    I ve been watching your career for 
                    years.  In the Post, New York 1.  
                    Doing the perp walk with Darius 
                    Block.   

                                  ARROYO
                    Yeah, you saw that?  Good.   

      Arroyo moves to the coffee room, Clark follows --                                                                                    10.


                                  CLARK
                    I m looking forward to working 
                    together.  I m not sure how it s 
                    shaking out but maybe we re 
                    partnered up.   

                                  OWEN (O.S.)
                    You re not.

      Clark turns to see DETECTIVE DON OWEN, black (50), gruff, in 
      a worn suit, bit of a gut.  The opposite of Arroyo.  Owen 
      drops a danish and coffee on his desk --

                                  OWEN (CONT D)
                    I m your partner.

      Clark s sugarplum-fairy dreams of kicking ass with Arroyo are  
      gone and his expression reflects it.

                                  OWEN (CONT D)
                    Don t knock yourself out doing back 
                    flips.  

                                  CLARK
                    I m doing  em on the inside.  
                    Walter Clark.

                                  OWEN
                    Don Owen.
                          (they shake)
                    I know you re coming in real green, 
                    but keep your ears open I ll give 
                    you a fair shake --

                                  CLARK
                    Two seconds?

      Clark moves to Lieutenant Kang.  Owen takes note of the 
      shafting.  

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Boss, I m sure you put a lot of 
                    thought into the partnering 
                      assignments --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    They re in stone.

      He hands a slip to Arroyo, now out of the coffee room --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG (CONT D)
                    Homicide at two-twenty fifty-second 
                    street.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    11.

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG (CONT D)
                    Arroyo you re catching, the rest of 
                    the Squad s on their way.  

      Owen s already on his way out.  Clark straightens his jacket, 
      follows Owen out --

      EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Clark, Owen and Arroyo exit the precinct where a PHOTOGRAPHER 
      and REPORTER spot Clark and move in --   

                                  PHOTOGRAPHER
                    Detective Clark, quick shot for the 
                    Post?

                                  REPORTER
                    Day one Detective, how does it 
                    feel?

                                  CLARK
                    Just getting settled.  Sorry to be 
                    short but we got to run.

      Arroyo and Owen take in the press, wondering where the fuck 
      they came from.  Clark notes their palpable disdain.   

                                  REPORTER
                    Something jump off?  

                                  CLARK
                    You know I can t talk about it.  We 
                    got to go.

      Clark moves to Owen s car where Owen has the passenger door 
      open for him.  

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  Been like this all month.  

                                  OWEN
                    Yeah, I get it.  

      Before Clark can get in, Owen slams the door --

                                  OWEN (CONT D)
                    What am I, your chauffeur?  Open 
                    your own damn door.  

      Cute.  Clark realizes just how it s going to be with his new 
      partner: shitty.  He gets in the car.  They re off.


                                    END OF TEASER                                                                                    12.


                                        ACT ONE

      EXT. BAR 2 TWENTY - DAY

      An Upper West Side nightclub, cordoned off by police tape 
      guarded by Uniforms.  Owen and Clark arrive and approach --

                                  OWEN (CONT D)
                    You know what to do when we get 
                    inside?  

                                  CLARK
                    H.I.C. hand book says we secure --

                                  OWEN
                    Nothing.  You do nothing.  Watch 
                    and listen.  

      Clark takes a deep breath, nods.  They enter --

      INT. BAR 2 TWENTY - DAY

      A high end nightclub, empty except for uniforms, Crime Scene 
      Unit and homicide detectives who are in the corner of the 
      club.  They re examining a DOA, TREVONN CLAY (22), black, 
      shot once in the stomach, lying between two banquettes, 
      hidden from view.  

      A FEMALE DETECTIVE runs the preliminaries --

                                  FEMALE DETECTIVE
                    DOA s Trevonn Clay, twenty two, one 
                    to the gut, nine millimeter shell 
                    casing under the banquette.  
                    Bouncer found him after last call.

      Clark approaches and takes in the body: the unnatural 
      position, the dead eyes, the blood.  He looks away ashen -- 

      FLASH CUT TO

      THE BRONX BODEGA -- Clark stands over the carnage from the 
      shoot-out.  The dead gunmen and Cruz, soaked in blood.  

      AND BACK TO --

      Where Clark s TRIGGER HAND IS SHAKING.  He clenches his fist 
      like we saw in the hospital.  He sees Owen watching him.   

                                  OWEN
                    McKenzie, Diaco, Dart.  Walter 
                    Clark.                                                                                    13.


                                  DIACO
                    I seen your face so much I m 
                    already sick of it.  Joe Diaco.  

      Clark shakes with DETECTIVE JOE DIACO (40), Italian, a Bobby 
      Cannavale type with a questionable set of blond highlights. 

                                  DIACO (CONT D)
                    That s Paul Dart.

      Clark nods to PAUL DART, who gives him the same back.  Dart 
      is dead quiet.  Like a young David Morse --

                                    MCKENZIE/FEMALE DETECTIVE
                    Deb McKenzie.  I ride with Arroyo.

      Said by DETECTIVE DEBORAH MCKENZIE (32), Long Island girl 
      with the map of Ireland on her face.  She s third generation 
      cop and not interested in pleasantries... with Clark anyway --

                                  CLARK
                    Nice to meet y--

                                  MCKENZIE
                    I got two brothers on the Job.  The 
                    younger one, Jimmy, was with you in 
                    the Bronx.

      Clark knows the guy.  They re not pals --

                                  CLARK
                    In Anti-Crime.   

                                  MCKENZIE
                    He said you were an arrogant 
                    asshole.

      Clark absorbs the blow as McKenzie answers a call --

                                  ARROYO
                      Witnesses?  

                                  DART
                    None stepping up.  Manager s 
                      collecting the guest list and 
                    credit card receipts.  

                                  DIACO
                    The bouncers said the tunes were 
                    loud enough to cover a gun shot, 
                    and, Richie Rich clientele, don t 
                    expect a world of cooperation.                                                                                      14.


                                  ARROYO
                      Surveillance?

                                  DART
                    The only cameras in the joint aim 
                    straight down at the till.

      Clark leans over to Owen --

                                  CLARK
                    Owner doesn t care what goes on in 
                    his place, as long as the 
                      bartenders aren t robbing him.  And 
                    rich kids don t want to get filmed 
                    doing drugs.  

      Owen glares.  Shut the fuck up.  Meantime, Arroyo s been at 
      the body --

                                  ARROYO
                    The DOA s questionable for this 
                    spot.  There s a meth market on 
                    13th.

      McKenzie gets off her call -- 

                                  MCKENZIE
                    I ll get the boss up to speed, have 
                    Narcotics do a sweep. 
                          (re: call)
                    DOA s parents were located.  
                    They re coming in.

      Arroyo and McKenzie head for the door.  Clark sees an 
        opportunity, approaches Arroyo.  Owen watches, baffled -- 

                                  CLARK
                    Something I noticed: the DOA s in 
                    borrowed clothes.  His wallet s in 
                    the back left pocket but it s the 
                    right one that s worn out; 
                      stretched, a little shinier.  So 
                    he s a southpaw but he borrows 
                    clothes from a righty.  I used to 
                    do the same thing.  With the 
                    opposite pocket always worn out.  

      Arroyo gives Clark a look.   No shit, Sherlock  --

                                  ARROYO
                    Monogram on the shirt doesn t match 
                    the DOA s initials.  That gave it 
                    away too.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    15.

                                  ARROYO (CONT'D)
                    Which is why I said he was 
                      questionable for the spot.  As in, 
                    he didn t fit in.  But thanks.

      Off Clark, absorbing another stiff right hook --

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - MORNING

      Arroyo and McKenzie sit across from JACOB and ROSEMARY CLAY, 
        mid-forties, black, blue collar.  Devastated.  Jacob does his 
      best to press forth but he s overwhelmed with grief --

                                  JACOB
                    Trevonn was a... Trustee Scholar at 
                    NYU... for the past year he s been 
                    working for the High Line.  The old 
                    elevated train track they turned 
                    into a park?  He called it 
                       recycling the city .  He always 
                    wanted to do non-profit work... 

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Do you know of anyone who d want to 
                    do him harm?

                                  ROSEMARY
                    He never said anything to us.

                                  ARROYO
                    Was he a regular at that club?

                                  ROSEMARY 
                    I don t know why he d be there 
                    unless it was with friends.  He 
                    doesn t have the money for it.  But 
                    he s resourceful.  Especially with 
                    an obstacle.   

                                  JACOB
                    You re talking like he s still 
                    here.  

                                  ROSEMARY
                    He is still here...     
                          (then)
                    I just can t...  

      CLARK turns as THUMP!  A large, worn, accordion case file 
      drops on his desk.  

                                  OWEN
                    The Dworaczyk homicide.  We re 
                    working it.  Familiarize yourself.                                                                                       16.


      (Pron. Vor-ah-chick).  Clark is baffled --

                                  CLARK
                    I don t understand.

                                  OWEN
                    More than one open murder in New 
                    York.  Ten years ago Jozef 
                      Dworaczyk, thirty two, Polish 
                      immigrant, was heading to his first 
                    day on a new construction job, got 
                    off on the wrong stop in East 
                    Harlem and got shot three times in 
                    the chest for no reason anyone can 
                    discern.

      Clark s taking in the worn file like it s an old turd --

                                  CLARK
                    So... it s a cold case?  

      Diaco trundles over, perches on the corner of Clark s desk --

                                  DIACO
                    Cold?  It s deader than Kelsey s 
                    nuts.  Which is what Kang s saying 
                    about your career if he s sticking 
                    you on Dworaczyk.  You re a threat.  
                    No one wants you.  But they got no 
                    style and they re not up to speed 
                    socially.  Like me.    

                                  CLARK
                    You do have a... distinct style.  

                                  DIACO
                    Any advice you need, or tickets?  
                    I m a ducat savant.  For however 
                    long you re around.

      Said re: the Dworaczyk file.  Clark regards it sourly --     

                                  OWEN
                    It s called starting slow.  

                                  CLARK
                    Or being put out to pasture.

      Owen looks away.  Clark looks back to where Rosemary Clay is 
      crying while her husband converses with Arroyo and McKenzie.  
      Moved, Clark goes to her --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    So sorry for your loss.                                                                                    17.


                                  ROSEMARY
                    Thank you.

                                  CLARK
                    We re going to find who did this, I 
                    promise you.  

      She nods sadly as Jacob takes her arm, and they leave with 
      McKenzie.  When they re gone Arroyo beelines for Clark --

                                  ARROYO
                    You got rocks in your head?  You 
                    never make a promise like that! 

                                  CLARK
                    What s the harm in giving her hope?

                                  ARROYO
                    What if we don t collar up or it 
                    winds up undetermined?  And it s 
                    not even your fucking case.  If it 
                    goes south I ll get the reaming 
                    while you re off pulling your dick.    

      Arroyo is in Clark s face, Clark gets in his face.  Owen 
      jumps up, gets in between them, protecting Clark --

                                  OWEN
                    He gets it.  Back off.  
                          (then)
                    We got someplace to be.

      Arroyo stares down Owen then turns.  Owen steers Clark to --

      INT. STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

      They head down --

                                  CLARK
                    I guess I overstated in there.    

                                  OWEN
                    You think?

                                  CLARK
                    Can we table this Vor-charic, at 
                    least  til there s a suspect on 
                    Trevonn Clay?

                                  OWEN
                    His name is Dworaczyk, junior.  
                    Just cool off.  Follow my lead.      

      Owen goes.  Clark takes him in, sighs, follows --                                                                                    18.


      INT. HARLEM BROWNSTONE - DAY

      Clark and Owen are with THEODORA PERRY (80), black.  Theodora 
      is at the stove, putting a kettle on --

                                  THEODORA
                    Just to warn you, something s wrong 
                    with the flame so it takes forever 
                    to boil.   

      Clark is miserable, impatient.  He gets a nudge from Owen to 
      open the pastry box he s holding.  Theodora paws through it --

                                  THEODORA (CONT D)
                    Now, like I said the last time you 
                    came by, I didn t see what 
                    happened.  Not personally.  But...
                          (gets distracted)
                    Detective Owen, I do appreciate the 
                    muffins.

                                  CLARK
                          (trying to stay cool)
                    Well ma am, if you don t have 
                    anything -- 

                                  OWEN
                    Take your time, Theodora.  

                                  THEODORA
                      I remembered something -- a word 
                    came to me -- I don t know why now 
                    of all the times but...  Mudd.  Two 
                    Ds.  M-U-D-D.

      Said slowly and Clark s crawling out of his skin.  He checks 
      his phone, frustrated at something.  Owen clocks it.

                                  OWEN 
                    Theodora, how s it apply to the 
                    murder?

                                  THEODORA
                    After I heard those shots go off, I 
                    looked out the window and saw a boy 
                    running away with that on his 
                      sweatshirt.  Mudd.  M-U --

                                  CLARK
                    -- D-D.  Got it.  The boy, how old?  
                    And was he black, white, Spanish?                                                                                    19.


                                  THEODORA
                    Black.  No... Spanish.  Maybe 
                    white.  Around forty-five.  

      Clark hangs his head --

      INT. DETECTIVE CAR - LATER

      Clark and Owen are driving.  Clark is silent, scowling, 
      texting.  Not getting the response he wanted --

                                  OWEN
                    Homicide cases move at their own 
                    pace.  You can t force them. 
                          (no response)
                    Are you seriously going to be 
                    texting like a teenager?

                                  CLARK
                          (not looking up)
                     Homicide cases move at their own 
                    pace.  You can t force them.   I m 
                      listening.    

      Owen LURCHES THE BREAKS, pitching Clark forward --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                          (looks up)
                    It s my sister.  She s ducking my 
                    texts.      

                                  OWEN
                    Why?

      Clark doesn t want to discuss this --

                                  CLARK
                    She lives with our aunt who wants 
                    to... maybe change the arrangement.

                                  OWEN
                    How old s your sister?

                                  CLARK
                          (impatient)
                      Seventeen.  It s a long story.  

                                  OWEN
                    Which you could tell me, then I 
                    could get to know you better.  Then 
                    I tell you something and --                                                                                    20.


                                  CLARK
                    She s with a smack-peddling drummer 
                    asshole who s a shitty influence 
                    and my aunt wants her out.  Which 
                    isn t something you d understand 
                     cause you only got sons.  Okay? 

      They ride in silence for a little bit, then --

                                  OWEN
                    How d you know I only have sons?

                                  CLARK
                    There s a College of Staten Island 
                    baseball schedule on your key 
                    chain, a letter over here --
                          (the door pocket)
                    -- from St. Peter s Boys High 
                    School hawking you for a donation 
                    and, the coup de grace, you got a 
                    photo of your kids on your desk.  I 
                    pay attention.

      Ah.  They pull up to the Station House and see a paddy wagon 
      unloading a STRING OF DOPE DEALERS --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Skells from Arroyo s narcotics 
                    raid.  

      Then Clark sees McKenzie and Arroyo with a suspect.  McKenzie 
      is carrying a gun in a plastic evidence bag --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    They got a suspect.  And a weapon.

                                  OWEN
                    Not our case, junior.

      But Clark isn t listening.  He s out the door --     

      INT. PRECINCT - DOWNSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER 

      Clark and Owen enter, Clark runs to catch up to Arroyo and 
      McKenzie but he s halted by --

                                  DESK SERGEANT
                    Young Mr. Bieber?  A fan to see 
                    you.

      The Desk Sergeant indicates AGNES waiting on a nearby bench.  
      Clark approaches her.  Owen continues up, watching Clark --                                                                                    21.


                                  AGNES
                    I got your texts.  But my phone 
                    died.  So... 
                          (she knows she s busted)
                    You don t know the whole story.

                                  CLARK
                    There s another dimension to you 
                    smoking dope in your room?
                          (she looks away)
                    Aunt Irene s got the extra space 
                    and time to look after you, Ag.  I 
                    got neither so this situation with 
                    her is working out.  We don t mess 
                    with things that are working out.  

                                  AGNES
                    I moved in with Jackson.

                                  CLARK
                          (cold fury)
                    No.  That s not happening.  

                                  AGNES
                    It happened.  I want my own life.  
                    You got your shield and your suit,  
                    I want this.  

                                  CLARK
                    That s only  cause you re too young 
                    to know better.  And this douche 
                    bag, this behavior you re into, 
                    it s getting way out of hand.

                                  AGNES
                     Try to stop me I ll disappear.  I 
                    will change my number and never 
                    speak to your smothering ass again.  

      A beat.  They regard each other --

                                  CLARK
                    And you just showed up here to make 
                    a stand?  No.  How much?

      She regards him coldly, then concedes defeat --

                                  AGNES
                    Jackson says I got to pitch in for 
                    food.  I owe him fifty bucks.  

      Ahem!  From the top of the stairs.  Lieutenant Kang.                                                                                      22.


                                  CLARK
                          (to Agnes)
                    This isn t over.
                          (gives her the dough)
                    Charge your phone.

      Clark heads up the stairs.  

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Clark sneaks in to observe Arroyo and McKenzie at work on 
      DEAUNDRE STUBBLEFIELD (25), black, dope dealer.  Diaco and 
      Dart regard him, then let him stay --  

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME

                                  ARROYO
                    Deaundre, the gun we found on you 
                    is same caliber as what killed 
                    Trevonn Clay, holding the same 
                    brand of ammunition.  When the slug 
                    we pulled out of the kid comes up a 
                    match to this weapon, damn son, you 
                    got sad days ahead.

                                  DEAUNDRE
                    I found that gun in the alley on 
                      twenty-third.  

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Account for yourself midnight to 
                    three AM.  

      Deaundre looks away --

      DIACO leans over, quiet --

                                  DIACO
                          (to Clark)
                    Book of Mormon, Knicks?  You come 
                    to me.  Later we can talk pooling 
                    contacts.    

      Dart sighs.  Diaco is kind of a lunatic.  Clark takes him in, 
      then looks back into the Interrogation Room --

                                  DEAUNDRE
                    I wasn t in that club.  

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Deaundre, talking vague wastes 
                      everyone s time.                                                                                    23.


                                  DEAUNDRE
                    I wasn t at that club.  I got 
                    nothing else for you. 

      Clark notes something behind Deaundre s ear.  A TATTOO.  Like 
      a squiggle.  Clark gets amped.  Eases out.

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - A FEW HOURS LATER

      Clark is ignoring the Dworaczyk file, eyeing the 
      Interrogation Room door, tapping his foot.  He s anxious, 
      excited, laser focused.  On his note pad on the desk he s 
      drawn a sketch of the tattoo he saw behind Deaundre s ear and 
      under it the word,  SIDEWINDER .  And then Clark starts 
      clenching his fists, like we saw in the teaser --

                                  OWEN 
                    Why re you so squirmy?

      Clark is shaken from his reverie --

                                  CLARK
                    It s my natural state of readiness.    

      Uh huh.  The Interrogation Room opens and Arroyo and McKenzie 
      exit and enter the Squad, and approach the Lieutenant --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    Is he our guy?

                                  ARROYO
                            (non-committal)
                    We ll see.  I d like to know why 
                    he s so zipped up.    

      Out of nowhere --

                                  CLARK
                    You want us to ride him to Central 
                    Booking?  

                                  OWEN
                    What?  No.

                                  CLARK
                    Just to get some air. 

      Owen regards this as highly suspect.  As does Arroyo, but --

                                  ARROYO
                    Don t go talking to him.  
                          (to Owen)
                    Got it?                                                                                      24.


      Clark watches this exchange, and notes that Owen stares down 
      Arroyo and Arroyo blinks.  Owen approaches Clark --

                                  OWEN
                    What s this about?

                                  CLARK
                    What was that about?  That s the 
                    second time you ve squared off.  
                    And the second time he s blinked.    

      Owen thinks a moment, then ignores the question --  

                                  OWEN
                    We taking a ride or what?

      INT. DETECTIVE CAR - DAY

      Clark and Owen are heading downtown on the FDR, Deaundre in 
      the backseat.  Owen senses that Clark is anxious.  They move 
      into traffic.  Clark turns back to Deaundre --

                                  CLARK
                    So... Deaundre, you re not just a 
                    dope dealer, you re a Sidewinder.

      Deaundre looks up, surprised to hear this from a cop.  Owen 
      turns to Clark --

                                  OWEN
                    Not our case, not our guy.  

                                  CLARK
                    The tattoo behind your ear.  The 
                    snake.  Sidewinders robbery crew. 
                          (to Owen)
                    They work out of Queens, started 
                    like ten years ago by a pawn broker 
                    named Dink Bosco, real lowlife.  
                    Gives you a little taste of the 
                    profit and all the risk.  

      Owen can t help but be curious --

                                  OWEN
                    That right?  

                                  CLARK
                    Lays out what house to hit, the 
                    entry technique.  
                          (to Deaundre)
                    You know he invited me to join up?  
                    In another life you and me could 
                    have been colleagues. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    25.

                                  CLARK (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    So you were doing a job last night, 
                    that why your knees are dirty?  Why 
                    you won t give up an alibi?  Now, 
                    we can go a nasty forensic route 
                    and match up your cell activity 
                    with robberies in Queens, or you 
                    can help me.  Then I help you.    

      Deaundre looks out the window, sighs -- 

                                  DEAUNDRE
                    Help me how?

                                  CLARK
                    You first, Deaundre.  I m the one 
                    with the cards.

      Deaundre sighs --

                                  DEAUNDRE
                    Yeah alright...

      Owen looks at Clark.  The kid did it.  

      INT. 100 CENTRE STREET - LATER 

      Clark finishes processing Deaundre and rejoins Owen --

                                  OWEN
                    Queens robbery squad confirms a 
                    break in last night at 16 Hollis 
                    Ave.  And they came in through the 
                    basement.

                                  CLARK
                    Wha d ya know.  Deaundre was 
                    telling the truth. 

      They head toward the exit.  

                                  OWEN
                    You saw that tattoo at the Squad.  
                    Why d you hold it?

      Clark knows he shouldn t have held back... but he s not sure 
      yet if it bothers him -- 

                                  CLARK
                    What s the difference?  I helped 
                    the case.                                                                                      26.


                                  OWEN
                          (stern)
                    You don t jump on another 
                      detective s investigation, 
                      especially an asshole like Arroyo. 

                                    BAR-LEV  (O.S.)
                    Hey Clark!

      Clark and Owen turn to see GEMMA BAR-LEV (25) a super cute 
      red-head wearing press credentials --

                                  CLARK
                          (to Owen)
                    Two seconds.

      Clark s about to head her direction, Owen stops him --

                                  OWEN
                    You watch your step with the press.    
                    They re all about quid pro quo and 
                    you are not authorized --     

                                  CLARK
                    She s just a friend.

                                  OWEN
                      A dangerous one.    

      Clark moves off processing what he just heard --

                                    BAR-LEV
                    Detective Walter Clark.  You re 
                    just as fine out of Uniform.  

                                  CLARK
                    First kind words I ve heard all 
                    day.

                                    BAR-LEV
                    I told you they d ride you.  Owen s 
                    your partner?  Very tight lipped to 
                    the press.  Distrustful.  

      He looks back at Owen, then --

                                  CLARK
                    I got nothing for you.  I m working 
                    the Jozef Dworaczyk homicide.  For 
                    the time being.      

      She scrunches her face --                                                                                    27.


                                    BAR-LEV
                    Call me if you get juice on Trevonn

      She leans in close and tucks a business card in his pocket --

                                    BAR-LEV (CONT D)
                    Friend of mine at Prada s looking 
                    to outfit up-and-comers.  Pay him a 
                    visit and meet me out tonight.  

                                  CLARK
                      I shouldn t be taking free suits.

                                    BAR-LEV
                    Meet me anyway. 

      She moves off.  Owen is eyeballing Clark, hard --

                                  CLARK
                    We going or what?

      Off Owen, ready to strangle his partner --

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY  

      Deputy Commissioner Bala, whom we met in the teaser, is in 
      conference with Kang, Arroyo, McKenzie, Diaco and Dart.  Owen 
      and Clark enter.  Clark moves right for the cluster --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Sorry to interrupt, but Deaundre 
                      Stubblefield?  Alibied out.  He was 
                    doing a burglary in Queens.  We 
                      confirmed.  

      Owen looks down in mild disbelief at how Clark handled this.  
      Arroyo hides his fury, stares down Owen --

                                  OWEN
                    The guy gave it up in the car. 

                                  DEPUTY COMMISSIONER BALA
                    That s one blind alley checked off.

                                  CLARK
                    My partner and I are actually 
                      investigating an old case.  This 
                    just kind of fell in our lap.                                                                                      28.


                                  DEPUTY COMMISSIONER BALA
                          (to Kang)
                    The Commissioner s watching this.  
                    So if the kid s got a nose for it 
                    maybe he ought to be working it.

      The Deputy heads out, with Diaco on his tail --

                                  DIACO
                    Just a reminder sir, I got easy 
                    access to the Nets --  

      He proceeds to kiss Bala s ass down the stairs.  It s real 
      quiet in the Squad.  Arroyo approaches Clark and Owen.  This 
      could get ugly fast... but Arroyo gives them a nod --

                                  ARROYO
                    Good work. 

      He heads into the Locker Room.  Lieutenant Kang is tight 
      lipped, calls to Clark and Owen --  

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    Get up to speed.

      He heads to his office.  Owen whispers to Clark --

                                  OWEN
                    Deputy Commissioner drops in once a 
                    year, that happens to be today?
                          (Clark shrugs)
                    And lookee here, now we re on 
                    Trevonn Clay  cause Dworaczyk just 
                    didn t float your boat.
                          (beat)
                    This the kind of cop you want to 
                    be?  Working the brass, the press?  
                    Calling in a photo op for yourself 
                    this morning?

                                  CLARK
                    I didn t do that.

                                  OWEN
                    Bullshit.  And you just confirmed 
                    it looking like a busted teenager 
                    with your hand in a girl s pants.  
                    If you re going to lie to your 
                    partner, do better than that.  I 
                    pay attention too.  

      Owen nailed him.  Clark absorbs it --                                                                                    29.


                                  CLARK 
                    The Commissioner s assistant is a 
                    cute brunette I took dancing a few 
                    times so I made a call.  
                          (off Owen: the truth)
                    And I made another for the photo 
                    op.  I got friends out there and 
                    none in this unit so I m using what 
                    I ve got.   

                                  OWEN
                    Playing this game, people get hurt.  
                    Bad.  You worst of all.

                                  CLARK
                    No one here wants me to make it 
                    past day one.

                                  OWEN
                    What no one wants is a cowboy.  
                    You re part of a Squad, it s not 
                    just about you.  

      Clark knows that but... the truth slips out of him --

                                  CLARK
                    If I follow every protocol I retire 
                    a third grader.

                                  OWEN
                    I m going to retire a third grader.

                                  CLARK
                    Well, I don t plan to.  

      They stare each other down.  Owen takes in Clark s ferocious 
      side, wondering what the fuck he ll get up to next. 


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    30.


                                        ACT TWO

      INT. FRIENDS OF THE HIGH LINE - OFFICES - DAY

      Pristine offices with a view of High Line Park: an old el 
      track running from the Meatpacking District to Chelsea, 
      renovated into a gorgeous walkway and botanical garden.   

      Clark and Owen talk with Jordan, a hipster white kid. Diaco 
      and Dart are with another employee.  Arroyo and McKenzie are 
      with MELODY (22), fashionable, cute, rich --

                                  MELODY
                    Trevonn worked up here at the 
                    office but down at the park too.  
                    He liked to help landscape along 
                    the walkway, by the old train 
                    tracks.
                          (then)
                    Like that would have any 
                      significance.  I m babbling.  

      Melody notes that Arroyo s got his eye on Clark and Owen --

                                  MELODY (CONT D)
                    You keep looking over there.  Do 
                    you think Jordan was involved?  He 
                    totally wasn t.  

      Arroyo shares a look with McKenzie, then engages --

                                  ARROYO
                    You know that for certain?

                                  MELODY
                    No.  I mean, yes.  I guess not  for 
                    certain.   Sorry.

                                  MCKENZIE
                    It s alright.  Talking to police 
                    can be nerve wracking.

                                  MELODY
                          (re: Clark)
                    That detective...?  I ve seen his 
                    picture.  He s famous, isn t he?  

      Arroyo thinks a moment, then --

                                  ARROYO
                    You bet he is.  Will you give me a 
                    second?                                                                                    31.


      CLARK AND OWEN -- are mid-interview when Arroyo pulls them 
      aside --

                                  ARROYO (CONT D)
                    This girl s got something on her 
                    mind. 
                          (to Clark)
                    She knows your face and I think she 
                    likes it.  Help us get over the 
                    hump? 

      Clark likes being wanted.  He follows Arroyo to Melody.  
      Owen s radar is up.  Clark moves to Melody, shakes hands --

                                  CLARK
                    Melody, Walter Clark.  I m so sorry 
                    about Trevonn.  Were you close?

                                  MELODY
                    I mean, I don t... we hung out.  
                    But everyone here hangs out so...

      Clark is studying her.  She s wringing her hands --

                                  CLARK
                    Did you want to be closer with 
                    Trevonn?  Did you like him?

                                  MELODY
                    Maybe, you know.  We were texting a 
                    lot.  But it was like, just 
                    starting.

                                  CLARK
                    But you had strong feelings for 
                    him.
                          (she nods, he takes her 
                            hand)
                    You know, it s not easy for me to 
                    let people in.  It s an issue of 
                    trust.  But when I do trust 
                    someone, if it s a friend, they re 
                    a friend for life, if it s a girl, 
                    I fall instantly.  She s the girl 
                    I m gonna marry, have kids with, 
                    we re gonna retire to an island and 
                    run a scuba shack.  
                          (Melody smiles)
                    Was that where things were going 
                    with Trevonn?
                          (she nods)
                    I m here to help.                                                                                         32.


      Owen is impressed, McKenzie too.  Arroyo watches close.  
      Melody wipes her eyes --

                                  MELODY
                    ...I just... feel so responsible.  

                                  MCKENZIE
                    How come?

                                   MELODY
                    I think this happened because of 
                    me.  Because I told Oliver Esten I 
                    didn t date guys at work, but that 
                    was so he d leave me alone.  Then 
                    when he found out about me and 
                      Trevonn... he got in my face and 
                    said such nasty things.  

                                  OWEN
                    Threats?

                                  MELODY 
                    More like insulting things.  Racial 
                    insults.   I m not good enough for 
                    you but he is... the field negro. 
                          (cries)
                    I told Trevonn.  And they got into 
                    it bad.  Oliver completely backed 
                    down, humiliated.  

                                  CLARK
                    Who knew that Trevonn would be at 
                    Club 2-Twenty last night?

                                  MELODY
                    Everyone.  Trevonn said he was 
                    getting all dressed up for it... I 
                    got there late... I couldn t find 
                    him.  This is all my fault...  

      She bursts into tears. 

      INT. HIGH LINE OFFICES - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      The four detectives convene.  

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Oliver Esten.  His grandfather 
                    founded Esten Steel.  Big money.

                                  OWEN
                    We ll need to invite him in nice 
                    and polite.  Don t want to spook 
                    him into lawyering up.                                                                                      33.


                                  ARROYO
                          (to McKenzie and Owen)
                    You guys handle that?  We ll meet 
                    you back at the Squad.  

      Clark is curious, Owen s protective --

                                  OWEN
                    Why?

                                  ARROYO
                    Just going to grab some coffee, 
                    Don.  
                          (to Clark)
                    You coming?

      Clark follows, turns back to Owen --

                                  CLARK
                    I think I got it.

      Owen watches Clark go with Arroyo.  And then we rack to 
      McKenzie and see that she too is concerned.       

      INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

      Arroyo delivers them coffee --

                                  ARROYO
                    Hat s off, kid.  Great work.    

      Clark s got Owen s warning in his head, but Arroyo seems 
      sincere --

                                  ARROYO (CONT D)
                    I m watching you and it s like 
                    looking in a mirror from ten years 
                    ago.  Hard driving, impatient, not 
                    afraid to step on toes.  

      Clark takes him in --

                                  CLARK
                      I appreciate the shot with Melody.  
                    But something tells me we re not

                    Me and your partner, we don t mesh.  
                    And I m concerned you re only 
                    getting his side.                                                                                      34.

                    His side of what?

                                  ARROYO
                     He tell you,  don t jump another 
                    guy s case.  You ll make enemies ?
                          (exactly what Owen said)
                    Jealousy.  The Squad are all solid 
                    but they can be cautious.  Diaco, 
                    good detective, but I don t trust a 
                    guy who knows what the Kardashians 
                    are doing every two minutes.  Dart?  
                    Very competent but not so warm and 
                    fuzzy.  McKenzie is solid but with 
                    the obvious drawbacks, as in  a 
                    slave to her moonphase,  and Owen 
                    is a dinosaur.  Locked in a 
                    pattern.  Trust your instincts with 
                    the guy.  You re the alpha there. 

                                  CLARK
                    I ve been getting that impression. 

                                  ARROYO 
                    Look, this case is dropping out of 
                    the sky into your palm.  Did I 
                    throw elbows when you walked in?  
                    Yes.  What d you expect?  But you 
                    got chops.  And you re making this 
                    case, so I m just riding your wake.  
                    You re golden.  

      He smacks Clark on the arm.  Off Clark, allowing a cautious 
      grin --

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

      CLARK AT THE WINDOW -- now confident, puffed up, arms 
      crossed, watching Arroyo and McKenzie in the Interrogation 
      room with OLIVER ESTEN (22), white, rich, a stranger to hard 
      work --

                                  ESTEN
                      A  negro ?  
                          (preposterous notion)
                    I never called Trevonn a  negro .  
                    What is this, 1950? 

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:                                                                                    35.


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Mr. Esten, were you at Bar 2-Twenty 
                    last night?

                                  ESTEN
                    No one hits 2-Twenty on a Tuesday.  
                    Rookie move.    

                                  ARROYO
                    You were on the guest list and your 
                    name was checked off.

                                  ESTEN
                    People use my name.  They know I 
                    won t show.  This is feeling really 
                      antagonistic.  

                                  MCKENZIE
                    We got a dead kid and people say 
                    you and him had a beef.

                                  ESTEN
                    We had a  conversation  about 
                    Melody lying.  Trevonn and me were 
                    tight.  Him dying is a serious 
                    shock.  I d like that taken into 
                    account.

                                  ARROYO
                      Absolutely.  But you need to help 
                    us too.  Because we pulled 
                      surveillance off an ATM across the 
                    street from the club.  You entered 
                    at 11:04.    
                          (beat)
                    Want to start over?

      THE OBSERVATION ROOM door opens and Owen enters, watches --

                                  ESTEN (THROUGH THE GLASS)
                    I went there.  Had a drink, bailed.  

                                  ARROYO
                    Why lie about it?

                                  ESTEN (THROUGH THE GLASS)
                    Don t want to be involved.                                                                                    36.


                                  CLARK
                    Esten reminds me of the kid of a 
                    landlord we had.  Slum building.  
                    One time he took a piss on my bed.  
                    He knew I couldn t complain to his 
                    dad or we d get tossed.  

      A beat.  Clark feels he s revealed more than he wanted to, 
      changes the subject --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Go ahead and ask.

                                  OWEN
                    How was coffee?

                                  CLARK
                    I don t see what you re all worried 
                    about.  You tell me to be so afraid 
                    of the guy but you re not.   

                                  OWEN
                    I just know what he s capable of.

      Clark nods toward Arroyo in Interrogation --

                                  CLARK
                    He s boxing him in. 

                                  OWEN 
                    That kid s old money.  If his daddy 
                    taught him one thing it was how to 
                    lawyer up.  Arroyo s gonna lead him 
                    right into it.    

                                  CLARK
                    You know, calling him out like you 
                    do... it s coming off as jealousy.  

      Owen takes this in.  Deep breath, patience.  

      INTERROGATION ROOM -- Esten leans back in his chair --

                                  ESTEN
                    You think you re sharp?  You play 
                    friendly, then fluster me?  I 
                    didn t hurt Trevonn but I wouldn t 
                    tell you shit if I had.  I know my 
                    rights and I want my lawyer.  
                    You re insulting.        

      McKenzie looks away.  Arroyo resists the urge to strangle 
      this asshole --                                                                                    37.


      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME TIME

                                  OWEN
                    I m certainly not jealous of that.

      Owen goes.  Off Clark... schooled.

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

      All the Detectives are present.  Arroyo is tense, he got 
      schooled --    

                                  DIACO
                      Ballistics confirm the gun we 
                    recovered from Deaundre is in fact 
                    the murder weapon.  But Crime Scene 
                    pulled more than one set of prints.  
                    On the clip was a print for a 
                    Ricardo Gaez.  

      He hands around a photo of Gaez s mug-shot --

                                  DART
                    Assault and possession.     

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    Any connection to the DOA?

                                  DIACO
                    No... but there s a possible 
                      connection between Gaez and Oliver 
                    Esten.  The ATM surveillance 
                    footage shows Esten entered with a 
                    Latin male, early twenties.  Could 
                    be Gaez.
                          (then)
                    Kate Bosworth entered a few minutes 
                    after.  That s unrelated.  

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    Address on Gaez?

                                  DART
                    On Stanton near Rivington.  

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    ESU will meet you there.  Get him 
                    in.  

      Just then a high-powered lawyer-type enters, ALBERT SHAY, 45.  

                                  SHAY
                    Albert Shay, counsel for Oliver 
                    Esten.  I m taking my client home.                                                                                    38.


      Lieutenant Kang silently tasks Dart to handle it.  Clark 
      looks up to sees Arroyo watching him.  Arroyo approaches --

                                  ARROYO
                    When we grab Gaez, how about you 
                    take the door?  You ready for that?

                                  OWEN
                    Why him?

                                  ARROYO
                    Why not.  

      Clark wants this bad, on the edge of his seat -- 

                                  CLARK
                    I ll take the door.    
                          (when Arroyo moves off)
                    I m not six.  I can handle it.

      Clark moves into the locker room.  Off Owen.

      INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GAEZ APARTMENT - DAY

      A grimy tenement.  Clark stands at the door to Gaez s 
      apartment in a bulletproof vest and an NYPD windbreaker.  
      Behind him are a cluster of ESU cops in riot gear, Owen, 
      Arroyo and McKenzie.  Clark is anxious, nervous.  Then Owen 
      sees that Clark s hand is shaking.   

                                  OWEN
                    Junior?    

      But Clark BANGS ON THE DOOR --

                                  CLARK
                    Ricardo Gaez!

      Nothing.  Then a rustling inside.  Clark directs ESU to RAM 
      THE DOOR -- they pound in --

      INT. GAEZ APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

      Clark s rushing through the apartment -- a shitbag but 
      there s a flat screen, Xbox -- 

      Clark s hand is noticeably shaking, he grabs it with the 
      other for stability -- a momentary distraction -- suddenly 
      he s grabbed and pulled backwards as KERPOW!!!  A huge chunk 
      of wall where Clark s head was is shredded by a shotgun 
      blast.  It was Owen who pulled him.  Clark is wide-eyed -- 

      FLASH CUT TO                                                                                    39.


      THE BRONX BODEGA -- Clark, terrified, scrambles for cover as 
      the aisle he s hiding behind is DECIMATED by gun fire.  

      BACK TO

      Clark shakes off the cobwebs --

                                  OWEN 
                    He s on the fire escape!

      McKenzie turns to the fire escape as RICARDO GAEZ (23), punk, 
      racks the slide on his shot gun, aims between her eyes and 
      KERPOW!!!  McKenzie dives just in time.  Out of ammo Gaez 
      flies down the fire escape.  McKenzie rises to kill him but 
      behind Gaez is a window into another apartment --

                                  MCKENZIE
                    There s no shot on him!
                          (to her radio)
                    Diaco, he s coming down!

      Clark bolts after Gaez.  He s going to get this fucker --

      EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - SAME TIME

      Clark pounds down the fire escape as Gaez gets to the bottom 
      level and DROPS ten feet to the ground.  Clark follows fast, 
      DROPS to the alley.  But where the fuck is Gaez?!  Diaco and 
      Dart are rushing up from the mouth of the alley --

                                  DART
                    Behind you!

      Clark turns and A BRICK IS SMASHED INTO HIS FACE.  Clark 
      stumbles but, eyes ice cold, he grabs Gaez, SLUGS HIM one-
      two, one-two and down goes Gaez.    

      Diaco and Dart converge and pounce on Gaez.  Owen and 
      McKenzie arrive.  Clark is panting, blood running down his 
      face.  He s a disaster but smiles big, hamming it up -- 

                                  CLARK 
                    Where s the cameras?  I m ready for 
                    my close-up.  

      Diaco chuckles, then the others, all regarding Clark with a 
      new respect.  Clark sees Owen looking up to 

      ON TOP OF THE FIRE ESCAPE: Arroyo looks down, his face 
      serious, maybe even... disappointed?  Did he hope Clark would 
      get blasted in the apartment?  Off Clark, radar up.  


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    40.


                                      ACT THREE

      EXT. MANHATTAN NORTH PRECINCT - LATE DAY

      Clark and Owen haul Gaez to the Station House where 
      Lieutenant Kang is waiting.  Diaco, Dart, Arroyo and McKenzie 
      arrive and approach.  Kang indicates Gaez --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG 
                    Get him upstairs.

      He stops Owen and Clark.  Arroyo takes note, expression cold. 
      Kang checks the thin cut across Clark s nose --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG (CONT D)
                    That needs a stitch.

                                  CLARK
                    I don t need to sit in an ER when I 
                    could be interrogating Gaez. 

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    Who said that was happening?

      The Lieutenant looks to Owen for an evaluation --

                                  OWEN
                    He duked it out good with Gaez.  
                    And he wasn t bad with Deaundre.  
                    Maybe worth a shot.

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    I thought Deaundre  just gave it up 
                    in the car ?

      Oops.  The Lieutenant takes a moment.  Then, to Owen --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG (CONT D)
                    You run the interview.

      Lieutenant Kang moves off.  Clark is thrilled, heads inside --

                                  OWEN
                    We got to talk first.

      INT. MANHATTAN NORTH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS

      Owen follows Clark, gets in close --

                                  OWEN 
                    Your hand shakes.

      Clark loses the smile --                                                                                    41.


                                  CLARK
                    At Gaez s door?  First time 
                    jitters.

                                  OWEN
                    Did it start after the bodega shoot-
                    out?  Where you got your gold 
                    shield?
                          (no response)
                    You re not going to therapy.

                                  CLARK
                    Yes, I am.  

      Then Clark recalls getting busted for lying --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                      Sometimes.  

                                  OWEN 
                    Junior, I know you want more than 
                    what s on your plate, but move too 
                    fast you re going to flame out.  
                    And maybe take someone down with 
                    you.      

      A beat.  Clark knows Owen is right --

                                  CLARK
                      I appreciate you saving my tail but 
                    we got a date with a dirt-bag.  
                          (sincere)
                    I m okay.

      He moves off, leaving Owen --

                                  OWEN
                    Remember who s running the 
                      Interview.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATE DAY

      Clark and Owen sit across from Ricardo Gaez -- 

                                  CLARK
                    Tell me about Trevonn Clay.

                                  GAEZ
                    Don t know him.

                                  CLARK
                    Your thumb print was on the clip in 
                    the gun that killed him.                                                                                    42.


      Gaez takes it like a punch.  

                                  GAEZ
                    I didn t do it.  I admit to the 
                    thumb print.  But that s it, the 
                    end.

      Owen catches Clark s eye, silently gives him a signal: lie to 
      Gaez.  Clark gets in Gaez s face, tips up his chin --

                                  CLARK
                    Look at me, you sad sack piece of 
                    shit.  Oliver Esten put this all on 
                    you.  

      Gaez registers this and tries not to crack --

                                  GAEZ
                    No, I don t buy that.    

                                  CLARK
                    You ran like a bitch and near 
                    blasted my face off.  I buy it 
                    easy, so will the judge.  You re 
                    dust! 

                                  GAEZ
                    I didn t do any murder!

                                  CLARK
                    You just touched the murder weapon?       

      Gaez looks away.  Owen looks to Clark who takes the signal to 
      sit back.  Owen pours Gaez a cup of water from the 
      Sparkletts, sits next to him.  Clark watches Owen s good cop.

                                  OWEN
                    Would you say Esten was your 
                    friend?  

                                  GAEZ
                    Yeah.  That s why I don t think 
                    he d say lies about me.

                                  OWEN
                    Do you know what you do for a 
                    friend?  You help them. 
                          (re: Clark)
                    If Walter called me in the middle 
                    of the night asking for help, I d 
                    run right over.  Because he s my 
                    friend.  

      Clark knows this is a tactic but it kind of gets to him --                                                                                    43.


                                  OWEN (CONT D)
                    I saw your place Ricardo, it s a 
                    pig sty, so you got to be hurting 
                    for dough.  But Esten, he s got a 
                    bridge named after his grandpa.  If 
                    he was really your friend would you 
                    be sitting here getting your ass 
                    cooked?  Let us help you, son.           

      A beat.  Gaez deflates --

                                  GAEZ
                    Damn me...

      Owen looks to Clark,  move in. 

                                  CLARK
                    How d you hook up with Esten?

                                  GAEZ
                    Clubs.  You need stuff, I get it. 

                                  CLARK
                    Dope?  Whores?

                                  GAEZ
                          (shrugs, yes)
                    Esten needed a gun.  He said he got 
                    into it with some kid and wanted to 
                    settle up.  But he didn t say 
                    nothing about shooting him.

                                  OWEN 
                    That s what you do with a gun, 
                    Ricardo.

                                  GAEZ
                    He said he wanted to jam it in the 
                    dude s ribs and freak him out.  I 
                    wouldn t have agreed to nothing 
                    more.

                                  CLARK
                    Then why load it?

                                  GAEZ
                    I didn t.  I got him an empty 
                    Glock.  We go to the club and Esten 
                    went off to do his thing.  A minute 
                    later he comes running back, 
                    shoving the piece in my pocket, 
                    saying  get rid of it.   I had no 
                    idea what went down.                                                                                     44.


                                  OWEN 
                    Warm gun barrel wasn t a tip off? 
                          (it was... but)
                    No ruckus in the club?  

      Gaez stumbles, then --

                                  GAEZ
                    There wasn t no ruckus.  You 
                    couldn t hear a machine gun over 
                    that music and if anyone saw it 
                    they just slunked out quiet.  I 
                    didn t know nothing happened.  But 
                    he hands me the gun so I ran and 
                    tossed it.  
                          (beat)
                    I got nothing against that kid who 
                    got shot.  I got... played.  

      He looks down.  Clark looks to Owen, gaining admiration.  

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - LATE DAY

      Arroyo, McKenzie and Lieutenant Kang watched the interview.  
      The Lieutenant s impressed.  

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    It s a place to start.   

      He goes.  Arroyo is silent, which McKenzie clocks.   

      INT. COFFEE ROOM - LATE DAY

      Clark is sipping a coke.  McKenzie enters and heads to the 
      fridge.  After a chilly beat --

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Nice work.  Better than my first 
                    time in the Room. 

                                  CLARK 
                      I appreciate it.   
                          (before she heads out)
                    We liked the same girl, me and your 
                    brother Jimmy.  I didn t know about 
                    his feelings or I wouldn t ve...    

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Uh huh.

                                  CLARK
                    Can you give me a little heads up 
                    on something.  Owen and Arroyo?                                                                                       45.


      A beat... 

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Three years ago Owen s informant 
                    got killed on a case.  A crackhead 
                    pross, one foot in the grave.  
                    Turns out, unintentionally, Arroyo 
                    revealed her identity.  

                                  CLARK
                    All this over a... screw up?  

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Official word got around that Owen 
                    was responsible.  No one could 
                    determine the source but there was 
                    a lot of name calling.  It was 
                    ugly.  Now they keep to themselves.

                                  CLARK
                    You got an opinion on it?

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Not one I ll share.

      Fair enough.  Then Clark remembers --

                                  CLARK
                    Jimmy McKenzie had a brother who 
                    died four years ago in the line of 
                    duty.  Your brother.  

      The hardest part of McKenzie s life.  

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Michael.

                                  CLARK
                    He was a hero.  I m sorry.

      She nods, heads out.  Clark finishes his coke, heads into --

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Clark walks right into Arroyo who beckons Clark --

                                  ARROYO
                    Diaco says every Wednesday Esten s 
                    at Tenjune.  No one here could 
                    blend in.  Except you.    

      Clark thinks about it --                                                                                    46.


                                  CLARK
                    Just walk up and interview him?  
                    Never happen.  

                                  ARROYO
                    If Gaez is being honest then Esten 
                    got his own ammo.  Meaning there s 
                    a near full box of it someplace, 
                    likely his apartment.  We just need 
                    leverage for a warrant.
                          (then)
                    Want to know how I got my first 
                    homicide collar?   
                          (Clark is intrigued)
                    Drove the suspect to Freshkills 
                    park, made him kneel in a trash bag 
                    and stood in front of him holding 
                    my Glock.  Would I have liked to 
                    play it cleaner?  Yes.  But I never 
                    would have got the collar because 
                    no one in my unit wanted to see the 
                    new, young, asshole do better than 
                    them.  So I had to fight for it, 
                    like a dog.  Esten s a racist prick 
                    who ll skate  cause he s rich.  It 
                    won t make unless someone shows 
                    some balls.  Fight for it.  My 
                    opinion.   

      Arroyo heads out.  Owen saw the exchange.  He doesn t know 
      what was said but doesn t like the intimacy.  Clark clocks 
      this, then his phone rings.  The display says  Agnes . 

                                  CLARK (TO PHONE)
                    What s up?

                                  AGNES (ON THE PHONE)
                    Don t go crazy.  But I need you to 
                    come to Kings County Hospital.  

      A switch flips in Clark and he s out --

      INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATE DAY

      Clark hunts the hospital waiting room and finds Agnes, in 
      sweats and a tank top, big duffel bag by her side, big black 
      eye.  Brother and sister have similarly fucked up faces.  
      Clark is seething, checking her face --

                                  AGNES (CONT D)
                    I need to put down proof of payment 
                    before I can leave.                                                                                    47.


                                  CLARK
                    Was it him?  The drummer boy?

                                  AGNES
                    No it was not.  Now let it drop.

                                  CLARK
                    As soon as you tell me who did it.  

                                  AGNES
                    I m tired as hell, and Jackson 
                    threw me out, so can you just lay 
                    off? 
                          (starts to cry)
                    It s been a really awful day.  

      If there s one thing he can t take it s her crying.  He hugs 
      her, kisses her forehead --

      INT. CLARK S APARTMENT - RED HOOK - NIGHT

      Small, pre-war, with a view of the derelict Revere Sugar 
      Factory.  It s homey but was clearly decorated by a young 
      man.  Meaning sparsely.     

      Clark enters with Agnes.  He carries her duffel, she carries 
      a suitcase, a backpack, a laptop bag.   

                                  CLARK
                    Just a few days...

                                  AGNES
                    And then I ll call Aunt Irene.  

      She plops on the couch.  He sits next to her.  A beat --

                                  CLARK
                    Do you understand why I get so 
                    upset?

                                  AGNES
                    You re a pain in the ass.

                                  CLARK
                    Because I get scared.  You act out 
                    with dope and older guys, and I see 
                    you on this shit path.  It s the 
                    path you get put on when your mom 
                    is drugged out and dad s a mobbed 
                    up loser.  And if it s going to end 
                    up anyplace other than Rikers you 
                    got to beat the odds.  But when I 
                    see your behavior that s the odds 
                    beating you.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    48.

                                  CLARK (CONT'D)
                    And you re too good for that.  So 
                    you got to fight, and get as far 
                    away and as high above it as you 
                    can.  Then even if you fall 
                      sometimes, you don t end up all the 
                    way back there.  Because that was 
                    hell.  

                                  AGNES
                    But all I remember is you coming 
                    home with food and coloring books.

                                  CLARK
                    All that was stolen.

                                  AGNES
                    I didn t know it then.  So this 
                    fight is easy for you.  You 
                    remember how bad it was, but this 
                     path ... is just me living.  

                                  CLARK
                    I know, but trust me... if you keep 
                    on it eventually it ll explode out 
                    from under you.  It s a time bomb.

      A beat.

                                  AGNES
                    ... what would you think of trying 
                    to find them one day?

      Clark takes this in, sighs deep, knowing how much this means 
      to her... and to him --

                                  CLARK
                    I think if they wanted to see us 
                    they d ve come looking.

                                  AGNES 
                    See, now I got you really scared.  

      True.  He is.  He heads for the door -- 

                                  CLARK
                    Get comfortable.  I got to step out 
                    for a bit.  

                                  AGNES
                    Promise you won t do anything to 
                    Jackson?

      The door CLOSES --                                                                                    49.


      INT. MARS BAR - NIGHT

      SLAM!  Clark drives JACKSON DELL (27) into the wall of a 
      grimy bar.  He s skinny, scuzzy handsome, tight black jeans.  

                                    JACKSON
                    I didn t do anything to Agnes, I 
                    swear.

      Clark s furious.  He spins Jackson, plants him into the wall 
      and gets to tossing his pockets --

                                  CLARK
                    First off, you re twenty seven with 
                    a girl who s seventeen --

                                    JACKSON
                    -- consensually --

      Clark has found a pair of HEROIN BINDLES on Jackson --

                                  CLARK
                    -- and you re a heroin dealer who s 
                    holding product.  So, we re taking 
                    a ride.     

                                    JACKSON
                    That s strictly personal use...

      Clark hauls Jackson out --

      EXT. MARS BAR - MOMENTS LATER

      Clark drags Jackson to his car and opens the back door to 
      stow him, but before Jackson gets in --

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    She came when I was bartending and 
                    saw me talking to a old girlfriend.  
                    Talking.  But Agnes flipped and 
                    threw down like a jealous psycho.  
                    My ex got in a shot before I could 
                    break it up.    

      Clark faces Jackson.  This could have some validity --

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    You think locking me up s going to 
                    solve her problems?  She s no 
                    angel.  

      Clark throws Jackson in the car and slams the door.  He goes 
      to the trunk and retrieves an evidence baggie for the two 
      HEROIN BINDLES.  He studies them a moment, a plan forming --                                                                                      50.


      INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

      Clark enters and sits down opposite Owen, working on the 
      Dworaczyk case.  

                                  CLARK
                    They authorize overtime on a ten 
                    year old case?

                                  OWEN
                    I work it on my own. 
                          (off Clark, why?)
                    I caught it back then and don t 
                    want to retire with it open.  So... 
                    I m busy.        

      A beat, Clark thinks, then --

                                  CLARK
                    Esten s got a rep for using dope.  
                    What if we busted him holding?

                                  OWEN
                    He d be a collar.  

                                  CLARK
                    And we d have some leverage to get 
                    him to talk.  Maybe get a warrant 
                    for his pad.  

      Owen nods, Clark ponders it -- 

                                  OWEN
                    But if someone were to plant dope 
                    on him, like a cop?  I d consider 
                    that cop as bad as Esten.  Maybe 
                    worse.

                                  CLARK
                    Well... I didn t say nothing about 
                    planting dope.  You brought it up.

                                  OWEN
                    I know how young men duke it out 
                    with their devils, and how it can 
                    cost them.  Dearly.  So just cool 
                    out, be patient.

                                  CLARK
                    Hasn t done much good for Mr. 
                      Dworaczyk.                                                                                    51.


                                  OWEN 
                    It ll crack.  And when it does I ll 
                    have done it right, like it should 
                    have been done in the first place.  
                          (Clark is confused)
                    You never even looked at the case.  
                          (he didn t)
                    Dworaczyk got shot early morning, 
                    September 11, 2001.  We couldn t 
                    respond for hours and when we did 
                    it was just two of us.  
                          (beat)
                      Dworaczyk s wife in Poland checks 
                    up on the case every anniversary.  
                    Someday I d like to call her saying 
                    we collared up.  So, he deserves my 
                      attention. 

      Owen goes back to work.  Clark watches him a moment, then 
      heads out --     

      EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

      Clark stands outside the precinct, thinking.  He takes out 
      the evidence baggie of heroin.  He thinks a moment, then...  
      he grabs his cell and dials.  After a beat --

                                  CLARK (TO THE PHONE)
                    Gemma, it s Walter Clark.  About 
                    that offer? 

      EXT. TENJUNE - NIGHT 

      A huge line outside.  Clark, decked out in a slick new suit, 
      walks to the velvet rope and flashes his gold shield.  The 
      BOUNCER checks it out, checks Clark s face, recognizes him -- 

                                    BOUNCER
                    Yo, open a lane, hero coming 
                    through!

      Clark enters past a gauntlet of jealous MEN and fine WOMEN, 
      the word  hero  rolling around in their brains. 

      INT. TENJUNE - NIGHT

      Thumping music, Clark walks through the bumping club.  Girls 
      are smiling at him and he nods back, he passes two of them --

                                  GIRL
                    He s that cop.  

                                  GIRL #2
                    Boy is fine...                                                                                    52.


      And these girls are fine.  But Clark s rolling like a shark.  
      Then two hands GRAB HIS LAPEL and Gemma Bar-Lev, stunning in 
      a red mini-dress, drags him into --

      INT. PRIVATE AREA - DAYBED - SAME TIME 

      She shuts the curtain and they come together like hungry 
      wolves.  They part a moment, she lies on top of him, runs her 
      hand along the cut on his nose --

                                    BAR-LEV
                    I like this.  

      He grabs her ass, starts to hike up her little dress --

                                  CLARK
                    I like this.

      She coyly hops off, straightens herself, all business --

                                    BAR-LEV
                    You re not here for me.  So you 
                    don t get to have me.

      Clark takes her in, impressed --

                                  CLARK
                    And who am I here for?

                                    BAR-LEV
                    Don t insult me.  Esten.

                                  CLARK
                    What do you know about him?

                                    BAR-LEV
                    Pig.  Rich.  Can t get a girl to 
                    open her legs without roofies or 
                    coke.  Is he your suspect?  

                                  CLARK
                    Am I on the record?  

                                    BAR-LEV
                          (wtf?)
                    I get you in locked-down club, new 
                    duds --

                                  CLARK
                    He s a person of interest,  
                      associated with a possible suspect.  
                    And you didn t get that from me.  
                    Where is he?                                                                                      53.


      INT. TENJUNE - VIP - NIGHT 

      A private party of ultra rich, decked out twenty somethings 
      in couture and big jewels.  Amongst them is Esten, red faced 
      and fucked up, sniffing a lot and talking a mile a minute.

                                  ESTEN
                    -- Jiu Jitsu evens me.  It s the 
                    only way I stay sane.     

      Esten turns, looks over his shoulder, spots Clark watching 
      him, sipping club soda.  

      CLARK -- eye-fucks Esten, then sees something sticking out of 
      his back pocket.  A playing card.  Esten tries to go back to 
      his conversation but can t handle the distraction.  He 
      approaches Clark --

                                  CLARK
                    Forgive me Mr. Esten but I can t 
                    talk to you without your lawyer.  

      Said loud enough for the party to hear.  Esten clocks his 
      curious friends --

                                  ESTEN
                    So this is about humiliating me?  
                    We got a bottle.  Have a cocktail.

                                  CLARK
                          (shakes his head)
                    We met with Ricardo Gaez.   

      Esten shrugs --

                                  ESTEN
                    He s a liar.  A broke thug.  Is it 
                    that easy to make homicide?  
                    Shooting up a deli full of beaners

                          (Clark is steaming)
                    So you re violating my civil 
                    rights, why?  Why re you here?

                                  CLARK
                    I m waiting for you to wolf up 
                    enough vodka and blow to blurt out 
                    the truth:
                          (right in Esten s face)
                    That you murdered an unarmed kid.

                    Trevonn didn t do a thing but 
                    you re one of those fat wallet 
                    inbreds with the mentality of an 
                    alley rapist --         

                                  ESTEN
                          (furious)
                    I swear I ll shove a lawsuit so far 
                    up your ass --

      Security is on them, separating them.  

                                  ESTEN (CONT D)
                    You got nothing on me, asshole!       

                                  CLARK
                    I got more than you think.  

      Clark turns and goes, winding his way through the grinding 
      crowd, holding the playing card he took from Esten s pocket.  
      Clark s got a big grin.  The confrontation was all a plan.  

      INT. COAT CHECK - NIGHT

      Clark trades the coat check attendant the playing card for 
      Esten s coat --    

      PRIVATE CORNER -- Clark has the heroin bindles he took off 
      Jackson Dell.  He puts them in Esten s coat.  Clark walks 
      toward the coat check then stops, his moral compass pointing 
      due north.  Is he really going to plant heroin on Esten?  
      Clark sighs... then reaches into the coat pocket, grabs the 
      heroin bindles and throws them in a nearby trash can.  He s 
      about to return the coat then hears something jingle in the 
      pocket.  Keys.  Clark thinks...

      EXT. ESTEN S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Clark is standing on the corner, staring up at a fancy upper 
      west side building.  He nervously jingles the keys --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                          (mutters)
                    He s using all his little tricks to 
                    get away with murder...    

      INT. ESTEN S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Clark breaks in.  He takes a breath, in it deep now.    

      INT. ESTEN S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                                                                     55.


      Dark.  Clark flips on the lights.  The place is massive, with 
      a winding staircase in the living room and floor to ceiling 
      views of the Hudson.  And it s disgusting, littered with 
      empty beer and booze bottles.     

      MONTAGE 

      - OFFICE -- He searches the desk drawers.  They re 
        disorganized or empty.  No sign of ammunition.    

      - CHANGE DRAWER -- Two hundred dollars worth of loose change, 
      just thrown away.  

      - CLOSET -- Clark finds fifty pairs of Italian shoes.  A line 
      up of fancy suits.  He opens a drawer, finds a hundred 
      watches neatly laid out. 

      - SOCK DRAWER Clark searches a sock drawer and finds a 
      collection of thumb drives, each labeled with a girl s name.  
      Clark winces.  God knows what s on them. 

      - DIRTY CLOTHES HAMPER - Clark empties it to see if there s 
      anything being concealed by the clothes.  Nothing.  He s 
      stymied.  Then, replacing the clothing in the hamper, he 
      hears a CRUNCH.  He stops.  He discovers the source of the 
      noise is a pair of jeans.  He reaches in a pocket and finds a 
      wad of lose bills, in the middle of which is a TAXI RECEIPT.      

      It s for two hundred fifty dollars.  He looks at the date, 
      checks his watch --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Two days ago.  Where do you go for 
                    two hundred fifty dollars?

      Clark takes out a note pad and writes down the Taxi medallion 
      number.  Clark knows he s crossed a line, but he just struck 
      gold.  Off Clark, fighting like a dog.  


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    56.


                                        ACT FOUR

      EXT. OWEN S HOUSE - QUEENS - NEXT MORNING

      Owen, carrying a travel mug, exits his house and heads to his 
      car, fumbling with his keys.  He looks up and jumps.  Clark 
      is by Owen s car, holding a bakery box --

                                  OWEN
                    What the hell are you doing here?

                                  CLARK
                    We got to take a ride.  Danish?

      EXT. MARTY S HOUSE OF GUNS - MORNING

      A rundown North Jersey gun store in a strip mall.  Nearby the 
      turnpike roars. 

      INT. MARTY S HOUSE OF GUNS - MORNING 

      CLOSE ON: a folded up paparazzi photo of Oliver Esten.  It s 
      laid out on the glass case of the gun store counter.  Clark 
      and Owen are in front of gun store proprietor, RONNIE (35).  
      He s on the store computer --

                                  RONNIE 
                    He bought a box of PMC Bronze Bulk 
                      9 millimeter handgun ammunition. 

                                  CLARK
                    Same ammo used to kill Trevonn 
                    Clay.

      EXT. MARTY S HOUSE OF GUNS - MORNING

      Clark s like a guy who s struck gold --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Why would he buy ammo unless he 
                    planned to shoot someone?  No way 
                    Esten could even call it an 
                    accident.  He cabbed it out to 
                    Jersey to buy ammo then went to the 
                    club to kill Trevonn Clay.   
                    Straight up murder.

      Owen hears in, processes the information --

                                  OWEN
                    That s about as good a piece of 
                      circumstantial evidence as we re 
                    going to get.                                                                                     57.


      Clark has a massive smile --

                                  CLARK
                    Who gets a homicide collar their 
                    second day in the unit?  Tell me 
                    that s not...
                          (Owen is cold)
                    What?

                                  OWEN
                    How d you wind up here?  Give me 
                    the links of the chain.

      A beat --

                                  CLARK
                    I told you, I figured he bought 
                    ammo so I canvassed gun stores --

                                  OWEN 
                    Way the hell out in North Jersey?  
                    And you said he  cabbed it out 
                    here ?  How d you come to that?
                          (Clark is pensive)
                    Don t make me interrogate you, 
                    junior.

                                  CLARK
                    I got information that Esten took a 
                    two hundred and fifty dollar cab 
                    ride two days ago.  I checked with 
                    the cab company and they gave me 
                    this place.

                                  OWEN
                    Who told you this information and 
                    how d you know what cab company?  

                                  CLARK
                    It was on the receipt.

                                  OWEN
                    Which you got from where?

      A beat --

                                  CLARK
                    Esten s apartment.

                                  OWEN
                    You broke in?!                                                                                        58.


                                  CLARK
                    I evened the score.  That rich 
                    prick is using every trick to dodge 
                    a murder, so I used a little trick 
                    of my own. 

      Owen is reeling --

                                  OWEN
                    All this information, useless.  If 
                    it gets out he walks.  And you 
                    dragged me into it.
                          (seething)
                    Two more damn years and I m done.  
                    You will not screw that up for me.  
                    You made it to the unit on luck but 
                    maturity and patience is what gets 
                    you to belong.  You got neither.  
                    Learn or get out, junior.
                          (beat)
                    You go home and don t say a word 
                    about any of this.  

      Off Clark, head spinning --

      INT. CLARK S BROOKLYN APARTMENT - MORNING

      Clark walks into the apartment... what the fuck just 
      happened?  He drops into a chair, taking in his sister 
      sleeping on the couch.  He hears MEWING.  There s a KITTEN at 
      his feet.  Clark picks up the kitty, looks it in the eye --

                                  CLARK
                    Where d you come from?

                                  AGNES
                          (stirring)
                    I took a walk last night.  She was 
                    crying in an alley.  I m calling 
                    her Clementine.  What s wrong?

      A beat --

                                  CLARK
                    I screwed up.

                                  AGNES
                    You ll fix it.  You always fix it.  

      Clark takes her in, sighs.  That s her perspective and he 
      doesn t want it to crumble.  He pets the kitty.

                                  CLARK
                    I don t know.                                                                                    59.


      Clark s phone buzzes.  It s a text from Bar-Lev.  It reads: 
       I don t know how this happened.  Please believe me.    Agnes 
      is reading over his shoulder --

                                  AGNES
                    How  what  happened?

      Clark gets a sinking feeling.  He goes to his laptop, opens 
      up the NY Post website, sees the headline on that morning s 
      Post:  Heir Apparent-Ly Involved In Murder  -- with a photo 
      of Oliver Esten.  It s got Bar-Lev s byline.  Clark 
      frantically opens to the article, sees:  ...according to 
      homicide Detective Walter Clark, Esten is a prime suspect in 
      the murder.   Clark s stomach sinks --

      INT. LIEUTENANT KANG S OFFICE - DAY

      Kang has a copy of the Post, and he s barking at Owen --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    I said watch him like a hawk and 
                    this happens?!  

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

      Clark is on his phone --

                                  CLARK (TO THE PHONE)
                    -- there s only two people in the 
                      department authorized to comment on 
                    an open case; the Commissioner and 
                    the DCPI.  I am neither of those!

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. NEW YORK POST - CITY DESK - SAME TIME

      Bar-Lev is on the phone at her desk --

                                    BAR-LEV (TO THE PHONE)
                    I did not put your name in that 
                    article, Clark.  One of the city 
                    editors must ve, I don t know why --

                                  CLARK
                    How does that happen?

                                    BAR-LEV
                    Someone calls in a favor.  Someone 
                    with juice who doesn t like you.  
                    You ve got an enemy.  Good luck.    

      Clark hang up, his world collapsing.  Owen is out of the 
        Lieutenant s office --                                                                                    60.


                                  OWEN
                      Lieutenant s getting calls from the 
                      Commissioner, burning his ass.  
                    It s time to cover yours.  
                          (leans in)
                    What did I say to you about this 
                     game ?    

      Clark looks over, sees Arroyo and McKenzie top the stairs, 
      then Oliver Esten with Albert Shay --  

                                  CLARK
                    Esten s back in?  What s going on?

                                  OWEN
                    Just steer clear --

      But Clark s on his way to the Observation Room.  

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Clark enters and all eyes go to him.  Diaco, Dart, and 
      Lieutenant Kang.  They turn back to watching Arroyo and 
      McKenzie in with Esten and his attorney, Albert Shay -- 

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME

                    My client told you, he s never been

                    You couldn t drag me to Jersey with

                    account Mr. Esten has at Dry Rite, 
                    dry cleaners on 57th street.                                                                                    61.


                                  SHAY
                    Why?

                                  MCKENZIE
                    We recovered a bloody shirt from a 
                    dumpster two blocks from Mr. 
                    Esten s apartment.  It s the same 
                    shirt he was wearing in 
                      surveillance footage entering the 
                    club and it has an ironed in 
                    barcode from Dry Rite tracing back 
                    to his account.   

                                  ESTEN
                    This is bullshit!  It s entrapment!  
                    That cop who got in my face at the 
                    club, he did this! 

                                  MCKENZIE
                    Blood on the shirt is confirmed 
                    same type as Trevonn Clay and the 
                    lab s running it for DNA and 
                    gunpowder residue.  

                                  ARROYO
                    We ve got a few hours on that, at 
                    which time the DA will authorize an 
                    arrest.  Until then...  
                          (fucking with Esten)
                    ...care to make a statement?

      Esten is fucked, baffled.  He looks to his lawyer who s 
      equally nonplussed.

                                  SHAY
                    Don t say a fucking word.

      Esten couldn t if he tried.  Arroyo is eating it up.  

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME TIME

      Off Clark, watching his collar going to someone else.   

      INT. COFFEE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Owen is pouring himself coffee.  Clark enters --

                                  OWEN 
                    Anonymous tip sent Arroyo and 
                    McKenzie to Marty s House of Guns.  
                          (off Clark s bafflement)
                    The case won t make unless the 
                      ammunition evidence comes from 
                    outside of you.                                                                                      62.


                                  CLARK
                    Arroyo sold out your informant, 
                    sold you out, and you feed him a 
                    collar?  My collar? --

      Owen is even, but very stern --

                                  OWEN
                    Trevonn Clay has a mother, a 
                    father, two brothers.  They don t 
                    give a damn about my past with 
                    Arroyo.  It s got nothing to do 
                    with the work.  That is all that 
                    matters.  

      Owen steps out, leaving Clark to ponder his first big league 
      lesson in homicide.

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

      Owen s at his desk.  Clark sits opposite Owen, stunned, the 
      Post drops on the desk next to him.  He looks up.  It s 
      Lieutenant Kang.  Before Clark can speak --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    Get with your Union Delegate.  
                    You re gonna need him. 

      Kang goes.  Arroyo stops at Clark s desk, wearing a shitty 
      little smirk.  He taps the copy of the Post --

                                  ARROYO
                    Got to be careful who you talk to.  

      Arroyo walks into the locker room, the door bumping Clark s 
      chair.  A penny drops for Clark --

                                  CLARK
                    Arroyo set me up.  Made it look 
                    like I tipped off the press.  

                                  OWEN
                    He s got a lot of contacts and it s 
                    something he d do.  Like I tried to 
                    tell you five times.  

      Clark is stunned.  MCKENZIE, at her desk, overheard the 
      previous.  She looks up to see Rosemary and Jacob Clay 
      arriving in the Squad.  Arroyo moves to her -- 

                                  ARROYO
                    The Clays are going to tail us to 
                    Esten s arraignment.  Heavy press 
                    outside.  Ready to walk him out?                                                                                      63.


                                  MCKENZIE
                    Do it yourself.

      She moves off.  Arroyo is baffled.  What s her problem?    

      INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT

      Clark is at a window, by the Sergeant s desk.  He watches 
      Arroyo doing the perp walk with Esten who cowers to keep his 
      head down.  The Clays walk out afterward and get into their 
      car, helped by Arroyo, their shining knight.  FLASHBULBS POP, 
      NEWS CAMERAS ROLL.  And Clark is stuck inside.  He hears --

                                  DART
                    Killer s getting locked up.  That s 
                    all that matters.
                          (cold comfort)
                    Your shaky hand.  I had the same 
                    after Afghanistan.  I know where 
                    your head is.

                                  CLARK
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about.

                                  DART
                    I had fifteen confirmed kills.      
                          (then)
                    Your partner s at the shooting 
                    range.  Go squeeze off some rounds.  
                    Do your head some good.   

      INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT 

      McKenzie in shorts and a tank top, answers the door.  Arroyo 
      is there.  She lets him in.  He shrugs, what s the problem? 

                                  MCKENZIE
                    That was a snake move, what you did 
                    to Clark.  You re better than that.

      He sees she s upset, puts his hands on her shoulders --

                                  ARROYO
                    With a guy like him you got to set 
                    the rules early.  Show him who s 
                    pride leader then give him room.  
                    It s done now. 
                          (re: her shoulders)
                    You re all knotted up.

                                  MCKENZIE
                    That a neat segue into your sure 
                    fire tension relief method?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    64.

                                  MCKENZIE (CONT'D)
                    The twenty minute cure, then home 
                    to Lorraine?  

                                  ARROYO
                    She took the kids to the Pocanos.  
                    I can stay all night.  

      McKenzie studies him.  She wants to tell him to go, but --

                                  MCKENZIE
                    I don t know why...

      But then they kiss.  He pulls off her tank top, she pulls off 
      his shirt.  They get down to it.

      INT. SHOOTING RANGE - LATE DAY

      Clark finds Owen at the range.  It s tense.  

                                  CLARK
                    The boss said I need to get with my 
                    delegate.  I don t know who it is.

                                  OWEN
                    You re talking to him.
                          (off Clark s relief)
                    Three boys and twenty three years 
                    on the Job s exposed me to a lot of 
                    human nature.  A lot of surprises.  
                    But one thing s always held true: 
                    inside every man there s two dogs 
                    fighting.  One good, one evil.  
                    Know which wins?  The one you feed 
                    the most.
                          (beat)
                    The sooner you get past your pit-
                    bull pride you ll be teachable.  
                    But until then... 
                          (he eases off)
                    Fired your weapon since the shoot-
                    out?

      Clark shakes his head.  Owen steps aside.  Clark steps up --

                                  CLARK
                    I m fine.
                          (he stops)
                    At least, I tell the shrink I am.

                                  OWEN
                    You ll get there.  

      Clark considers, then steels himself --                                                                                    65.


                                  CLARK
                    No, I am there. 

                                  OWEN
                    Junior, you re dangerous.  To 
                    yourself, to me, your Squad.  

      Clark takes aim and... POWPOWPOW! puts three holes in his 
      target, right through the heart.  Clark sighs, relieved.  

                                - SEVEN YEARS FROM NOW -

      EXT. ONE POLICE PLAZA - COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE - DAY

      Clark (33) is looking out at the view of New York --

                                  DALY
                    That s how you got the scar?  From 
                    the brick?
                          (off Clark s nod)
                    At that point was there any hint of 
                    how bad things would get with 
                    Arroyo and Owen?  Or that murder 
                    suicide, or the precinct shoot out? 

      Clark shakes his head, introspective, a little sad --

                                  CLARK
                    I had no idea what was coming.  But 
                    like I said, it was a long road.  
                    Next question?

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK


                                        THE END
