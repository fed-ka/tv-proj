A simple CAMERA, snapping away furiously in the hands of a
giggling MARK O'DONNELL, 4.
He's straddling and in the face
of his dad, KENNY O'DONNELL, 30's, tough, Boston-Irish, with
a prodigious case of morning hair.
Kenny awakens, red-eyed.
HELEN (O.S.)
Mark, get off your father!
Kenny sits up to the morning bedlam of the O'Donnell house.
KIDS screech, doors bang all over.
Kenny pushes Mark over,
rolls out of bed, snatches up the corners of the blanket and
hoists Mark over his shoulder in a screaming, kicking bundle.
Kenny, with Mark in the bundle on his shoulder, meets his
wife HELEN going the other way in the hall with LITTLE HELEN,
1, in her arms.
KENNY
Hi, hon.
They kiss in passing.
Daughter KATHY, 12, races by in angry
pursuit of her twin, KEVIN, 12.
HELEN
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk
to you this afternoon about Kevin.
You
need to do something about this.
KENNY
Kids are supposed to get detention.
Kenny dumps the bundle with Mark in a big pile of dirty
laundry.
SMASH CUT TO:
A kitchen out of the late 1950's.
Kenny drinks coffee, ties
a tie, rifles through a briefcase at the kitchen table.
The
horde of kids, ages 2-14, breakfast on an array of period
food.
Kenny grills the kids while he goes over papers.
KENNY
Secretary of Defense...
KEVIN
Dean Rusk!
KENNY
Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
KENNY JR. smirk at Kevin.
KENNY JR.
Rusk is State, moron.
Robert McNamara.
HELEN
Got time for pancakes?
KENNY
Nope.
Attorney General?
A PHONE RINGS as the kids cry out en masse.
KIDS
(chorus)
Too easy!
Bobby, Bobby Kennedy!
Kenny glances up at the wall.
There are two phones, side by
side.
One RED, one BLACK.
It's the black one ringing.
Helen answers.
Kenny goes back to his papers.
KENNY
All right, wise guys, Assistant
Secretary of State for Latin America...
SMASH CUT TO:
A bespectacled OPERATIONS MANAGER hands a clipboard to one of
the big Marine Guards who in turn hands him a set of keys.
The Manager unlocks the film cases.
PHOTO INTERPRETERS swoop
in, whisk away the contents: SPOOLS OF FILM.
SMASH CUT TO:
CLOSE ON the five-thousand rolls of film spewing through
processing equipment, its streaking passage leading us
straight through the development machinery to:
A SERIES OF VARIOUS SHOTS:
Photo Interpreters power up light tables, stereoscopic
viewers, zip across the floor in wheeled chairs.
Flying switches, flickering lights, humming motors.
It's an
eerie dance of technological black magic.
Another pair of Interpreters loom out of the darkness, side
by side, ghostly looking, their glasses reflecting the glare
of the light table, like magicians staring into a crystal
ball.
IMAGES FILL THE SCREEN
Aerial shots, flashing by.
Cuban countryside from 72,500
feet.
A MAGNIFYING GLASS swings down on its arm in front of
us, magnifying the carpet of trees... and a row of six canvas
covered OBJECTS among them.
SMASH CUT TO:
Kenny, briefcase in hand, weaves his way through the empty,
ornate hallways of the West Wing.
Past magnificent doorways,
early American furniture, paintings.
He finally reaches a
doorway, goes through into:
A long, narrow affair, window at the back looking out into
the Rose Garden.
Kenny dumps his briefcase on the desk,
shucks off his coat, removes a folder from his briefcase,
turns and heads back out...
And into the warren of offices and halls that is the working
White House.
He takes a right, passes the doors to the Oval
Office right next to his office, goes down a long, straight
hall, into...
The formal main building, the executive mansion.
He passes
the busts of Presidents past, turns left into an elevator.
The doors close.
The doors open.
Kenny strides out onto a DIFFERENT FLOOR,
the third.
He heads down the long, posh hall of the family
quarters.
Fine furnishings, art.
The living White House.
He approaches the double doors at the end of the hall guarded
by a cluster of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.
An agent opens one of
the doors.
KENNY
Morning, Floyd.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell.
Kenny enters the elegant bedroom.
The figure alone at a side
table by the window, drinks coffee, breakfast still spread
out before him, Washington Post obscuring his face.
KENNY
Top o' the morning, Mr. President.
The figure lowers the paper.
It is PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY.
He's wearing boxers and a
tank top.
Unshaven.
Bed-head.
Kenny O'Donnell, former ward-pol and long-time Kennedy man,
is his Chief of Staff...
THE PRESIDENT
Morning, Kenny.
You see this goddamn
Capehart stuff?
The President rattles the paper.
Kenny collapses in the
chair opposite the President, sprawls, comfortable.
KENNY
Bayh's going to lose, but it's good
groundwork for us for '64.
Kenny steals a piece of buttered toast off the President's
plate.
The President spares him a glance.
THE PRESIDENT
I was eating that.
KENNY
No you weren't.
THE PRESIDENT
(scanning the paper)
I was, you bastard.
Kenny takes a defiant bite.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
So what've we got today?
KENNY
Today, for your information, is Pulaski
Day.
We're going to Buffalo...
SMASH CUT TO:
SUPERIMPOSE: BUFFALO, NEW YORK
A luxury hotel crowded with LOCAL POLS: the Democratic
machine of Buffalo.
Beyond the open floor-to-ceiling
windows, a CROWD.
The Pulaski Day Parade, a glimpse of '69s
Americana.
High School bands blare Sousa.
The scene is
deafening, boisterous.
Pols trail Kenny as he crosses the
room: fast, tough, on-the-go.
POL #1
We're putting up Potowski next time.
Will you guys come out for him?
KENNY
Who else you got?
POL #2
There's Richardson.
Good kid.
KENNY
Got the touch?
POL #2
Yeah.
Still moldable, too.
KENNY
Everyone likes a good kid...
And like that, a congressional candidate is made...
Kenny
accelerates, leaving the Pols behind.
Suddenly, outside the
windows, the crowd swells forward with a collective ROAR.
CROWD
MR. PRESIDENT!
PRESIDENT KENNEDY!
In the back seat, Kenny stares out the window at the parade
goers.
The Secret Service Agents leave the Woman.
Disappointed, the Woman turns and vanishes into the crowd.
It's an eerie moment.
Something troubles Kenny, and he
glances up at the sky.
A premonition.
But it's a clear,
clear blue.
A day like this, all is right with the world...
SMASH CUT TO:
Six Interpreters huddle around IMAGES on a light table.
One
of them shoulders his way into the group and THUMPS a black
BINDER on the table.
There are grim nods of agreement.
The book is open to a PICTURE of an SS-4 BALLISTIC MISSILE.
A photo from Moscow Mayday parade.
An icon of the nuclear
age escorted like some devil-god to a holocaust...
END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE
Briefcase and coat in hand, Kenny enters his office - and
finds THREE MEN.
Standing there.
Thin-haired, bespectacled,
academic-looking MCGEORGE BUNDY, 43, the National Security
Advisor.
The two men in the background: PHOTO INTERPRETERS.
Kenny hangs up his coat, sees the Interpreters' large black
display cases.
And suddenly the world is slightly off
kilter.
KENNY
Hey, Mac.
You're up bright and early.
BUNDY
No, Ken.
I need to see him now...
Kenny emerges from the elevator with Bundy.
They head down
the long, posh 3rd floor hall, the Presidential Detail
guarding the doors at the end.
But the familiar route feels
strange, and lasting an eternity.
Kenny eyes the package
under Bundy's arm, its TOP SECRET stamp visible.
KENNY
Morning, Floyd.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell.
Mr. Bundy.
The Agent opens the door.
Bundy pauses, Kenny with him.
KENNY
What's it about?
BUNDY
Cuba.
Bundy is tense.
But Kenny relaxes.
KENNY
Just Cuba?
Okay, I got work to do, see
you guys downstairs.
Kenny's office is a raging beehive of activity.
Kenny works
the phone as ASSISTANTS come and go with files.
KENNY
(to phone, scary calm)
Listen to me, you worthless piece of
disloyal shit.
You will pull Daly's man
on the circuit.
You owe your goddamn
job to this administration.
(beat, listening)
There is a word you need to learn.
It
is the only word in politics.
Loyalty.
LOYALTY you motherfucking piece of shit!
As Kenny THROWS the phone down at the receiver, and the
PRIVATE DOOR to the Oval Office suddenly opens.
Kenny
glances up.
President Kennedy stands there in the doorway.
Kenny thinks he's reacting to the tirade.
KENNY (CONT'D)
What're you looking at?
This isn't the
blessed order of St. Mary the Meek.
Kenny stops.
KENNY (CONT'D)
Excuse us.
The Assistants leave, shutting the door after them.
Kenny
rises.
THE PRESIDENT
I think you should come in here.
Kenny starts for the door.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
Still think Cuba isn't important?
KENNY
Not as far as the election goes.
The President lets Kenny by into...
WE ENTER from a different angle than we usually enter in
movies: through the side door.
The President's ornate desk
sits on the right, windows looking out on the Rose Garden
behind it.
Kenny's gaze swivels to:
THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM where the Interpreters, their
crewcut chief, ARTHUR LUNDAHL, 50's, and Bundy stare at him.
They're surrounded by PRESENTATION BOARDS propped up around
the fireplace.
The President's rocking chair and sofas.
THE PRESIDENT
You used to look down a bomb sight for a
living, Ken.
What do you see?
In eerie silence, as all eyes follow him, Kenny makes his way
among the presentation boards with the U-2 imagery, stops in
front of the picture of the six canvas-covered objects.
It
unleashes a wave of memories.
KENNY
We hit a Nazi buzz bomb field in '45.
(beat, incredulous)
It looks like a rocket base...
He puts his hand out to touch the image, then turns and looks
to the President, knowing what they must be.
BUNDY
On Sunday morning, one of our U-2s took
these pictures.
The Soviets are putting
medium range ballistic missiles into
Cuba.
Shock.
Silence.
Kenny glances to the other men.
LUNDAHL
They appear to be the SS-4: range of a
thousand miles, three-megaton nuclear
warhead.
KENNY
Jesus Christ in Heaven...
A bank of WHITE HOUSE OPERATORS work the switchboard, fingers
flying, voices overlapping in a babble of:
VARIOUS OPERATORS
Please hold for the White House...Mr.
O'Donnell for Secretary McNamara...
White House Operator... please hold...
Kenny carries the phone with him as he paces hard from his
desk to his window.
KENNY
The principals are assembling in an
hour.
See you then.
Kenny hangs up.
The President enters.
A beat.
And in that
beat, there's a void.
The two men are off their emotional
stride, trying to grope their way out of shock.
THE PRESIDENT
Where's Bobby?
Kenny nods, acknowledging the feeling
KENNY
Should be here any minute.
THE PRESIDENT
Good.
And we glimpse the chemistry of these guys by Bobby's
absence.
It's like they're missing their third wheel.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
Good.
BOBBY (O.S.)
Where the hell are you?
The President and Kenny hear him out in the hall.
And the
tension goes out of them instantly.
THE PRESIDENT
In here!
They turn to the door as BOBBY KENNEDY, 37, the President's
younger brother/Attorney General, enters.
Bobby shuts the
door behind him, falls into Kenny's chair, and clearly
grappling with his own disbelief, is hushed.
BOBBY
Jesus Christ, guys.
What the hell's
Khruschev thinking?
THE PRESIDENT
Did you have any indication of this from
Georgi?
Any possible warning or sense
of motivation?
BOBBY
(shaking his head)
Complete snowjob.
And then we went out
and told the country they weren't
putting missiles into Cuba.
(beat)
By the way, you realize we just lost the
midterms.
KENNY
Who gives a shit about the midterms now?
The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons
ninety miles away from us.
BOBBY
You mean there's something more
important than votes?
Didn't think I'd
live to see the day, Ken.
The President paces away, grim.
KENNY
Jesus.
I feel like we've caught the Jap
carriers steaming for Pearl Harbor.
The President strides down the plush hallway, Bobby and Kenny
flanking him.
Unconsciously, all three men assume the same
gait: confident, powerful, no longer disoriented.
And before our eyes, the three men's game faces appear, and
they become the hard-ass leaders of the United States.
Secret Service Agents throw open the massive double doors to
the Cabinet Room.
And they enter.
The group of men at the long, ornate
Roosevelt-era table, rise as one.
GROUP
Good morning, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT
Good morning, gentlemen.
And the doors close on the eighteen men of EXCOM: The
Executive Committee of the National Security Council.
They
are the legendary "Best and Brightest."
The President makes his way down the line: shakes hands with
Secretary of State DEAN RUSK, 53, distinguished, with a soft,
Georgian accent, a distant reserve.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
Dean, good morning.
RUSK
Mr. President.
The President leans past him, grasps the hand of the
Secretary of Defense ROBERT MCNAMARA, 46, a gifted managerial
genius... the price of which is a cold, hard personality.
THE PRESIDENT
Bob.
Bet you had a late night.
MCNAMARA
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
OFF TO THE SIDE, Kenny greets Vice President LYNDON JOHNSON,
54, and ADLAI STEVENSON, 62, Representative to the U.N.,
intellectual, well-spoken.
KENNY
Lyndon.
Adlai.
The silver-haired war hero and politically savvy Chairman of
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, GENERAL MAXWELL TAYLOR, 50s,
shakes the President's hand.
THE PRESIDENT
Max.
GENERAL TAYLOR
McCone's been notified and is coming
back from the West coast.
Carter's
here, though.
He gestures to GENERAL MARSHALL CARTER, Deputy Chief of
Operations for the CIA.
Carter nods to the President.
THE CAMERA PANS OVER THE OTHERS.
DOUGLAS DILLON, ex-banker, Secretary of the Treasury.
ROSWELL GILPATRIC, studious Deputy Secretary of Defense.
PAUL NITZE, 55, the detail-driven facts man, Assistant
Secretary of Defense.
GEORGE BALL, 50s, Undersecretary of State.
Eloquent, a man
of conscience.
U. ALEXIS JOHNSON, Deputy Under Secretary of State.
EDWARD MARTIN, Assistant Secretary of State for Latin
America.
LLEWELLYN THOMPSON, laid back, rumpled Soviet Affairs
Advisor.
DON WILSON, Deputy Director of the USIA.
The President sits down at the center of the table, Rusk and
McNamara to either side, and the others resume their seats.
Bobby takes one of the over-stuffed chairs at the table.
Kenny finds one along the wall behind the President, under
the windows to the Rose Garden to TED SORENSEN, 30s, the
President's legal counsel and speech writer.
They greet each
other coolly.
KENNY
Ted.
SORENSEN
Kenny.
The room falls silent.
The President looks across the table
to GENERAL CARTER.
THE PRESIDENT
Okay.
Let's have it.
GENERAL CARTER
Arthur Lundahl heads our photographic
interpretation division at CIA.
I'll
let him and his boys take you through
what we've got.
Arthur?
Lundahl, standing at the end of the room with briefing
boards, steps forward with a pointer.
LUNDAHL
Gentlemen, as most of you now know a U-2
over Cuba on Sunday morning took a
series of disturbing photographs.
SWINGING THE POINTER AT A BOARD SMASH CUTS US TO:
Lundahl raps his second board: a map of the United States,
Cuba visible in the lower corner.
An ARC is drawn clearly
across the U.S., encompassing the entire Southeast.
LUNDAHL
IRONBARK reports the SS-4 can deliver a
3-megaton nuclear weapon 1000 miles.
So
far we have identified 32 missiles
served by around 3400 men, undoubtedly
all Soviet personnel.
Our cities and
military installations in the Southeast,
as far north as Washington, are in range
of these weapons, and in the event of a
launch, would only have five minutes of
warning.
GENERAL CARTER
Five minutes, gentlemen.
Five minutes.
GENERAL TAYLOR
In those five minutes they could kill 80
million Americans and destroy a
significant number of our bomber bases,
degrading our retaliatory options.
The
Joint Chiefs' consensus is that this is
a massively destabilizing move,
upsetting the nuclear balance.
The President stares at Lundahl, and beating out each word.
THE PRESIDENT
Arthur.
Are. You. Sure?
Lundahl looks around the room.
Everyone is hanging.
LUNDAHL
Yes, Mr. President.
These are nuclear
missiles.
The men come to grips with their own fears, own anger.
BOBBY
How long until they're operational?
LUNDAHL
General Taylor can answer that question
better than I can.
General Taylor drops a memo on the table WHICH BECOMES:
Taylor sees the grim looks all around.
GENERAL TAYLOR
I have to stress that there may be more
missiles that we don't know about.
We
need more U-2 coverage.
Kenny lets out his breath.
He catches Bobby's eye.
This is
unbelievable.
THE PRESIDENT
Is there any indication - anything at
all - that suggests they intend to use
these missiles in some sort of first
strike?
GENERAL CARTER
Not at present, sir.
But I think the
prudent answer is we don't know.
THE PRESIDENT
Do we have any sort of intelligence from
CIA on what Khruschev is thinking?
GENERAL CARTER
No, Mr. President.
We don't.
We just
don't know what's happening inside the
Kremlin at that level.
BOBBY
They lied to us.
Two weeks ago Dobrynin
told me to my face Khurschev had no
intention of putting missiles into Cuba.
They said themselves, this is our
backyard.
There's angry agreement.
The President cuts it off.
THE PRESIDENT
Gentlemen, I want first reactions.
Assuming for a moment Khruschev has not
gone off the deep end and intends to
start World War Three, what are we
looking at?
Rusk glances to his team at the end of the table.
Ball,
Johnson, Martin, Thompson and Stevenson.
RUSK
Mr. President, I believe my team is in
agreement.
If we permit the
introduction of nuclear missiles to a
Soviet satellite nation in our
hemisphere, the diplomatic consequences
will be too terrible to contemplate.
The Russians are trying to show the
world they can do whatever they want,
wherever they want, and we're powerless
to stop them.
If they succeed...
BOBBY
It will be Munich all over again.
RUSK
Appeasement only makes the aggressor
more aggressive.
Confidence in our
security commitments around the world
will falter, allies will become unsure
in the face of Soviet pressure, and the
Soviets will be emboldened to push us
even harder.
We must remove the
missiles one way or another.
It seems
to me the options are either to build up
the crisis 'til they give in, or we hit
them.
An air strike.
There's silence at the table.
Some nods.
Understanding.
THE PRESIDENT
Bob?
MCNAMARA
We've worked up several military
scenarios.
Before I ask General Taylor
to lead us through the various options,
I'd like for us to adopt a rule.
If we are going to strike, we must agree
now that we will do it before the
missiles become operational.
Because
once they are, I don't think we can
guarantee getting them all before at
least some are launched.
And there it is.
The clock is running.
BUNDY
Sir.
We need to consider... if we
decide to act, there's a good chance
we'll end up in a general war.
The room falls silent.
The President leans back in his
chair, studying the circle of men around the table, weighing
them.
Kenny and the others watch him in silence.
A long, dramatic
pause.
A course that will change history is about to be
chosen.
The President leans forward, folds his hands on the
table.
Fated.
Grave.
THE PRESIDENT
It's clear we cannot permit Soviet
nuclear missiles in Cuba.
We must get
those missiles out.
Kenny moves hard and fast through the twisting warren of
hallways and tiny offices which is the West Wing.
Suddenly,
Scotty Reston pops out of a doorway behind Kenny.
RESTON
Hey, Kenny!
Who died?
Kenny glances over his shoulder at Scotty who points to a
window.
A beat, then Kenny returns to look out the window.
Outside, the West Wing Drive is FILLED WITH LIMOUSINES.
A flash of dismay, but Kenny covers fast.
KENNY
Way it's going, the Democratic Party.
DNC strategy session.
If you can call
it that.
Scotty chuckles.
Kenny moves off, leading him away.
Kenny's
assistant runs up behind him, holding out a slip of paper.
ASSISTANT
Sir?
Kenny tries to look him away.
RESTON
It's Tuesday.
You said to call.
When
do I get my 45 minutes?
KENNY
Tell you what.
We're in Connecticut
tomorrow for Ribicoff.
I'll get you up
front with him during the flight.
RESTON
Deal.
ASSISTANT
Sir.
Kenny turns, harsh
KENNY
What is it?
The Assistant eyes Scotty, holds his tongue.
Kenny takes the
slips.
ASSISTANT
The number you asked for.
KENNY
I ask for a lot of 'em.
Whose is it?
ASSISTANT
Dean Acheson's, sir.
That shuts Kenny up.
Reston eyes the slip, then looks to
Kenny's face.
And he knows something isn't right here.
KENNY
Gotta go, Scotty.
See you tomorrow.
A car jolts to a stop.
The CAMERA PANS up over the sagging
suspension, the government plates, the hood ornament
revealing half of EXCOM inside.
Kenny stands nearby waiting
for them.
The doors open, and out they pile like a bunch of clowns:
Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Ball, Martin, Dioptric, Sorensen,
Stevenson, and Nitze.
They're sitting in each others' laps,
banging their heads on the roof, joking, but tense.
BOBBY
Screw secrecy.
You try having that fat
ass sit on your lap all the way from
Foggy Bottom.
MCNAMARA
You were excited.
I say no more.
The gang falls in behind Kenny, trails him out of the garage.
A steel door unlocks, swings open, and Kenny marches at the
head of the wedge of men into a long tunnel.
It's the
infamous old passage from the Treasury to the White House.
Kenny and Bobby get a little ahead of the others.
BOBBY
Everybody agrees the diplomatic route is
out.
It's too slow, and they'll have
the missiles finished.
Kenny looks at him.
Then there's only one alternative.
The
CAMERA wipes through the ceiling to:
GENERAL WALTER 'CAM' SWEENEY, head of Tactical Air Command,
stands at the head of the table with a presentation board.
The men of EXCOM gather around Sweeney in their rumpled
shirts, nursing coffee and cigarettes.
GENERAL SWEENEY
We have 850 planes assembling at
Homestead, Eglin, Opa Locka, MacDill,
Patrick, Pensacola and Key West.
SMASH CUT TO:
Other EXCOM members draw near the board, its order of battle,
strike maps.
They're grim, but fascinated.
Empowering.
Intoxicating.
Sexy.
Kenny sees it in the faces, even the
President's.
Adlai does too, is upset.
ADLAI
I still think there are diplomatic
approaches we haven't considered yet.
Kenny looks at Adlai.
The others around the room,
embarrassed, don't respond.
The group has moved on and
Stevenson hasn't.
GENERAL TAYLOR
We have high confidence in the expanded
air strike option.
(beat)
The problem, Mr. President, is that it's
a short-term solution.
Khruschev can
send more missiles next month.
The
Chiefs and I believe we should follow up
the air strikes with the full version of
OPLAN 316.
THE PRESIDENT
An invasion...
GENERAL TAYLOR
Yes, sir.
We can be sure we get all the
missiles, and we remove Castro so this
can never happen again.
Kenny looks around the room at the men, the murmurs of
general agreement, senses the consensus building and is
agitated.
THE PRESIDENT
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
GENERAL TAYLOR
Yes, sir.
Our best option is to
commence the strikes before the missiles
are operational.
The invasion happens
eight days later.
The President leans back in his chair, turns to the man at
the far end of the table: DEAN ACHESON, 60s, former Secretary
of State.
He sits silent, like some revered oracle, the
architect of the American Cold War strategy of containment.
THE PRESIDENT
Dean.
What do you think?
Acheson arches an eyebrow, and when he speaks, his voice
resonates throughout the room, powerful, smooth, hypnotic.
ACHESON
Mr. President, you have rightly
dismissed the diplomatic option.
The
Soviet will only tie you down in
negotiation, and leave us short of our
goal, the removal of the missiles.
Negotiating will do nothing more than
give them time to make the missiles
operational, complicating the necessary
military task we have at hand.
Everyone in the room listens to him with rapt attention, his
presence overshadowing the room, oracular:
ACHESON (CONT'D)
For the last fifteen years, I have
fought here at this table along side
your predecessors in the struggle
against the Soviet.
Gentlemen, I do not
wish to seem melodramatic, but I do wish
to impress upon you one observation with
all conceivable sincerity.
A lesson I
have learned with bitter tears and great
sacrifice.
(beat)
The Soviet understands only one
language: action.
It respects only one
word: force.
Kenny stares at the old man.
Acheson's gaze finds his
through the cigarette smoke.
Acheson's eyes travel to the
President.
ACHESON (CONT'D)
I concur with General Taylor.
I
recommend, sir, air strikes followed by
invasion, perhaps preceded by an
ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if
military necessity permits.
Taylor nods, vindicated.
The others murmur their approval.
Bobby, at the table in front of Kenny and to his left, trades
a dire look with Kenny.
This is happening too fast.
Bobby
holds his head, looks about at the others, deeply distressed.
The President sinks back in his chair, staring at Acheson.
THE PRESIDENT
Then it appears we have three options.
Number one.
A surgical air strike
against the missiles themselves.
Two, a
larger air strike against their air
defenses along with the missiles.
Kenny eyes Bobby.
Bobby is writing something.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
And three, invasion.
Bobby looks over his shoulder at Kenny, and REACHES BACK to
him with a folded NOTE.
Kenny takes it, opens it.
It reads NOW I KNOW WHO TOJO FELT PLANNING PEARL HARBOR.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
We're certainly going to do number one;
we're going to take out these missiles,
so it seems to me we don't have to wait
very long.
We ought to at least be
making those preparations.
Kenny gives Bobby a curt nod.
Bobby tilts his head at the
President: pass the note on to him.
Kenny rises, slips the
note in front of the President.
The President unfolds the note, and we HOLD ON IT and his
reaction as in the b.g., out of focus, Taylor speaks:
GENERAL TAYLOR
Yes, sir, we're preparing to implement
all three options, though I must stress
again, sir, there are risks to the
strikes without the follow-on invasion.
Bundy clears his throat.
Speaks from somewhere down the
table.
BUNDY
You want to be clear, Mr. President,
that we have definitely decided against
a political track.
The President folds the note away, glances at Bobby.
A beat,
the President looks from Bobby to Acheson.
THE PRESIDENT
Dean, how does this play out?
ACHESON
Your first step, sir, will be to demand
that the Soviet withdraw the missiles
within 12 to 24 hours.
They will
refuse.
When they do, you will order
the strikes, followed by the invasion.
They will resist, but will be overrun.
They will retaliate against a target
somewhere else in the world, most likely
Berlin.
We will honor our treaty
commitments and resist them there,
defeating them per our plans.
THE PRESIDENT
Those plans call for the use of nuclear
weapons.
(beat)
And what is the next step?
Acheson sits back in his chair, smooths his moustache.
A
dramatic beat, and then his ominous pronouncement rings out:
ACHESON
Hopefully cooler heads will prevail
before we reach the next step.
A chill runs down Kenny's spine.
He looks in shock to the
President.
The President remains calm.
But in place of the
fated look the President has had, there's a hesitation.
Acheson strides down the hall, Taylor, Sweeney, Carter and
Bundy swept along behind him.
Bundy is on the defensive, the
others grim.
GENERAL TAYLOR
If McNamara'd get off the fence...
BUNDY
We have time.
GENERAL CARTER
Goddamn it, it's obvious.
It's the only
option.
That asshole, Stevenson.
We
can't let this drag out or we lose our
shot.
BUNDY
Bombing them...
ACHESON
Remember that the Kennedys' father was
one of the architects of Munich.
The
General is right.
There is only one
responsible choice here.
Bundy just nods.
Taylor grabs a door ahead for Acheson.
ACHESON (CONT'D)
Let's pray appeasement doesn't run in
families.
I fear weakness does.
And the men head into a stairwell going down.
Grimacing in pain.
He opens a pill bottle, takes two pills
out.
He takes a whiskey in a shot glass from Kenny.
RESUME
Kenny finishes pouring him and Bobby a couple of more shots,
discreetly turning a blind eye to the President's pain.
The President returns from his desk, shirt untucked,
disheveled, back stiff.
He eases into his rocking chair.
Bobby lies sprawled on the couch.
Kenny sits down.
They all
look at each other.
A beat, something like shock.
KENNY
Jesus Christ Almighty...
They burst out laughing.
An absurd, tension draining moment.
They shoot their drinks, Kenny refills.
KENNY (CONT'D)
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in
cooler heads prevailing.
THE PRESIDENT
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable.
And
he has more experience than anyone.
KENNY
There is no expert on this subject, no
wise old man.
The President stares Kenny in the face, understanding.
THE PRESIDENT
The thing is, Acheson's right.
Talk
alone won't accomplish anything.
Kenny considers the President, his face straight as he says:
KENNY
Then let's bomb the shit out of them.
Everyone wants to, even you, even me.
(there's a point)
It sure would feel good.
The President sees what Kenny's saying: it'd be an emotional
response, not necessarily the intelligent one.
BOBBY
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but
a sneak attack is just wrong.
KENNY
He's right.
And things are happening
too fast.
It smells like the Bay of
Pigs all over again.
Bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee
table.
BOBBY
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't
hard enough, we gotta worry about our
own house.
THE PRESIDENT
Tonight, listening to Taylor and
Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles
telling me all I had to do was sign on
the dotted line.
The invasion would
succeed.
Castro would be gone.
Just
like that.
Easy.
The President is rendered mute by a wave of pain.
Kenny and
Bobby aver their eyes.
When it passes, the President is
hushed, grave.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
There's something...immoral about
abandoning your own judgement.
Kenny nods, moved.
The President reaches out for the
reconnaissance photos Bobby's flipping through.
Bobby hands
them to him.
The President looks them over.
And when he
speaks, there's humility.
And resolve.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
We can't let things get ahead of
themselves.
We've got to control what
happens.
We're going to do what we have to make
this come out right.
EXCOM is our first
weapon.
(beat)
We'll resort to others as we need 'em.
SUPER: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17TH.
DAY 2
A LONG SHOT of an ENORMOUS CROWD thronging a bunting-trimmed
platform.
The President, barely recognizable at the
distance, and a cluster of political VIPS wave from it,
smiling.
Kenny steps INTO FRAME, back here at the fringes of the
crowd.
THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
Doesn't anybody in Connecticut have to
work today?
The crowd goes nuts.
Kenny paces, checks his watch,
impatient to be done with the necessary diversion.
Kenny
gazes off to his right and spots Scotty Reston, along with
half the White House press corps suckered along.
Scotty
catches Kenny's look.
Kenny turns away, but Scotty comes weaving over.
The
President continues on, but all we hear is Scotty and Kenny.
RESTON
Kenny!
What happened?
They didn't let
me up front, said the President was on
the phone the whole time.
KENNY
He was.
RESTON
Yeah?
Who was he talking to?
Acheson?
Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering
what's going on.
What's Acheson doing
in town?
And don't give me some
bullshit about DNC think tanks.
Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
KENNY
Why don't you ask him yourself?
You can
have him on the way home.
RESTON
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to
me.
You can influence how this thing
unfolds.
But Kenny stands there, mute.
Reston just shakes his head,
knowing for sure something's up.
He turns and heads back for
the press corps.
EXCOM meets in George Ball's small conference room at the
State Department.
Bobby, in shirtsleeves, paces at the head
of the table, very, very alone.
All eyes are on him.
BOBBY
No.
No.
No.
There is more than one
option here.
If one isn't occurring to
us, it's because we haven't thought hard
enough.
McNamara squirms.
The others react in frustration.
CIA
chief JOHN MCCONE, sharp, tough, conservative, is harsh.
MCCONE
Sometimes there is only one right
choice, and you thank God when it's
clear.
BOBBY
You're talking about a sneak attack!
How'll that make us look?
Big country
blasting a little one into the stone
age.
We'll be real favorites around the
world.
ACHESON
Bobby, that's naive.
This is the real
world, you know that better than
anybody.
Your argument is ridiculous.
MCCONE
You weren't so ethically particular when
we were talking about options for
removing Castro over at CIA.
And there's nothing Bobby can say to that.
He props himself
up on the table, stares at it as if there's an answer in its
shiny surface somewhere.
There is only the reflection of his
own face.
BOBBY
I can't let my brother go down in
History like a villain, like a Tojo,
ordering another Pearl Harbor.
McCone, Acheson, and Taylor share a look.
The last
resistance to airstrikes is crumbling.
Finally, Bobby looks
up at McNamara.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Bob.
If we go ahead with these air
strikes...
(beat)
There's got to be something else.
Give
it to me.
I don't care how crazy,
inadequate or stupid it sounds.
(beat, pleading)
Give it to me.
McNamara suffers under the gaze of everyone at the table,
weighing the situation out.
And finally he ventures.
MCNAMARA
Six months ago we gamed out a scenario.
It's slow.
It doesn't get rid of the
missiles.
There are a lot of drawbacks.
(beat)
The scenario was for a blockade of Cuba.
SUPER: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18TH.
DAY 3
Kenny enters the office from his side door in the middle of a
debate.
Military uniforms dominate the room: General Taylor,
General Sweeney, and a host of briefing officers.
GENERAL TAYLOR
The situation is worse than we thought.
We count 40 missiles now, longer range
IRBMs.
They can hit every city in the
continental U.S.
The President stares out the window at the Rose Garden, his
back to Air Force Chief of Staff GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY, 60.
Beetle-browed, arrogant, the archetypal Cold War general.
Yet there is something about him, his intelligence perhaps,
that suggests he's playing a role he knows and believes in.
The only other civilians in the room are Bobby, Bundy and
McNamara.
The pressure from the military is almost physical.
LEMAY
Mr. President, as of this moment my
planes are ready to carry out the air
strikes.
All you have to do is give me
the word, sir, and my boys will get
those Red bastards.
The President continues staring out the window.
Kenny eases
over to the desk, leans on it, arms folded, interposing
himself between the President and the soldiers.
Bobby joins
him, side-by-side.
THE PRESIDENT
How long until the army is ready?
GENERAL TAYLOR
We've just begun the mobilization under
cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir.
We're looking at another week and a
half, Mr. President.
LEMAY
But you can begin the strikes, now.
The
plans call for an eight-day air
campaign.
It'd light a fire under the
army's ass to get in place.
That makes the President turn around, stare at LeMay.
THE PRESIDENT
General LeMay, do you truly believe
that's our best course of action?
LEMAY
Mr. President, I believe it is the only
course of action.
American is in
danger.
Those missiles are a threat to
our bomber bases and the safety of our
nuclear deterrent.
Without our
deterrent, there's nothing to keep the
enemy from choosing general nuclear war.
It's our duty, our responsibility to the
American people to take out those
missiles and return stability to the
strategic situation.
The Big Red Dog is
digging in our back yard, and we're
justified in shooting him.
Taylor steps in softly, smoothly: good cop to LeMay's bad.
GENERAL TAYLOR
Sir, we have a rapidly closing window of
opportunity where we can prevent those
missiles from ever becoming operational.
The other options...
He spares a look at McNamara, who watches the fireworks, arms
folded, serious.
GENERAL TAYLOR (CONT'D)
...do not guarantee the end result we
can guarantee.
However, the more time
that goes by, the less reliable the
choice we can offer you becomes.
The President, partially defused, looks from Taylor to
McNamara.
LeMay steps forward, softer now, sincere.
LEMAY
Mr. President, the motto I chose for SAC
is 'Peace is our Profession.'
God
forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear
exchange.
But if launched, those
missiles in Cuba would kill a lot of
Americans.
That's why I'm being such a
pain in the ass about destroying them.
Destroying them immediately.
Hell, even
Mac agrees.
Bundy is uncomfortable.
Everyone turns to him.
He nods.
Kenny realizes he's been co-opted by the military.
McNamara
does too, lets out a deep breath.
The President eyes Bundy,
then paces out from behind his desk, walks up to LeMay.
THE PRESIDENT
General, what will the Soviets do when
we attack?
LEMAY
Nothing.
Kenny, Bobby and the President look at each other, unable to
believe what they just heard.
THE PRESIDENT
Nothing?
LEMAY
Nothing.
Because the only alternative
open to them is one they can't choose.
His pronouncement hangs there in the air: ominous, dangerous.
THE PRESIDENT
Those aren't just missiles we'll be
destroying.
We kill Soviet soldiers,
and they will respond.
How would we
respond if they killed ours?
No, they
will do something, General, I promise
you that.
And I believe it'll be
Berlin.
LeMay walk out of the Oval Office with Taylor, Carter and
their staffers.
LEMAY
Those goddamn Kennedys are going to
destroy this country if we don't do
something about this.
There are dark looks on the faces of the other officers.
They agree.
As the meeting next door disperses, the President rummages
through Kenny's jacket which hangs on Kenny's chair.
Kenny,
bemused, holds out the package of cigarettes the President is
looking for.
KENNY
I was hoping LeMay pushed you.
I
wouldn't mind going a few rounds with
him.
The President glances up, takes the proffered smokes.
THE PRESIDENT
We knew it was coming.
I tell you,
Kenny, these brass hats have one big
advantage.
We do what they want us to,
none of us will be alive to tell 'em
they were wrong.
Bobby, Rusk and Sorensen enter from the hall.
SORENSEN
Mr. President, Gromyko should be on his
way by now.
RUSK
We need to go over what you're going to
say.
BOBBY
There's still no sign they know that we
know about the missiles.
Been a lot of
cloud cover; probably think we aren't
getting any good product.
THE PRESIDENT
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we
can.
But I sure as hell am going to
test him.
Kenny comes out of the bathroom, and is buttonholed by the
crewcut, bullet-headed Press Secretary, PIERRE SALINGER, in
the crowded, busy hallway.
SALINGER
Kenny, I'm getting funny questions from
the guys in the press office.
As Press
Secretary, I need to know.
What's going
on?
Kenny wheels back into his office.
It's filled with people.
But he bends confidentially to Pierre's ear.
KENNY
They're planning to shave you bald next
time you fall asleep on the bus.
(off Pierre's get-serious look)
Sorry, Pierre, Gromyko just arrived.
The Press Corps throngs Kenny's tiny office, pushing and
shoving for a vantage at the side door to the Oval Office,
waiting for the Gromyko photo-op.
Kenny stands shoulder-to
shoulder with Reston and Sorensen near the door.
RESTON
Are they going to discuss the military
exercises going on in Florida?
Kenny doesn't even blink, but Sorensen does a poorer job at
hiding his reaction.
KENNY
Come on, Scotty.
This meeting's been on
the books for months.
It's just a
friendly talk on U.S.-Soviet relations.
Fortunately, the conversation is cut short as a dozen
FLASHBULBS suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the
reporters crush in on the Oval Office, and Reston is swept
forward.
KENNY'S POV:
over the reporters.
The President, unsmiling, enters the
room beside Soviet Foreign Minister, ANDREI GROMYKO.
Gromyko
pauses for the photos: grim, dark haired, saturnine.
RESUME
Kenny reacts.
At last, the face of the enemy.
The CAMERA picks up the darkened windows: the meeting has
gone long.
The CAMERA MOVES PAST Kenny and Sorensen standing
in the doorway to Kenny's office, FINDS the President in his
chair across from Gromyko on the sofa.
Rusk, Ambassador
ANATOLY DOBRINYN, and two INTERPRETERS around them.
THE PRESIDENT
So that there should be no
misunderstanding, the position of the
United States, which has been made clear
by the Attorney General to Ambassador
Dobrynin here, I shall read a sentence
from my own statement to the press dated
September 13th.
(beat, reading)
Should missiles or offensive weapons be
placed in Cuba, it would present the
gravest threat to U.S. national
security.
The President stares at Gromyko as the translator finishes
translating.
Gromyko sits there, enigmatic, cold,
unreadable.
The translator finishes, and Gromyko stops him
with a gesture so he can answer in his own accented English.
GROMYKO
Mr. President, this will never be done.
You need not be concerned.
The President hides his fury masterfully, and gazing over his
glasses, asks:
THE PRESIDENT
So I do not misunderstand you: there are
no offensive weapons in Cuba.
A beat.
And Gromyko's response is flat, sure, steady:
GROMYKO
No, Mr. President.
We have sent
defensive weapons only to Cuba.
Kenny's blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of
Gromyko's head.
His gaze swings to the PRESIDENT'S DESK.
BENEATH THE DESK sit the BRIEFING BOARDS with the evidence.
Kenny emerges from his office.
The Soviet delegation
disappears down the hallway with Rusk.
Kenny turns as Bobby,
haggard, comes up from the other direction.
Bobby gestures to the vanishing delegation, now being
HARANGUED OC by the press.
BOBBY
What happened?
The President comes out of the next door down the hall, the
Oval Office.
He turns and sees Kenny and Bobby.
He's livid.
THE PRESIDENT
Lying bastard.
Lied to my face.
BOBBY
We're split down the middle.
If I held
a vote I think airstrike would beat
blockade by a vote or two.
THE PRESIDENT
I want a consensus, Bobby.
Consensus.
Either air strike or blockade.
Something everyone'll stand by even if
they don't like it.
I need it by
Saturday.
Make it happen.
BOBBY
What if I can't?
KENNY
We go into this split, the Russians will
know it.
And they'll use it against us.
The prospect disturbs the three men.
THE PRESIDENT
Have you cancelled Chicago and the rest
of the weekend yet?
KENNY
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll
know there's something going on.
THE PRESIDENT
I don't care.
Cancel it.
KENNY
No way.
The President spins on him, unsure he heard correctly.
KENNY (CONT'D)
I'm not calling and cancelling on Daly.
You call and cancel on Daly.
THE PRESIDENT
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
KENNY
Damn right I'm scared.
The President pauses, looks at Bobby.
Bobby shakes his head:
don't look at me.
THE PRESIDENT
Well, I'm not.
BOBBY
Then you'll call, right?
SUPER: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19TH.
DAY 4
THEN SUPER: CHICAGO
Kenny threads his way through the host of SECRET SERVICE
AGENTS and ADVANCE MAN cramming the hallway on the floor of
the hotel they've taken over.
From one of the rooms emerges
Salinger.
SALINGER
Kenny, all right.
What's going on here?
There's rumors going around an exercise
in the southeast is related to Cuba.
I'm the Press Secretary.
I can't do my
job if I don't know what's going on.
So
what's going on?
KENNY
What are you telling them?
SALINGER
The truth: I don't know.
KENNY
(deadly serious)
Tell 'em you've looked into it, and all
it is is an exercise.
And Pierre --
(beat, loaded)
The President may have a cold tomorrow.
Kenny stares at him, and the light dawns on Pierre.
Something big is going on and he's been cut out of it.
He
stalks off.
SALINGER
Damn it, Kenny.
Goddamn it!
A big 100-dollar-a-plate dinner is in full swing to a dinner
band's tunes.
The President and Chicago MAYOR RICHARD DALY
make the rounds among the fund raising CROWD.
Kenny follows
them at a respectful distance, greeting old cronies.
Suddenly a MESSENGER hustles over to Kenny, hands him a note.
Kenny makes eye contact with the President, nods and leaves.
Kenny waits at the elevator.
Scotty saunters up behind him.
He sizes Kenny up, clears his throat.
Kenny turns around.
RESTON
There are major rail disruptions in the
South, two airborne divisions are on
alert.
That exercise is an invasion.
KENNY
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for
the State of Mississippi.
RESTON
This is about Cuba.
Kenny freezes, then explodes.
KENNY
Cuba?
You're fucking crazy.
We are not
invading Cuba.
Nobody gives a rat's ass
about Cuba.
Not now, not ever.
If you print something like that, all
you're going to do is inflame the
situation.
Nobody talks to assholes who
inflame situations.
Assholes like that
can find themselves cut out of the loop.
Reston is taken aback.
Stung silence for a beat.
Kenny's
response is far louder than any "yes."
Now Kenny realizes
it.
RESTON
You've never threatened me before.
And Kenny looks away, upset, but when he turns back to
Reston, all that's there is his poker face.
The elevator
arrives.
RESTON (CONT'D)
All right.
I'm not going to print
anything until I have another source.
But I promise you, I'll get one.
Kenny boards the elevator.
The doors shut on Scotty.
Kenny closes his eyes, sags against the wall, hating himself.
Kenny enters his hotel room.
An Assistant waits with the
phone, hands it straight to Kenny.
KENNY
(to Assistant)
Tell Pierre I need to talk to him.
(to phone)
Bobby?
EXCOM files past Bobby out of George Ball's conference room.
BOBBY
Bring him back.
The White House Oval ROOM: opulent, filled with priceless art
and furniture, but cramped.
EXCOM members crowd around the
center coffee table and the President.
Kenny stands behind
him with Bobby.
Rusk rises from his seat, formal.
RUSK
Mr. President, our deliberations have
led us to the conclusion that, for the
moment, a blockade of offensive weapons
to Cuba is our best option.
But we'll
still need a strong showing of support
from the Organization of American States
to give us an umbrella of legitimacy.
At long last... Kenny looks at Bobby, relieved.
They've
bought time to find a settlement.
Bobby smiles a small
smile: what were you so worried about?
MCNAMARA
A blockade is technically an act of war,
therefore we recommend calling the
action a quarantine.
McNamara folder in hand, opens it, SMASH CUTTING US TO:
The President.
He listens, looks over the briefing papers as
McNamara continues.
Everyone watches the President.
MCNAMARA
A quarantine prevents more missiles from
reaching Cuba, but it doesn't remove the
ones already there.
It gives the
Soviets a chance to pull back without
war.
If they refuse to remove the
missiles before they're operational, we
retain the option to strike or invade.
BOBBY
We believe that a surprise attack would
be counter to what the United States
stands for.
We believe that an attack
leaves us no room for maneuver, and the
inevitable Soviet response will force us
into a war we do not want.
A war that,
this time, will really end all war.
MCCONE
Mr. President, there are still those of
us who believe we should proceed with
the strikes.
With the blockade, we lose
strategic surprise and we run the risk
of a first strike if the Soviets decide
they have to use the missiles or lose
them.
The President gazes from one expectant face to another.
But
he himself remains unreadable.
THE PRESIDENT
Quarantine or air strike.
Adlai clears his throat.
Everyone looks over at him.
He
stares down at his clasped hands for a beat.
He's anguished
about what he's going to say.
ADLAI
There is a third option.
With either
course we undertake the risk of nuclear
war.
It seems to me maybe one of us in
here should be a coward.
He smiles weakly, but gets no response from anyone.
ADLAI (CONT'D)
So I guess I'll be.
Our third choice is
to cut a deal.
We trade Guantanamo and
our missiles in Turkey, get them to pull
their missiles out.
We employ a back
channel, attribute the idea to U Thant.
U Thant then raises it at the U.N.
Adlai looks for support around the room, but meets only stony
gazes.
From McCone and General Taylor, contempt.
Dead
silence for a long, long beat.
Kenny's heart goes out to Stevenson as he watches the man
commit political suicide.
Even Sorensen, standing behind
him, unconsciously moves away.
At last the President speaks.
THE PRESIDENT
I don't think that's possible, Adlai.
(beat, to the room)
I will be asking the networks for air
time Monday night.
I have not yet made
my final decision.
We will announce our
course of action then.
I want to thank
you all for your advice, gentlemen.
Kenny, shut in the bedroom, paces on the phone.
KENNY
We're not going to make it to Monday.
I'll try to lean on Reston, but you're
going to have to call Orville Dryfoos.
This is the sort of decision the
publisher makes himself.
New York Times publisher ORVILLE DRYFOOS sits at his kitchen
table in his underwear, still half-asleep, phone to his ear.
DRYFOOS
Yes, sir, I understand.
But we held on
Bay of Pigs and it was the biggest
mistake of my life.
What makes this any
different?
The President, on the phone, stops pacing by his bedside
table and exhales.
THE PRESIDENT
I'm asking you to hold the story until I
can present our course of action on
Monday night.
DRYFOOS
All right.
But I need a reason to give
my boys.
They're going to be screaming
for my head on a plate.
THE PRESIDENT
Orville.
I want you to tell them this:
they'll be saving lives.
Maybe even
including their own.
At that, Dryfoos sits up.
Serious.
All resistance gone.
DRYFOOS
Yes, Mr. President.
SUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 21ST.
DAY 6
AVE MARIA soars over the communion meditation at a crowded
Sunday mass.
Kenny, in a pew, glances off to his left.
The President sits nearby, head bowed.
But Kenny knows he's
not thinking about the mass.
And when the President at last
lifts his head, Kenny sees the calm poise.
The President has made up his mind...
Bobby barges into Kenny's office.
Kenny, knowing his unique
entry, doesn't bother to look up.
KENNY
Acheson called, DeGaulle's with us;
haven't heard from anyone else yet.
Kenny finally looks up.
Bobby's grim.
And an icicle forms
in Kenny's gut as Bobby relays.
BOBBY
He wants to talk to LeMay again.
Kenny, Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Bundy and half of EXCOM stand
to the side of the room.
General Sweeney and LeMay stand in
front of the President's desk.
The President, bowed in the window, is care-worn, a thousand
years old.
The shadow, the composition of the SHOT tells us
all.
It's down to what's in the heart of one man.
Kenny is
deeply moved at his friend's Gethsemane.
THE PRESIDENT
Cam, can you guarantee me you'll get all
the missiles?
Sweeney glances at LeMay.
LeMay's stern, frozen look wills
him to say, very simply, "yes."
But then the President turns around, looks Sweeney in the
eye.
It would make Machiavelli himself tell the truth.
GENERAL SWEENEY
Sir, I can guarantee we'll get all the
missiles we know about.
The President holds Sweeney in his gaze.
Thank you.
LEMAY
Mr. President, we can get better than
ninety percent of them.
The President doesn't respond to LeMay's last-ditch appeal.
Ninety-percent isn't good enough with nuclear weapons.
He
moves to his desk, signs a paper, hands it to General
Sweeney.
THE PRESIDENT
As of seven o'clock Monday night, all
United States armed forces world wide
will stand up to DEFCON 3.
-- into the depths of a missile silo.
The CAMERA speeds down
the side of the Titan missile, through CLOUDS of steaming
liquid hydrogen, past FUELING HOSES which clamp one by one to
the rocket's side, past GANTRY ARMS pulling away.
The CAMERA
hurtles all the way to the bottom, SMASHING THROUGH THE FLOOR
TO:
The doors to the Cabinet room.
A beat.
Then they SWING
WIDE.
The President emerges, livid fury on his face, leaving
chaos behind: the Congressional briefing.
Kenny comes out a
beat later, catches up with him.
KENNY
You'd worry that something was wrong if
Congress offered you unconditional
support.
THE PRESIDENT
They want this fucking job, they can
have it.
It's no great joy to me.
The President exhales, getting control.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
The elected representatives of the
people have spoken...
(beat; determined)
Now let's tell the people...
Kenny stands there in the doorway, arms folded.
As we PULL
AWAY FROM HIM, we REVEAL the three NETWORK T.V. CAMERAS
staring straight at us.
Their red lights go on as one, and
we swing around REVERSING TO:
The President at his desk: telegenic, powerful.
THE PRESIDENT
Good evening, my fellow citizens.
This
Government, as promised, has maintained
the closest surveillance of the Soviet
military build-up on the island of
Cuba...
A beat.
And the President looks up from his notes.
THE PRESIDENT
And third: it shall be the policy of
this nation to regard any nuclear
missile launched from Cuba against any
nation in the Western Hemisphere as an
attack by the Soviet Union on the United
States, requiring a full retaliatory
response upon the Soviet Union...
The chilling words hang there in the air.
BLEEDING IN: the
rising and falling WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP which becomes --
SUPER: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 23RD.
DAY 8
Kenny, stripped to the waist, Sorensen and Bundy shave in
nearby sinks.
Bobby barges in.
BOBBY
We're getting the Soviet response.
Specks of shaving cream still on his face, Kenny paces, reads
the inky carbon as Bobby, Bundy and Sorensen read copies.
KENNY
This is all rhetoric.
(realizing)
They don't know how to respond yet.
Kenny looks up.
The President enters from the Oval Office.
THE PRESIDENT
So now you're Khurschev.
What do you
do?
Kenny, arms folded, stands behind the President, the rest of
EXCOM is looking at him.
KENNY
-- run the blockade.
They'll run the
blockade.
ADMIRAL GEORGE ANDERSON, 50s, dapper, the Chief of Naval
Operations, nods from the far end of the table.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Which is exactly what they appear to be
preparing to do, Mr. President.
We're
tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba.
There's no sign they're changing course.
The closest ships, the Gagarin and the
Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line
by this time tomorrow.
MCNAMARA
We're concerned about the possibility of
an incident with an innocent cargo
carrier.
If it turns ugly, the Russians
could use an ugly incident and bad world
opinion as leverage to force us to
remove the quarantine.
MCCONE
Or they could use it as an excuse to
escalate.
BOBBY
Admiral Anderson, if the ships do not
stop, what exactly are our rules of
engagement?
Anderson signals A BRIEFING OFFICER who hits the lights and
an overhead projector which SMASH CUTS TO:
The bridge of the U.S.S. John Pierce, a Gearing class
destroyer.
A RADIO OPERATOR addresses a mike in Russian.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON (V.O.)
Russian-speakers have been transferred
to all of our ships.
Once the
quarantine takes effect in the morning,
our ships will attempt to make radio
contact with the approaching vessels.
They will be ordered to reduce speed and
prepare for inspection.
MARINES in flak jackets grab M-16s off a rack, race by.
All eyes are on Admiral Anderson's overhead projections.
Bobby, restless, gets up, begins pacing.
BOBBY
What happens if the ship doesn't stop
for inspection or want to be towed?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
A warning shot will be fired across its
bow.
Bobby stops, stares directly at the Admiral.
BOBBY
And what happens if the ship ignores the
warning shot?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Then we fire at its rudder, disable it,
and carry out the inspection.
Kenny looks at the President who remains unmoved, unreadable.
THE PRESIDENT
There will be no shooting without my
explicit orders.
Is that understood?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Yes, sir.
The President glances at McNamara.
THE PRESIDENT
Well, Admiral, it looks like it's up to
the Navy.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
The Navy won't let you down, sir.
THE PRESIDENT
General, have we developed any more
information on the missiles?
GENERAL TAYLOR
They are continuing to proceed with the
development.
We're commencing low-level
photography runs this morning.
MCCONE
The pictures will be used to firm up our
estimates of the missiles' readiness and
develop target packages for strikes
should you order them.
GENERAL TAYLOR
Our guy running this show is the best.
Commander Bill Ecker of the Navy's VFP
62, the Fightin' Photo.
Something of a
character, but the highest efficiency
ratings we've ever had.
He pushes Ecker's personnel file across the table, and as the
President opens it, on ECKER'S PHOTO, we SMASH CUT TO:
The man himself, COMMANDER BILL ECKER, 30s, playing cards,
smoking cigars with his wingman, LIEUTENANT BRUCE WILHEMY and
the PILOTS of VFP-62, the 'Fightin' Photo.'
They lounge,
tinker with equipment.
Their ready room is filled with pin
ups, movie posters, and all things photographic.
ECKER
75 millimeter, I'm listening.
On the
big screen there's nothing like it.
The other pilots heckle him, but are muted by Taylor.
GENERAL TAYLOR (V.O.)
To protect our pilots, we're prepared to
retaliate against any SAM site or anti
aircraft battery that opens fire.
WILHEMY
Watch out, Hollywood.
There's a new
epic director in town!
EXCOM listens in sober silence.
GENERAL TAYLOR
We have a flight of Thunderchiefs able
to respond within minutes of an attack
on our planes.
Kenny catches the President's eye.
Kenny glances at the
door.
Step outside, I need to talk to you.
The President and Kenny stand in front of the President's
desk.
All the doors are shut.
Weak sunlight filters into
the hushed room as if to a confessional.
KENNY
I don't like what's happening.
THE PRESIDENT
In the morning I'm taking charge of the
blockade from the situation room.
McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot
at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things
there.
KENNY
All right.
'Cause you get armed
boarders climbing into Soviet ships,
shots being fired across bows...
THE PRESIDENT
I know, I know...
KENNY
What about these low-level flights?
They're starting in what?
An hour?
Do
you realize what you're letting yourself
in for?
THE PRESIDENT
We need those flights.
We have to know
when those missiles become operational,
because when they do, we need to destroy
them.
KENNY
Fair enough.
But Castro's on alert and
we're flying attack planes over their
sites, on the deck.
There's no way for
them to know they're carrying cameras,
not bombs.
They're going to be shot at,
plain and simple.
Kenny's right, and the President looks away in frustration.
KENNY (CONT'D)
I'm your political advisor, and I'm
giving you political analysis here.
This is a setup.
The Chiefs want to go
in.
It's the only way they can redeem
themselves for the Bay of Pigs.
They
have to go in, and they have to do it
right.
It's that simple.
THE PRESIDENT
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
Thep President stares intently at Kenny.
Kenny glances at
the door, his voice hushed.
He hesitates.
KENNY
They're boxing us in with these rules of
engagement.
If you agree to 'em, and
one of our planes gets knocked down or
one of the ships won't stop for
inspection, the Chiefs will have us by
the balls and will force us to start
shooting.
They want a war, and they're
arranging things to get one.
If you
don't want one, we have to do something
about it.
The President understands.
He shakes his head, paces away.
THE PRESIDENT
How does a man get to a place where he
can say, 'throw those lives away,' so
easily?
KENNY
Maybe it's harder for them to say it
than they let on.
At the very least, they believe it's in
our best interest.
And at the end of
the day, they may end up being right.
The President turns away, considers.
Then turns back.
THE PRESIDENT
Triple check everything the Chiefs say
to us with the guys who actually have to
do it.
No one's to know about this but
Bobby.
I need redundant control over
what happens out there.
And if things
aren't as advertised, you're going to
make sure they come out the way I want
them to come out, starting with this low
level flight thing.
Jesus Christ...Kenny is daunted.
For a beat he just stares.
KENNY
That's going to be tough.
You know how
these guys are about their chains of
command...
THE PRESIDENT
Any problems, you remind them those
chains of commands end at one place.
Me.
Kenny and the President head for the Cabinet Room.
Rusk
comes out before they get there.
RUSK
Mr. President. The OAS meeting starts in
an hour.
I haven't prepared at all.
We
can't expect --
THE PRESIDENT
-- we need this one, Dean.
The
quarantine's legal if we get a mandate,
otherwise it's an act of war in the eyes
of the world.
Get me that vote.
Make
it unanimous.
RUSK
Mr. President, The Organization of
American States hasn't had a unanimous
vote since --
The President moves for the Cabinet Room.
THE PRESIDENT
-- unanimous, Dean.
Kenny slaps the dismayed Rusk on the back, heads off down a
hall away from the Cabinet Room.
Kenny opens the door to the White House switchboard room.
A
half-dozen OPERATORS work their lines, making connections on
the old-fashioned switchboard.
Unnoticed, he sizes them up,
their skill.
They're all courteous, pretty, professional.
The CAMERA PANS down the line... and stops on a middle-aged
matron at the end - the sternest, most scary of them all.
Her name is MARGARET.
MARGARET
White House Operator.
Yes sir.
(beat, harsh, booming)
Speaker McCormack, hold for the Vice
President.
Her voice is so severe, so smoker-gravelled, it makes the
blood run cold.
This is the woman Kenny's looking for.
KENNY
Ma'am, would you mind helping me out
with a few special calls?
Ecker, Wilhemy and their Pilots are in angry debate.
ECKER
Orson Welles is a hack.
Now you want to
talk about a director, you talk about
David Lean...
WILHEMY
Welles is a G-d.
Lean's the hack.
ECKER
Bullshit, Bruce, nobody but Lean is
making decent movies these days.
(to Young Pilot)
Get that fixed yet?
Nearby, a YOUNG PILOT tinkers with a $300,000 spy camera.
YOUNG PILOT
Uhhh... yup.
Think so.
Suddenly, the door opens and a pale DUTY SERGEANT enters.
DUTY SERGEANT
Sir...telephone, sir.
Ecker enters, marches over to the phone.
All the SOLDIERS in
the room stare at him.
Ecker wiggles his cigar to a corner
of his mouth, picks up, styling.
ECKER
VFP-62, Fightin' Photo, here.
But what
we really want to do is direct.
INTERCUT CALL TO:
Margaret works her magic.
MARGARET
This is the White House Operator.
Hold
for the President.
Ecker blinks, becomes a mild lamb.
ECKER
Oh shit.
MARGARET
Honey, you don't know what shit is.
BEGIN INTERCUT
Kenny, sitting on his desk, taps his fingers, looks at the
phone.
He's kept Ecker on hold long enough - and picks up.
KENNY
Commander, my name is Ken O'Donnell.
Special Assistant to the President.
INTERCUT CALL TO:
Ecker exhales.
It's not the President, but Ecker is so
shaken up it might as well be.
ECKER
Yes, sir.
KENNY (O.S.)
The President has instructed me to pass
along an order to you.
(beat)
You are not to get shot down.
Did he hear right?
ECKER
Uh... we'll do our best, sir.
KENNY
I don't think you understand me
correctly.
You are not to get shot down
under any circumstances.
Whatever
happens up there, you were not shot at.
Mechanical failures are fine; crashing
into mountains, fine.
But you and your
men are not to be shot at, fired at,
launched upon.
Ecker sits down in a chair, sobered.
ECKER
Excuse me, sir, what's going on here?
Kenny stands, drops the hard nose bullshit.
KENNY
Commander, if you are fired upon, the
President will be forced to attack the
sites that fire on you.
He doesn't want
to have to do that.
It's very important
that he doesn't, or things could go very
badly out of control.
Ecker lets out a long breath.
ECKER
I think I understand.
What about my
men?
If it comes up hot and heavy, and
we don't have anyone to protect us...
I'm going to be writing letters to
parents.
I hate writing letters to
parents.
Kenny nods to himself, feeling.
He's done it himself.
KENNY
If the President protects you,
Commander, he may have to do it with the
Bomb.
Ecker doesn't want to be avenged with atomic weapons.
No
sane person would.
KENNY (V.O.)
I've known the man for fifteen years.
The problem is, he will protect you.
So
I'm asking: don't make him protect you.
Don't get shot at.
Ecker down, deeply affected.
Suddenly, A BELL RINGS.
A
TELETYPE goes off.
Ecker knows it's for him.
His orders.
ECKER
Okay, Mr. O'Donnell.
We'll do what we
can.
END INTERCUT.
As Ecker hangs up, the Duty Officer rips off the ORDERS,
hands them to Ecker, who takes one look, then gazes out the
window at the runway --
As the canopy closes, Ecker powers up the engines, talks to
his flight over the Guard channel.
ECKER
Okay, time to play Spin the Bottle with
our bearded buddy.
Nobody gets out
ahead.
Remember, just sitting here
we're only ten minutes from target.
The ocean shrieks past so close you can see the white foam.
Ecker checks the altimeter: 150 FEET.
A small fishing boat looms ahead, its net booms reaching up
like tree limbs.
The Crusader rockets over it.
Ecker checks his instruments.
OUT THE WINDOW, the other
Crusaders thunder over the water, past sailboats, cabin
cruisers, the small-craft traffic outside Key West.
The
speed sucks the breath away.
ECKER
Go to military throttle on my mark.
Three...two...one... mark.
His airspeed indicator spins up to 400 knots.
And then his
radio suddenly crackles:
PILOT #1 (O.S.)
Flameout flameout!
PILOT #2 (O.S.)
Shit!
Me too!
ECKER
Get some altitude!
Two of the Crusaders pull up, away from the water.
PILOT #1 (O.S.)
Oh, God damn.
Got it restarted.
PILOT #2 (O.S.)
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me too.
Goddamn fuel.
PILOT #1 (O.S.)
Sir, I don't think she's gonna hold up
for the run.
ECKER
Affirmative.
You two get out of here.
Cuba, green and hazy, looms in the window.
Ecker throws a
series of switches.
ECKER
Start your camera checks.
A mechanical WHINE accompanies the switch-throwing.
Ecker
pulls the trigger on his joystick and a THUMP THUMP THUMP
hammers away.
There are green lights across his boards.
One of the other pilots cuts in on the radio:
PILOT #3 (O.S.)
Failure.
All cameras.
Sonofabitch.
Film must not have fed.
PILOT #4 (O.S.)
Jesus!
Shit!
Oh shit!
I just shot it
all, boss.
Activator jammed open, its
exposing everything now.
WILHEMY (O.S.)
That's alright, Lenny, it happens to
most men at some time --
Ecker grimaces, but his voice stays cool.
ECKER
-- Scrub, you two.
Get out of here.
Still with me, Bruce?
WILHEMY (O.S.)
That's affirm.
The two Crusaders who've failed their camera checks break
off.
And now Cuba's hills, the Havana sky line are right in
front of them.
Wilhemy jinks left to avoid a streaking of TRACER FIRE.
WILHEMY
Holy shit!
Tracers and flack pepper the air in front of Ecker's
Crusader.
METAL PINGS, TINKS, RATTLES off the fuselage.
Anti-aircraft and small arms fire comes up from all over,
hitting the planes multiple times.
He surveys the shapes in
the target zone dead ahead.
ECKER
Lights.
And sees the long, canvas-covered objects on the ground.
The
missiles.
They draw closer.
ECKER (CONT'D)
Camera.
A steel fragment CRACKS his window, obscuring our view.
ECKER (CONT'D)
Action.
And he thumbs the CAMERA SWITCH.
All twelve B-system cameras
begin banging away like cannons.
Kenny paces by the phone.
It rings.
He picks up, listens,
reacts.
Relief.
And we know the planes have made it back.
In Kenny's credenza, a small black and white T.V. plays.
WALTER CRONKITE narrates on the television as a train laden
with TANKS on flatbeds pulls out of a station.
WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.)
Massive military preparations are
underway throughout the southeast in
what Pentagon officials are confirming
is the largest mobilization since Korea.
The railways have been nationalized to
assist in the deployment, here
transporting elements of the U.S. 1st
Armored Division from Ft. Hood, Texas.
A PHONE RINGS.
Kenny turns from the T.V., turns down Walter
Cronkite, as he answers.
KENNY
Yeah?
George Ball stands at the back of a crowded room filled with
applauding OAS DELEGATES.
It's for Rusk, at a podium up
front.
BALL
Kenny.
The vote just came down.
Kenny opens his door, lets Rusk in.
The President, Bobby and
half of EXCOM look up.
Rusk stands there somber.
RUSK
Unanimous.
One abstenation.
And then he breaks into a huge grin.
Everyone cheers him.
THE PRESIDENT
About time something went our way.
An Assistant enters behind Kenny.
Kenny senses him, turns as
the others move to shake hands with Rusk.
ASSISTANT
Telephone, Mr. O'Donnell.
Kenny, grinning, ducks back into his office, closes the door
after the Assistant leaves.
He picks up the phone.
KENNY
Hello?
INTERCUT CALL TO:
Ecker stands at a phone, stares out a window at a replacement
plane being fueled.
A Crusader, not his shot-up one.
ECKER
Mr. O'Donnell, I've been ordered to
deliver the film to the Pentagon
personally.
What's going on?
Kenny thinks fast.
Oh shit.
KENNY
The Chiefs must want to talk to you.
(beat)
Listen to me, Commander, they'll want to
know if you were fired on.
Were you?
ECKER (O.S.)
You could say that, sir.
KENNY
Commander.
Do not, under any
circumstances, tell the Chiefs.
END INTERCUT
SUPER: E-RING.
Then SUPER: THE PENTAGON
Ecker, still in his sweat-drenched flight suit approaches a
security checkpoint.
GUARDS secure his sidearm and user him
through a doorway.
A sign over it reads JCS.
The door swings open into the Joint Chiefs' SOUND-PROOFED
briefing room known as THE TANK.
LeMay, Taylor and Anderson
sit there around the table.
Ecker salutes.
ECKER
Commander William B. Ecker reporting as
ordered!
LeMay rises, prowls over to Ecker.
LEMAY
Son , I want to know just one thing.
Those bastards shoot so much as a BB gun
at you?
A long beat.
Sweat runs off Ecker's head.
He can smell
LeMay's breath.
ECKER
Sir, it was a milk run, sir.
Kenny joins the President and General Taylor in the hallway
as they head for the Oval Office.
GENERAL TAYLOR
It appears our low-level flights are
getting back okay.
Some unconfirmed
reports of small-arms fire from some of
the missions, but that's it.
Slightly behind them, Kenny looks sidelong at Taylor.
THE PRESIDENT
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few
patriotic farmers.
And the ships?
GENERAL TAYLOR
Still heading for Cuba.
THE PRESIDENT
All right.
Then I guess it's time.
FLASHBULBS go off all around the room as the President walks
in, goes over to his desk.
Reporters observe silently, T.V.
cameras track him; Kenny, Bobby and Sorensen watch as the
President sits, takes a pen form his pocket.
THE PRESIDENT
In accordance with this afternoon's vote
at the OAS, the quarantine shall hereby
be effective as of ten o'clock tomorrow
morning.
Kenny observes in silence as the President SIGNS the
Proclamation of Interdiction.
The Oval Office has emptied out.
Only Kenny, Bobby, Sorensen
and the President remain.
The President looks out the
window, Sorensen sits in a chair in front of the desk.
Bobby
and Kenny sit on the edge of the desk.
THE PRESIDENT
Last summer I read a book.
The Guns of
August.
I wish every man on that
blockade line had read that book.
The President moves over to the GLOBE by his desk, spins it,
stopping in on Europe.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
World War One.
Thirteen million killed
all because the militaries of both
alliances were so highly attuned to each
other's movements and dispositions,
afraid of letting the other guy have a
theoretical advantage.
And your man in
the field, his family at home, couldn't
even tell you the reasons why their
lives were being sacrificed.
(beat)
Why couldn't they stop it?
Can we?
The President's fingers turn the globe.
It stops on
North America.
Kenny and Bobby listen.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
And here we are, fifty years later.
One
of their ships resists the inspection.
We shoot out its rudder and board.
They
shoot down our planes in response.
We
bomb their anti-aircraft sites in
response to that.
They attack Berlin.
We invade Cuba.
They fire their
missiles.
We fire ours.
The President sets the globe gently spinning and walks away.
Kenny rubs his eyes, listens to his phone and the WOMAN'S
VOICE at the other end.
It's his wife.
HELEN (O.S.)
When are you going to be home?
KENNY
I don't know, Helen.
I want you to keep
the kids close tomorrow.
Leave the T.V.
on, sleep with it on in the bedroom
until I tell you you can turn it off.
HELEN (O.S.)
What's happened?
KENNY
Nothing.
Nothing you don't know about.
Tomorrow's the big day.
Just have the
car ready to go if I call or if the
Civil Defense Warning comes on.
HELEN (O.S.)
What happens to you?
I'm not leaving
without you.
KENNY
I'll be evacuated with the President.
A long silence on the other end of the line.
HELEN (O.S.)
Great.
So while you're under a rock
somewhere with the President, what am I
supposed to do with your five children?
And to that, there is no answer.
A beat, and it's all Kenny
can promise:
KENNY
I'll find you.
But we're not going to
let it come to that.
I promise.
Kenny hands Bobby and Bundy cups of coffee.
The three men
nurse them in the silence of the abandoned cafeteria.
KENNY
Helen just asked me what sort of
arrangements we have for the families.
BUNDY
I just checked myself.
(beat)
They're being issued identity cards.
Call comes, and evacuation officers meet
them at pre-arranged departure areas.
They go by helicopter to Mount Weather.
We meet them there.
Bobby looks at his coffee, then up at Kenny.
He gently
shakes his head.
It's all a sham.
BOBBY
Course that's for morale.
The missiles
only take five minutes to get here.
SUPER: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 24TH.
DAY 9.
Kenny bolts upright from his couch.
He rubs his face, sits
on the edge in the dark for a beat.
He's not going back to
sleep.
He grabs his trousers.
Kenny makes his way through the dim, deserted halls.
Somewhere in the distance a phone rings.
He reaches a door.
Kenny's WATCH reads one minute til ten o'clock.
PULL BACK TO
REVEAL:
Kenny, standing just inside the open doors to the White House
Situation Room, a state-of-the-art conference room.
A long,
central table surrounded by leather chairs with phones and
screens built in.
T.V. monitors hang from the ceilings in
the corners.
There are no windows, just oppressive bunker
like walls.
It's far underground.
Across the room the President paces, phone in hand.
Half of
EXCOM is in their seats.
The other half, along with a steady
stream of DUTY OFFICERS, are coming and going.
Kenny steps
aside for a Duty Officer, listens to the President.
THE PRESIDENT
Okay, Bob, I'm putting you on intercom.
Suddenly, McNamara's VOICE fills the room.
MCNAMARA (O.S.)
Hey, guys, can you hear me?
SMASH CUT TO:
McNamara stands, phone in hand.
MCNAMARA
I have one minute til ten here --
THE CAMERA TRACKS AROUND HIM, REVEALING:
A large, elaborate war room, like Mission Control.
Big
screens, plexiglass tracking boards, tiered banks of
communications equipment.
A massive LIGHT TABLE on the floor
at the center of the room projects a map of the Caribbean and
Atlantic.
Arcing across it is a RED LINE: the blockade.
The map is covered with cryptic military notations; WATCH
OFFICERS on a platform which swings out over it update the
latest ship positions.
McNamara's in a booth overlooking the room.
It's open to the
next tier below where Admiral Anderson is giving orders.
MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
-- and no sign of them stopping.
Kenny and Bobby move to the President's end of the table, sit
down across from each other in mirror-image fashion.
EXCOM
looks to the President.
The second hand of the clock on the
wall wheels past 12.
A hush falls over the room.
THE PRESIDENT
Bob, the quarantine is now in effect.
McNamara is mute for a beat.
He turns to view the big room.
MCNAMARA
Then it looks like our first customers
are the Gagarin and Kimovsk.
He nods to Admiral Anderson, who calls an order down to a
Watch Officer on the floor, and on screens all around the
room, a sector of the map MAGNIFIES the unfolding encounter --
The Captain ducks into the CIC.
The CHIEF SONARAN reports.
CHIEF SONARMAN
Submerged contact, designation Sierra
one at 6000 yards bearing 030.
CAPTAIN
A submarine...
The President reacts.
Kenny and Bobby react.
GENERAL TAYLOR
It's protecting the freighters.
Consternation.
The President picks up the phone.
THE PRESIDENT
Bob, is there any way we can avoid
stopping a submarine first?
MCNAMARA (O.S.)
I'm afraid not, Mr. President.
The sub
has positioned itself between the Pierce
and the Soviet ships.
Admiral Anderson
insists it's too much of a risk to
proceed with stopping the freighters.
The Pierce would be a sitting duck for
the sub.
All around the room frustration.
Bobby shakes his head.
Kenny sinks back in his chair.
The President hesitates.
THE PRESIDENT
Put me through to the Pierce.
Admiral Anderson nods to a COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER.
The man
makes the connection on a switchboard.
McNamara casts an eye to the map.
The two red MARKERS
labeled Gagarin and Kimovsk are joined by a third: the SUB.
They are ALMOST TOUCHING the blockade line.
On the other
side, the single blue marker for the Pierce.
The Captain enters the bridge, takes the phone from the arm
of his chair.
CAPTAIN
Mr. President?
The President holds the phone, agonized.
THE PRESIDENT
Captain, can you force that submarine to
the surface for inspection without
damaging it yourself?
CAPTAIN
I can bring it up, Mr. President.
But
whether it's damaged or not is up to the
sub.
The President lowers the phone, looks to Bobby and Kenny.
MCCONE
Even if they force it up, that sub will
be inspected over the crews' dead
bodies.
They'd be executed for allowing
it when they got home.
All eyes are on the President.
His eyes are closed tight,
face gray, hand over his mouth.
The time of decision is at
hand.
He lifts the phone once again.
THE PRESIDENT
Captain, force the sub to the surface
for inspection.
MCNAMARA (O.S.)
Mr. President!
We're receiving reports
that the ships are stopping!
THE PRESIDENT
(to phone)
Captain, belay that order!
(to McNamara)
Bob, where's that coming from!
MCNAMARA (O.S.)
Just a second, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
McCone jumps up, leaves the room.
The President looks at
Kenny, tense.
Everyone holds their breath.
RUSK
Are they stopping?
The HISS of static on the open line fills the room.
Silence.
The HISS of static.
And then.
MCNAMARA (O.S.)
Mr. President?
McNamara is grinning wildly at the chaos unfolding in the
flag plot below.
Phones are ringing everywhere.
ON THE LIGHT TABLE
The Watch Officers' hands fly from one notation to the other,
circling the Soviet ships, marking them DEAD IN THE WATER.
MCNAMARA
-- we've got reports coming from all
over!
The ships are stopping!
Some...
are turning around!
The room EXPLODES, victorious.
Kenny and Bobby break into
big grins, grab each other.
Kenny pumps the President's
hand.
Rusk and Bundy slap each other on the back.
RUSK
We were eyeball to eyeball and I think
the other fellow just blinked.
The ruckus goes on for a minute.
McCone comes back in.
MCCONE
Mr. President.
His voice is lost in the celebration.
McCone calls out:
MCCONE (CONT'D)
Mr. President!
The hubub dies away.
MCCONE (CONT'D)
Sir, we have the tally from NSA.
We
have twenty ships stopping and or
turning around.
Six, however, appear to
be continuing for the line.
Including
the Gagarin and Kimovsk.
The elation goes out of the room.
Kenny looks at the
President.
The President picks up the phone again.
THE PRESIDENT
Captain, have the ships you're observing
changed course?
CAPTAIN (O.S.)
No, Mr. President.
They've just crossed
the quarantine line.
Bobby grips the edge of the table, immediately believing.
BOBBY
It's an accident.
They must not have
gotten their orders yet.
Let 'em go.
GENERAL TAYLOR
Unlikely, Mr. President.
We've been
monitoring transmissions from both the
Gagarin and Kimovsk.
Their radios are
working fine.
MCCONE
One ship, an accident maybe.
Six: this
is intentional.
The President looks to Bobby.
He has no answer.
Kenny's
mind races over the variables, and he leans forward, intense,
suddenly understanding in a flash of insight:
KENNY
They're right.
This is intentional.
He glances around the room.
All of EXCOM is looking at him.
Bobby stares at Kenny, too shocked to feel betrayed.
KENNY (CONT'D)
Khruschev's stopped the 20 ships which
are carrying contraband, and he's
letting the ones which aren't go
through, hoping for an incident.
I
think we should let them go.
Bobby relaxes.
Around the table there are nods.
MCCONE
If we do, it erodes the credibility of
the quarantine.
He'll just send more
through tomorrow.
The President looks at Kenny.
KENNY
Then we deal with it tomorrow.
But
today he's stopped most of them.
He's
done something smart here.
We gave him
an ultimatum, and he's agreed to most of
it, preserving just enough room to save
face.
We need to do something just as
smart now.
Bobby's nodding, following the argument.
Kenny looks around
the room for support.
McNamara, pacing on the phone, jumps in.
MCNAMARA
Mr. President, I agree.
Let them go.
Four of the six continuing ships are
still a day away from the line.
They've
stopped all the ones we suspect have
weapons aboard.
It would look bad shooting up a
freighter full of baby food.
The President holds Kenny's gaze, then lifts the phone.
THE PRESIDENT
Captain, I want you to maintain contact
with those ships.
Do nothing until I
order otherwise.
Is that clear?
CAPTAIN (O.S.)
Yes, Mr. President.
Contact only.
He hangs up, turns to Kenny.
THE PRESIDENT
I hope you're right.
Kenny and McNamara enter the White House from the South Lawn.
They stride down the hall, side by side.
KENNY
Moving the line.
Stroke of genius.
MCNAMARA
(snappish)
Of course it is.
But the President
needs to realize we're going to have to
stop a ship eventually.
They turn a corner, silence for a beat.
KENNY
The Chiefs are looking for a provocation
out there.
The President's going to
come under enormous pressure.
You have
to keep 'em on a short leash, Bob.
McNamara spares Kenny a short, nasty look.
MCNAMARA
You must think I'm blind and stupid.
I've already gotten the birds and bees
from Bobby.
The President doesn't have
to double-barrel me.
KENNY
Listen to me, goddamn it.
We're talking
about a possible nuclear war.
You
dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
MCNAMARA
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't
drop --
KENNY
You were in the room.
It was your
purview.
It was your job to make sure
Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you
didn't do it.
You've got the most
important job in the world right now.
You're the smartest guy the President
has.
(beat)
Besides me.
That gets an amused snort from McNamara, breaking the
tension.
MCNAMARA
Anybody ever tell you you're an
egomaniac and a prick, O'Donnell?
Kenny stares him in the eye, serious, hushed.
A friend.
KENNY
You need to be the best you've ever
been.
McNamara enters the elevator.
He turns, stands there facing
Kenny for a dramatic beat.
Then the doors close.
WALTER CRONKITE, on the B&W; T.V. screen, sits in front of a
map showing Cuba and the blockade line.
WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.)
-- well, it appears the world has just
received a reprieve.
Defense Secretary
Robert McNamara has announced that the
quarantine zone has been moved from 800
to 500 miles.
PULL BACK, REVEALING:
Kenny watching the T.V., is yelling at the phone.
KENNY
Find out how close our exercises are
coming to their cruise missiles.
I'm
calling you back in five, and you will
have an answer for me or I will come
down there and beat the shit out of you.
(beat)
Then you can press charges, and I'll get
a Presidential pardon.
He hangs up, hears SHOUTING from the Oval Office.
He goes to
the door, enters --
-- and sees the President leaning over his desk, jabbing his
finger at General Taylor.
THE PRESIDENT
-- how the goddamn hell did this happen?
I'm going to have Power's head on a
platter next to LeMay's!
(noticing Kenny)
Hey, Kenny, did you hear me give the
order to go to DEFCON 2?
I remember
giving the order to go to DEFCON 3, but
I must be suffering from amnesia because
I've just been informed our nuclear
forces are DEFCON 2!
Kenny realizes he's not joking as he spots Bobby sitting on
the couch behind Taylor, pale as a ghost.
Taylor, embattled,
wants to die, but stands there like a man.
SMASH CUT TO:
CLOSE ON
The nose cone of a TITAN MISSILE, its 20 megaton nuclear
warhead wrapped in the steel re-entry shell.
Cold, silent,
fearsome.
GENERAL TAYLOR (V.O.)
Mr. President, the orders were limited
to our strategic forces in the
continental U.S.
Taylor continues on.
GENERAL TAYLOR
Technically, General LeMay is correct
that SAC has the statutory authority --
The President punches his desk.
THE PRESIDENT
-- I have the authority.
I am the
commander-in-chief of the United States,
and I say when we go to war!
GENERAL TAYLOR
We are not at war, sir, not until we're
at DEFCON 1.
THE PRESIDENT
General, the Joint Chiefs have just
signalled our intent to escalate to the
Soviets.
You have signalled an
escalation which I had no wish to
signal, and which I did not approve.
But Taylor knows this very well.
And the way he's suffering,
it's clear he's taking the heat for his underlings.
From
over on the couch Bobby chimes in:
BOBBY
LeMay... he's history.
The President glances at Kenny who stands there, speechless.
THE PRESIDENT
Get out of here, Max.
The General leaves.
Kenny closes the door, wanders deeper
into the office.
He looks from the President to Bobby.
There's a long, long beat of shocked silence.
KENNY
Jesus...
BOBBY
Rescind the order.
Can all the Chiefs.
Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the
Undersecretaries in charge.
KENNY
We can't do that, Bobby.
THE PRESIDENT
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2.
The Soviets will think we've gotten
sweet on them.
KENNY
And we can't purge the Chiefs.
Our
invasion talk will look like a bluff.
Or even that there's been an attempted
coup.
Bobby is disgusted, but knows they're right.
BOBBY
McNamara won't be able to handle them.
It's too much for one man...
(knowing look to Kenny)
...with all due respect to our heroic
fifth column.
The President collapses in his rocking chair.
Kenny leans
over the back of the sofa next to Bobby.
KENNY
We've got Khruschev's attention with the
blockade.
If we want a political
solution.
I think it's time to turn up
the diplomatic heat.
Cause if we let
this go on too long, we're going to find
ourselves in a war.
Bobby looks at the President, meaningful.
The President
turns to Kenny.
THE PRESIDENT
I've been considering a variation on one
of Stevenson's ideas.
We're going to
send up a trial balloon through Lippman.
The Jupiter missiles.
Kenny throws himself on a chair in the bedroom's sitting
area, newspaper in hand.
The President, buttoning his shirt
in a full-length mirror, sees him.
There's a TV on.
The
President selects a tie from a nearby rack, eyes the paper.
THE PRESIDENT
What's that?
KENNY
Oh, just a bunch of crap about
withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in
Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in
Cuba.
The President's eyes flick over to him in the mirror.
THE PRESIDENT
I don't want to listen to this again.
KENNY
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to
extortion, and NATO would never trust us
again.
We'll get clobbered in world
opinion.
THE PRESIDENT
It's a goddman trial balloon.
Trial is
the operative word, here.
KENNY
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
The President turns around, heads over to the T.V.
Kenny
folds his arms, disgusted.
THE PRESIDENT
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one
saying we need to move forward on a
political solution.
KENNY
Yeah, a good political solution.
ON THE T.V.
Live coverage of the United Nations Security Council
meetings.
Holding forth in Russian is VALERIAN ZORIN, 50s,
tough, likeable, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.N. and
chairman of the Security Council.
A translator relays the
meaning.
TRANSLATOR FOR ZORIN (O.S.)
We call on the world to condemn the
piratical actions of America...
RESUME
The President's jaw tightens.
He turns to Kenny.
THE PRESIDENT
You want to turn up the heat?
You call
Adlai.
Tell him to stick it to Zorin.
Kenny, phone to his ear, suffers as Bobby harangues him.
BOBBY
Adlai's too weak!
We have to convince
Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
KENNY
You can't take him out this late in the
game.
BOBBY
Zorin will eat him alive!
KENNY
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it.
The two of you don't need any advice to
get into trouble.
BOBBY
What's gotten into you?
Kenny throws the Lippman article at him.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Oh, still sore about this.
KENNY
Something your father would've come up
with.
Silence.
Terrible silence.
That paralyzes Bobby.
Kenny
stares at him.
He means it, but regrets it, too.
BOBBY
My father --
KENNY
-- I'm just trying to make a point.
This idea is that fucking bad.
But Bobby gets it.
Kenny shifts gears, lets it go.
KENNY (CONT'D)
Adlai can handle Zorin.
He knows the
inning and the score.
BOBBY
He better.
Because nobody thinks he's
up to this.
Nobody.
The U.S. suite is in frantic preparation, STAFFERS coming and
going.
Stevenson takes his phone from a SECRETARY.
ADLAI
Yes?
Kenny turns to gaze at his little T.V. in the credenza, U.N.
coverage continuing, as if he could see Adlai there.
KENNY
Adlai, it's Kenny.
How're you doing?
Adlai is packing up his briefcase.
ADLAI
Busy, Ken. What do you need?
Kenny rises from his chair, paces toward the T.V.
He pauses.
KENNY
The President told me to pass the word
to you: stick it to them.
Adlai looks around to his own T.V., showing the session going
on downstairs.
Zorin, ON CAMERA, dominates the council:
alternately bold, aggressive, and then reasonable.
Even in
Russian, with the lagging translation, he's formidable.
Kenny is watching exactly the same performance.
Zorin is
masterful.
Kenny knows it.
And when he talks to Adlai, it's
with the fatalism of a coach knowing he's putting his third
string quarterback in against the all-Pro linebacker.
KENNY
Adlai.
The world has to know we're
right.
If we're going to have a chance
at a political solution, we need
international pressure.
You got to be
tough, Adlai.
You need to find it, old
friend.
Adlai watches his Staffers leave his inner office.
He hears
Kenny, and everything Kenny is saying.
ADLAI
I hear you.
I'm glad it's you calling.
I thought it would be Bobby.
If they're
still sticking to their stonewall
strategy, I'll get 'em.
(beat)
Thanks, Ken.
Adlai lowers the phone to its cradle.
An ANXIOUS STAFFER
sticks his head in the door, a concerned, questioning look on
his face.
Adlai adjusts his tie.
HIS HAND IS SHAKING.
He notices it,
and manages a brave smile.
ADLAI (CONT'D)
I'm an old political cat, Jimmy.
(beat)
But I've got one life left.
Adlai, briefcase in hand, marches down the hall at the hand
of his team: Staffers and Photo Interpreters with large
leather portfolio bags.
The big double doors to the council
chamber loom, and he gestures to the Photo Interpreters.
ADLAI
Wait here.
And then a DOORMAN throws open the door for him.
Adlai enters.
He is instantly dwarfed by the enormous room.
Lights, T.V. cameras, the imposing circular arrangement of
delegation tables.
And the entire world is watching.
Adlai pauses.
Then as the first SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS
begin to notice him, he heads for the vacant seats for the
American delegation.
The ROMANIAN DELEGATE saws the air.
ROMANIAN DELEGATE
(through translator)
...we call upon the world to condemn
this purely American provocation...
But as the Romanian wheezes on, all eyes are on Adlai.
Adlai
takes his seat, his Staffers behind him.
They pass him up
papers, and he spreads them before him, taking no notice that
the entire room is staring at him.
Adlai finally glances up.
Across the circle sits Zorin, in
the flesh, at the head of his own tough-looking DELEGATION.
He acknowledges Adlai with a superior smile.
ROMANIAN DELEGATE (CONT'D)
We, the people of Romania, stand in
solidarity with the people of Cuba and
their revolution in the face of this
American threat to world peace.
Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.
The Romanian Delegate leans back from his microphone.
Zorin
leans forward, begins in Russian, and the Translator's voice
catches up with him.
His tone, body language, composure are
all that of complete confidence.
ZORIN
(through translator)
We are glad you could join us, Mr.
Stevenson.
Adlai nods, returns to his notes, as Zorin continues.
ZORIN (CONT'D)
For the last couple of hours I have
heard nothing but questions from the
world here.
The United States has led
us to the brink of calamity.
The
peoples of the world want to know why.
We are told again and again of this so
called incontrovertible evidence of
offensive weapons in Cuba.
Yet we are
not allowed to see this evidence.
Are
your spy planes so secret you cannot
share this evidence with us?
Some
planes?!
The audience laughs.
Zorin basks in it.
And then grows
stern.
ZORIN (CONT'D)
Or perhaps there is no such evidence.
Perhaps the United States is mistaken.
EXCOM watches the coverage on the situation room's T.V.'s.
The President and Bobby sit side by side, Kenny just behind
them.
Bobby checks his watch, looks at the President.
BOBBY
I make the call, and Adlai is out.
McCloy goes in.
Bobby looks back at Kenny.
THE PRESIDENT
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Zorin stares at Adlai.
Adlai studiously ignores him, works
on his own papers.
ZORIN
The United States has no facts in hand.
Falsity is what America has in its hands
- false evidence.
Zorin leans back in his chair.
Adlai finally looks up.
He
meets Zorin's icy bravura.
He notes the cameras around the
room.
This is the grandest stage of all.
ZORIN (CONT'D)
The chair recognizes the representative
from the United States.
And in that moment, Adlai becomes the spokesman for America.
ADLAI
Well, let me say something to you, Mr.
Ambassador, we do have the evidence.
We
have it, and it is clear and
incontrovertible.
Adlai's tone is definitive.
A tremor of interest passes
through the various delegations.
ADLAI (CONT'D)
And let me say something else.
Those
weapons must be taken out of Cuba.
You,
the Soviet Union, have created this new
danger, not the United States.
EXCOM is transfixed by the continuing debate.
BUNDY
Come on, Adlai!
They all crowd the T.V. as if it were a title fight.
Except
for Bobby.
Kenny glances over at him.
He has the phone
pinned between his ear and shoulder.
Kenny looks back to the
T.V.
Adlai fixes Zorin in his seat, his voice rising.
ADLAI
Mr. Zorin, I remind you that the other
day you did not deny the existence of
these weapons.
But today, again, if I
heard you correctly, you now say they do
not exist.
Zorin, headphones on, listens to his own translation, but
doesn't respond, acts bored.
It gets Adlai's goat, and he
begins to lose his cool.
A rumble from the U.N.
The CAMERA
FINDS Adlai's hand SHAKING, gripping his pen.
EXCOM is worried.
RUSK
Come on, Adlai, don't let him off!
BOBBY
John?
It's Bobby.
Get ready to send
your staffer in.
He's going to be
coming out.
But Adlai's tremors are not tremors of fear.
They are
tremors of anger.
His voice goes hard and cold.
ADLAI
All right, sir.
Let me ask you one
simple question.
Do you, Ambassador
Zorin, deny that the U.S.S.R. has placed
and is placing medium and intermediate
range missiles and sites in Cuba?
Yes
or no - don't wait for the translation -
yes or no?
The diplomatic world GASPS as Adlai drops all pretense of
civility, all statesman-like grace.
EXCOM's excitement mounts.
In the chorus urging Adlai on, we
find Kenny edge toward the screen.
KENNY
Yeah.
Yeah.
Zorin shoots Adlai a testy look.
ZORIN
I am not in an American courtroom, sir,
and therefore I do not wish to answer a
question that is put to me in the
fashion in which a prosecutor puts
questions.
In due course, sir, you will
have your answer.
There's laughter at Zorin's refusal to be bullied: but it's
nervous laughter, not the polite stuff of diplomatic tete-a
tete.
The RUMBLE in the room grows louder.
ADLAI
You are in the courtroom of world
opinion right now, and you can answer
yes or no.
You have denied they exist,
and I want to know if I have understood
you correctly.
EXCOM ROARS!
Fists in the air!
Bobby lets the phone dangle
a beat, covers it.
And then he lifts it again.
BOBBY
John, I'll get back to you.
He lowers the phone to the receiver.
Kenny shoots him a
triumphant smile.
The President looks at Kenny, shakes his
head, a big smile on his face.
Adlai presses on.
ADLAI
And I'm prepared to present the evidence
in this room, proving that the Soviet
Union has lied to the world.
And Zorin cracks.
He looks uneasily to his delegation.
They
bend forward to consult.
Adlai sits back in his chair,
draping his arms over its wings with the confidence of
someone who knows he's kicked ass.
Adlai looks around the room while he's waiting for his
answer, managing not to smile.
The diplomatic world is
scandalized.
At last Zorin regroups, lifts his head from his
huddle.
ZORIN
If you do not choose to continue your
statement, the Chair recognizes the
representative from Chile.
The CHILEAN DELEGATE stands.
CHILEAN DELEGATE
I yield my time and the floor to the
representative to the United States.
The room explodes in laughter.
Not just nervous any more,
not just polite.
They're laughing at Zorin's parliamentary
ploy blowing up in his face.
Zorin's smile is gone, his smooth facade destroyed.
And he
looks like the biggest fool in the world.
Adlai stares at the beet-faced man with disdain.
At last,
Adlai stands, gestures to the door to the hall behind him.
The PHOTO INTERPRETERS come racing in with their briefing
boards.
ADLAI
Well then, ladies and gentlemen, since
it appears we might be here for a while,
shall we have a look at what the Soviets
are doing in Cuba?
The Delegates RUMBLE in interest, rise from their seats to
approach Adlai.
EXCOM celebrates.
Phones ring at several of the chairs at
the conference table. The President and Kenny meet as Bundy
picks up a phone in the b.g.
THE PRESIDENT
Didn't know Adlai had it in him.
Too
bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
KENNY
Zorin must not have gotten instructions.
Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's
blown it big-time.
Bundy steps forward, holding the phone.
BUNDY
Mr. President...
Kenny and the President turn to see what they already have
heard in those two words: concern.
The room falls quiet.
Phone in hand, McNamara paces at his post over the flag plot.
MCNAMARA
...the ship is called Groznyy.
MCNAMARA
It crossed the line hours ago.
Admiral Anderson, on the phone on the level below, is tense.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Hail them again.
THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
Keep us posted, Bob.
McNamara leans against the wall, closes his eyes in
exhaustion and stress.
And when he opens the, we PAN AROUND
TO REVEAL:
A G-d-like view of the flag plot, covered with HUNDREDS OF
SHIPS, PLANES AND MARKINGS.
McNamara stares out at the bewildering tangle of symbols,
living men behind each one.
Each tangle of red and blue
symbols a powderkeg.
A G-dlike view indeed.
And it is far
more than any one mere man could keep control of. And he
begins to realize it.
MCNAMARA
We're kidding ourselves...
And not only that, in his bleary, sleep-deprived fog, he
begins to understand something happening down there.
The CAMERA MOVES over the enormous map, over the scrolling
cryptic numerology.
THE BUZZ of radio communications bleeds
in from the background.
The overhead platform swivels on its
motor, like the vast arm of some fate-writing god as the
Watch Officer on it updates the movements of the ships.
McNamara stares, at the verge of grasping something.
Through
the door-crack of genius, he has the glimpse of some grander
thing, some grander design.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Very well.
Load your guns.
That starts McNamara from his fatigued reverie.
He goes to
the railing, looks down on Anderson.
MCNAMARA
What was that, Admiral?
Anderson turns, gazes up from his tier below, distracted.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the
last hour, Mr. Secretary.
The Groznyy
refuses to stop.
MCNAMARA
What are you doing?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary.
If you don't mind, we're very busy right
now.
We need to be able to do our jobs.
MCNAMARA
Admiral, I asked you a question.
Anderson holds the phone aside, turns around again, looks up
at him, impatient.
His answer is hard, cold, dangerous.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
We're going to follow the Rules of
Engagement.
The Rules of Engagement
which the President has approved and
signed in his order of October 23rd.
Anderson listens again to the phone.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON (CONT'D)
Yes, Captain, you may proceed.
Clear
your guns.
MCNAMARA
What --
McNamara SHOUTS at Anderson, dropping down the steps to
Anderson's level.
MCNAMARA
GODDAMNIT, STOP THAT FIRING!
Watch Officers scramble to comply, chaos and shouting in the
war room as a chorus if "Cease fire cease fire cease fire,"
goes up.
McNamara turns on Anderson, is in his face.
MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
Jesus Christ, God help us.
Anderson smashes the phone down, wheels on McNamara, furious.
Anderson gets in McNamara's face.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
That ship was firing starshells.
Starshells.
Flares, Mr. Secretary.
Everyone's eyes are on the two men.
Only the chatter of
teletype breaks the paralyzing silence.
McNamara blinks,
looks down at the plot on the floor.
Anderson's voice drops
to a deadly sotto.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON (CONT'D)
Goddammitt, I've got a job to do.
You've been camped out up there since
Monday night.
You're exhausted and
you're making mistakes.
Interfere with
me, you will get some of killed.
I will
not allow that.
McNamara looks away at the faces of the men in the room.
MCNAMARA
Starshells.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary.
The
navy has been running blockades since
the days of John Paul Jones.
McNamara turns back.
And all trepidation, embarrassment,
hesitation are gone.
He coldly appraises Anderson.
MCNAMARA
I believe the President made it clear
that there would be no firing on ships
without his express permission.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we
were not firing on the ship.
Firing on
a ship means attacking the ship.
We
were not attacking the ship.
We were
firing over it.
MCNAMARA
This was not the President's intention
when he gave that order.
What if the
Soviets don't see the distention?
What
if they make the same mistake I just
did?
(beat)
There will be no firing anything near
ANY Soviet ships without my express
permission, is that understood, Admiral?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Yes, sir.
MCNAMARA
And I will only issue such instructions
when ordered to by the President.
(beat)
John Paul Jones... you don't understand
a thing, do you, Admiral?
He passes his hand over the enormous plot below.
MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
This isn't a blockade.
McNamara, trembling with anger, awe, whirls to Anderson.
And
his burgeoning insight is born - clear, hard and cold.
MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
This, all this, is language, a new
vocabulary the likes of which the world
has never seen.
This is President Kennedy communicating
with Secretary Khruschev.
McNamara JABS HIS FINGER OUT AT the plot, and --
-- the CAMERA RACES DOWN, TRACKING OVER IT, across the vast
ebb and flow of information, the delicate ballet of symbols
and numerology, this language of steel and human life.
SUPER: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26TH.
DAY 11.
On Kenny's T.V. Walter Cronkite reads the news to footage of
a BOARDING PARTY going up a ladder to the freighter MARCULA.
WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.)
At 7:29 this morning, the U.S.S. Joseph
Kennedy stopped and boarded the Soviet
charter vessel Marcula.
The Boarding Party wears dress whites and is UNARMED.
WALTER CRONKITE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
After a 3-hour inspection, the Kennedy
signaled no contraband found.
Cleared
to continue.
Pentagon spokesmen expect
the next encounter.
Kenny, who turns from the T.V. as the door to his office
opens.
Rusk walks in.
RUSK
Kenny, we need to see the President.
Something's happened.
Kenny reacts to Rusk's enigmatic expression.
And out from
behind Rusk steps JOHN SCALI, the ABC News Correspondent.
OFF THEIR REACTIONS, the CAMERA FINDS an under-strength, ad
hoc EXCOM - Kenny, Bobby, Taylor, Bundy, Sorensen, McCone,
Ball and the President.
Guarded hope all around.
The short,
balding, pugnacious Scali looks discomfited.
SCALI
I have lunch with him maybe once a
month.
Way he talks, he acts like he
knows Khruschev personally, but he's
never elaborated.
I've used him as a
source in a couple of stories.
Kenny paces behind the gathered men around the President's
desk, listening, mind going a million miles an hour.
RUSK
The FBI has identified this Alexander
Fomin as the Soviet Resident, the KGB
equivalent of one of our station chiefs.
He's their highest ranking spy in this
country.
And he knows John's a friend
of mine.
BUNDY
All the trademarks of a back-channel
overture.
Kenny eyes Bundy, makes him uncomfortable.
The President
sizes Scali up.
THE PRESIDENT
So they'll remove the missiles, and
we'll pledge not to invade Cuba,
destabilize Castro or assist anyone who
plans in doing so...
Nobody dares speak.
It's as if the possibility of a
settlement will vanish into thin air if anyone moves.
BOBBY
I think... this may be our first real
message from Khruschev.
MCCONE
The alternative, Mr. President, is that
this could be a trap.
KENNY
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in
negotiations, we come up short...
MCCONE
Why else would they approach us in this
way?
It's deniable.
The Soviets have
done nothing but lie to us.
This could
be more of the same.
KENNY
That may be why Khruschev's introducing
this guy.
We've been burned by his
usual players in the formal channels, so
he brings in an honest broker.
MCCONE
That may be what they want us to think.
RUSK
The truth is, Mr. President, we don't
even really know whom Fomin speaks for.
It could be Khruschev. It could be some
faction in the Politburo or the KGB
itself.
We just don't know.
BOBBY
By the way, Scali, your activities now
fall under the secrecy codicils of the
National Security Act.
Sorry, no
Pulitzer.
The gathered men chuckle, only Scali a bit dour but being a
good sport about it.
Scali checks his watch.
SCALI
Mr. President, we don't have much time.
I'm supposed to meet with him again in
three and a half hours.
THE PRESIDENT
Well, it seems the question of the day
is -- is the offer legitimate?
He moves away from his desk.
The men watch him.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
If it is... if it is, then we can't
afford to ignore it.
(beat, to Scali)
John, we'll have instructions for you in
a couple of hours.
Scali nods.
Rusk escorts him out.
They wait until the door
closes.
Taylor looks over at McCone who nods.
GENERAL TAYLOR
Mr. President, I'm afraid we have some
bad news.
We're getting GMAIC estimates
from our latest low-level overflights.
It appears the missiles are two to three
days away from operational status.
MCCONE
So we don't have much time to play out
back-channel communiques.
Kenny gives Bobby a hard look.
The President appears
unfazed.
GENERAL TAYLOR
The quarantine, sir, is not producing
results.
The Chiefs feel it's time you
take another look at our options.
The President considers Taylor, then looks over to Kenny.
THE PRESIDENT
Kenny, get over to your old stomping
grounds.
Go through everything the FBI
has on Fomin.
I need your best call: is
this guy legit and is he speaking for
Khruschev?
And I need you to tell me by
the time I call you, because right after
I call you, I'm calling Scali with his
instructions.
BANG!
A STACK OF FILES slams down beside Kenny on a large
paper-covered conference table.
WALTER SHERIDAN, Kenny's
investigator-buddy, wears a visitor's pass just like Kenny.
Kenny and Walter RIFLE through the folders, super fast, super
proficient.
A half-dozen FBI AGENTS work around the table.
SHERIDAN
Okay.
So, what we've got is this guy
Alexander Feklisov, aka Alexander Fomin,
declared Consul to the Soviet Embassy,
but in reality the KGB Papa Spy.
An
illustrious tour of duty during the
Great Patriotic War gets him on the
Party fast track, various tours of duty
in KGB, American postings.
He's an
expert on us, and... that's all we've
got on Papa Spy.
KENNY
Who's he talking for?
Is it Khruschev,
or is this more bullshit?
Kenny stands, runs his hands through his hair, aggravated.
KENNY (CONT'D)
How do you become the KGB top spy in the
United States?
SHERIDAN
Gotta know someone.
Kenny whirls on Sheridan.
A frozen beat.
KENNY
Politics is politics.
Walter.
(whirling on Agents)
Khruschev is the Moscow Party Boss under
Stalin.
Give me their career
chronologies!
Walter pushes a typed dateline of Khruschev's major career
moves, and one of the Agents hands Kenny a list of Fomin's
postings.
He lays them side by side.
And for every step of
Khruschev's, there's a step for Fomin.
Not only that, but
the DATES ARE IDENTICAL or nearly so.
KENNY (CONT'D)
Every time Khruschev moves up, Fomin
does within a year...
(tracing up the list)
Khruschev was the administrator in
charge of preparing Moscow's defenses
during the war.
And Fomin... was here
in the U.S.
Kenny's face falls.
But a YOUNG FBI AGENT cuts in.
YOUNG FBI AGENT
Not at first.
The Young FBI Agent proffers him a file.
Kenny snatches it.
YOUNG FBI AGENT (CONT'D)
He was an engineer stationed outside
Moscow in '42.
Specialized in tank
traps.
Kenny looks up at Walter.
Walter nods sagely, lights a pipe.
KENNY
They know each other.
They're war
buddies.
SHERIDAN
It's thin.
But real life usually is.
A PHONE on the table SHRILLS, shattering the silent triumph.
KENNY
Hello?
THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
I've got to move.
What do you have,
Kenny?
KENNY
They know each other!
Khruschev and
Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
You're sure...
KENNY
Don't take it to court, but we've got
good circumstantial evidence...
(off Walter's nod)
Walter agrees.
My gut's telling me
Khruschev's turning to a trusted old
friend to carry his message.
THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
Okay, Ken.
We're going.
A few lonely BUSINESS TRAVELERS hang out in the dim coffee
shop.
Faint music plays.
Scali and ALEXANDER FOMIN sit with
steaming cups of coffee.
Scali, nervous, unfolds a note.
Fomin, an expressionless gray spectre of a man, eyes him.
He
is, in his boredom, a spy's spy.
SCALI
I am instructed to tell you that the
American Government would respond
favorably to an offer along the lines
you have discussed.
If this solution
were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador
Zorin, he would find a favorable reply
from Ambassador Stevenson.
FOMIN
So I understand you correctly.
If the
missiles in Cuba were dismantled,
returned to the Soviet Union, and a
guarantee was made not to reintroduce
them, the United States would be
prepared to guarantee that it would
never invade Cuba?
SCALI
That is correct.
FOMIN
This is from the Highest Authority?
SCALI
Yes.
From the Highest Authority.
There
are two conditions.
The U.N.
must be allowed to inspect the removal
of the missiles.
FOMIN
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed
to observe the redeployment of forces
from the American Southeast.
Scali demurs.
He has no instructions on this count.
FOMIN (CONT'D)
And the second condition?
SCALI
Time is of the essence.
Scali takes a sip of coffee.
Fomin stares at him, intense.
FOMIN
John.
How much time?
SCALI
48 hours.
In 48 hours there can be no
deals.
Scali finishes debriefing the President, Bobby, Kenny,
McCone, Taylor and Bundy.
SCALI
He left right away.
Got the feeling he
meant business.
Kenny and Bobby share a hopeful glance.
Rusk enters from
Kenny's office.
And he's unable to contain his excitement.
RUSK
Mr. President, we're receiving a letter
from Khruschev over at State.
From a cluster of folding metal chairs, Kenny, Bobby, Rusk
and Sorensen watch a TELETYPE hammer out the message as it
comes off the wire.
It's painfully slow, like watching a bad
typist type a manuscript.
Ten pages of this is an eternity.
To top it off, it's in Russian.
A TRANSLATOR reads it off,
word by word to a TRANSCRIBER.
TRANSLATOR
...two...of...us...pull...on...the...
knot...of...war...
Kenny slams a page of Khruschev's letter on the table.
He
jabs his finger at it.
EXCOM listens, intent.
KENNY
It's ten pages of sentimental fluff, but
he's saying right here.
He'll remove
the missiles in return for a no-invasion
pledge.
It looks like Fomin's overture
was genuine.
The President turns to McCone.
MCCONE
Our early analysis says this was
probably written by Khruschev himself.
It's a first draft, and shows no signs
of being polished by the foreign
ministry.
In fact, it probably hasn't
been approved by the Politburo.
They
wouldn't have let the emotionalism go
by.
The analysts say it was written by
someone under considerable stress.
EXCOM chuckles.
THE PRESIDENT
Glad to hear we're not alone.
The President eyes the EXCOM members one by one, an incipient
smile on his face.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
Well, gentlemen, I wasn't planning on
invading Cuba anyway.
I think we can
live with the terms of this deal.
There are mostly nods of assent, big smiles around the table.
Except from
McCone and Taylor.
The President takes his copy
of the letter, flips through it.
He shakes his head, almost
unable to believe that Khruschev has given in.
A long beat.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
Ted, I want you to draft our acceptance.
SUPER: SATURDAY, OCTOBER 27TH.
DAY 12.
Kenny, in his overcoat, steps aside as a pair of Duty
Officers race past him, almost bowling him over.
He slows as he nears the doors to his office and the Oval
Office, DISCOVERING:
TOTAL CHAOS.
EXCOM guys, Assistants, dart to and from the
offices and halls.
On all their faces grim expressions.
Kenny stands there a beat in confusion.
And then Bobby
swings out of Kenny's office.
There's a desperate edge to
Bobby's voice.
BOBBY
Where've you been?
We've been trying to
find you all morning.
KENNY
Helen and I went out for breakfast.
EXCOM's not supposed to convene til
eight.
BOBBY
We just got a second letter from
Khruschev.
The deal's off.
Kenny and Bobby walk fast for the cabinet room, Kenny still
in his coat.
BOBBY
We're getting everyone together as fast
as we can.
KENNY
What does the letter say?
BOBBY
They want us to take our missiles out of
Turkey along with the no invasion
pledge.
It looks like Fomin was a ploy
after all, and they were just stalling
for time.
Kenny is stunned.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
It gets worse.
Kenny gives Bobby a sharp look as they enter --
The President, in shirtsleeves, no tie, glances up at Kenny
as he and Bobby enter.
Kenny can only bear his look for a
second: he blew the call on Fomin.
But the President is
clearly relieved to see him, gives him a faint smile.
Half of EXCOM, including McNamara, McCone, Rusk, and Taylor
barely notice them as they're already there arguing.
Kenny sits down hurriedly, shucks off his coat as he joins
the conversation in mid-stream.
MCCONE
My specialists are in agreement: this
morning's letter is not Khruschev.
Last
night's letter was.
(beat)
The evidence supports only one
conclusion: there has been a coup, and
Khruschev was replaced overnight.
KENNY
Jesus Christ...
Bobby gives him a look: told you things got worse.
THE PRESIDENT
Dean?
RUSK
It doesn't necessarily mean there's been
a coup.
Khruschev's name is signed to
the letter.
MCNAMARA
Aw, come on, Dean!
RUSK
But at the very least... It does suggest
he's been co-opted by hard line
elements.
MCNAMARA
Which at the end of the day is the same
thing as a coup.
A puppet Khruschev,
and a hard-line Soviet government
pulling the strings.
No deal.
And the
missiles are almost operational.
Bitter silence.
They all look to the President.
Imminent
victory has turned to ashes.
The President studies his own
folded hands.
Ball and Thompson enter, take seats.
One by
one, throughout the scene, other EXCOM members join the
group.
THE PRESIDENT
You know, the problem we have is that
this is latest offer of theirs will seem
reasonable to everyone.
We remove our
missiles, they remove theirs.
Our Jupiters were scheduled for removal
anyway.
They're obsolete, after all.
Kenny shakes his head in mute anger.
McNamara and Rusk seem
to sense the President's feelings, too.
RUSK
Mr. President, agreeing to such a trade
would be tantamount to paying ransom.
They'll put a gun to our head again, and
expect us to pay again.
Kenny looks the President in the eye.
KENNY
We can't sell out one of our friends for
our own safety.
NATO wouldn't trust us
anymore, and they'd be right not to.
The President sighs in the face of the stern advice.
He
nods, expecting as much.
Bobby still can't look at anyone.
THE PRESIDENT
So which one of you geniuses can tell me
how to explain ourselves to the world?
How do we work with them if there's been
a hard-line coup?
GENERAL TAYLOR
Mr. President, there is another
possibility we haven't considered.
This
may not be a coup at all.
Everyone of Kenny's instincts jumps.
His head snaps up to
listen to Taylor.
Taylor pauses.
GENERAL TAYLOR (CONT'D)
It's possible that the back-channel
overture, last night's letter, and this
letter today, along with everything the
Soviets have said all along, is nothing
more than a lie -- disinformation.
MCNAMARA
Designed to keep us from taking action.
Kenny hears the fatalism in McNamara's voice.
A long beat.
Everyone stares at McNamara.
MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
I hate to say it, but if I had to bet,
I'd bet Max is right.
What if they have
no intention of honoring this deal,
either?
Then tomorrow they add another
condition.
Meanwhile, the quarantine
isn't working and they're continuing to
work on the missile sites.
(beat)
I think we have to consider issuing
warning orders for our forces.
They were so close last night... and suddenly Lundahl and
LeMay enter the room with the day's briefing boards.
LUNDAHL
Mr. President...
Lundahl stands there at the end of the table, gray.
He
almost can't say it, can't look the President in the face.
LUNDAHL (CONT'D)
This morning's photography is in.
It
appears the Soviets have commenced a
crash program to ready the missiles.
SMASH CUT TO:
The news hits the room like a thunderbolt.
Kenny looks to
Bobby and the President.
The blood is gone from their faces.
MCNAMARA
Then we're out of time.
We have to go
in.
LUNDAHL
That may not be as easy as we thought
either.
We've gotten confirmation that
the Soviets have also deployed
battlefield nuclear weapons to Cuba.
A pall falls over the room as LeMay explains.
LEMAY
FROGS, we call 'em.
Short range
tactical nukes.
It's possible they've
delegated release authority to their
local commanders for use against our
invasion troops.
It'd be standard
doctrine.
(beat)
Our capability to get all the missiles
has eroded during our delay with the
quarantine.
The good news is that for
the moment we know where the FROGS are,
and we can target them, too.
But the
longer we wait, the hard it's going to
get.
They all look to the President.
Kenny stares, in a private
hell, blacker and more complete than anyone should ever know.
In that shocked silence each man grapples with failure.
The
Best and the Brightest could not prevent what must come next.
THE PRESIDENT
Then we have no choice.
(to
Taylor)
General, issue the warning orders to our
forces.
They will be prepared to
execute the air strikes Monday morning
and the follow-on invasion according to
the schedule thereafter.
I'll need the
official release orders on my desk
Sunday night.
GENERAL TAYLOR
Understood, sir.
We need to step up the
overflights, finalize our pilots' target
folders in order to be able to carry out
the strikes.
The President gives Kenny a meaningful look.
THE PRESIDENT
Permission granted.
Taylor exits.
Kenny rises, gives the President an almost
imperceptible nod, as he prepares to leave in Taylor's wake.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
Gentlemen, if anybody's got any great
ideas, now's the time...
MAJOR RUDOLPH ANDERSON, 30, wearing the bulky high-altitude
pressure suit of a U-2 pilot, takes the phone from one of the
Air Force NCOs who are helping him suit up.
MAJOR ANDERSON
This is Major Anderson.
INTERCUT CALL TO:
Kenny, at the other end of the line, stares out the window at
the fall day.
It seems so mild, so unlike war.
And it takes
him a beat before he realizes Anderson's on the line.
MAJOR ANDERSON (O.S.)
Hello?
Anyone there?
KENNY
Major, my name is Kenneth O'Donnell.
Special Assistant to the President.
Kenny takes a breath, ready to start the shuck-and-jive...
but for some reason doesn't.
KENNY (CONT'D)
Major, a few days ago the President
ordered me to help him keep control of
what's going on out there.
I've been
browbeating pilots, navy guys left and
right to make sure you don't get us here
in Washington into trouble.
But you
know what?
We're pretty damn good at
getting ourselves into trouble.
So
instead of riding your ass, I'm just
going to tell you what's going on, and
let you figure out how best to help us
out up here.
Now mostly suited up, Major Anderson takes the phone out of
the NCO's hand.
He nods, serious.
MAJOR ANDERSON
Go ahead, sir.
KENNY
Last night, we looked like we were going
to cut a deal to get us all out of this
mess.
Today, the Soviets are reneging.
We're going to try to salvage the
situation, but a lot of things are going
wrong today.
It's making everyone
nervous, and it will be very hard to
avoid going to war.
Don't get shot
down, Major.
Beyond that, whatever else
you can do to help us, I'd really
appreciate it.
Major Anderson waves his NCOs away.
They leave the room.
The Major sits on a bench in front of his locker, thinks.
MAJOR ANDERSON
When you're up there at 72,000 feet,
there's a million things that can go
wrong.
Is your oxygen mix right?
Will
your cameras freeze up?
Are you leaving
contrail...
(beat)
Those million things are beyond your
control, mostly... But you know, when
you realize that, there's a kind of
peace.
You don't need to be in control.
You never were in control in the first
place.
If you're a good man, and your
ground crew are good men, it's all you
can ask for.
And with the grace of G-d,
it'll get you through.
The young Major smiles to himself, to the phone.
MAJOR ANDERSON (CONT'D)
You sound like a good man.
You'll be
all right, Mr. O'Donnell.
We believe in
you guys down here.
(beat)
Thanks for the call.
Kenny nods to himself, deeply touched by the man's faith.
KENNY
Thank you, Major.
With a click, the line goes dead and Anderson walks the phone
over to the receiver on the wall.
END INTERCUT
Anderson switches over to the U-2's oxygen supply as his NCOs
belt him in.
They slap him on the helmet for good luck and
lower the canopy as he brings his engines up to power.
MAJOR ANDERSON
This is flight G3132, requesting
permission for take-off.
TOWER VOICE (O.S.)
G3132, you've got runway one, you are
cleared to proceed to Angels 72.
MAJOR ANDERSON
Roger that.
And he throws the throttle forward,
SMASH CUT TO:
Anderson's gloved hand reaches for the CAMERA HEATER
switches.
Anderson double checks his position, switches to the
autopilot for the stability only the machine can provide,
then hits the CAMERA ACTIVATE button on his joystick.
BAMABMABMABMA... The camera begins its photography.
Anderson watches the number on the film-remaining counter
spool down.
He stares out the window.
The towering clouds
below rise up magnificent, glorious... a glimpse of heaven.
Rapt,
Anderson stares.
And then suddenly a BLARING ALARM
GOES OFF IN THE COCKPIT.
It shocks Anderson around to the
controls.
It's his MISSILE WARNING LIGHT.
Anderson' hands flash out to the joystick, turning off the
cameras, disabling autopilot.
He banks the U-2 hard.
The cockpit is a cacophony of alarms and lights, the horizon
outside tilted.
Anderson's breath comes fast, rasping as he
does his strains going into the high-g turn.
He looks out the cockpit window, finds the first SA-2 missile
in pursuit only several thousand feet below him now.
He
waits. Waits.
Waits, still in the turn.
The black head of
the missile now visible.
He puts the plane over, rolling out into an opposite bank.
Anderson's breath comes faster and faster as the second
missile rises up, now visible.
He puts the throttle as far
as it goes, trying to outrun death.
Every second is a tenth
of a mile, and every mile shortens the missile's life span.
The rising missile drafts aft, closing on the U-2 from
behind.
Anderson glances out the window, sees the spent missiles fall
away, and spots the third missile still seeking him aft.
Hand pinning the throttle forward, he prays under his breath.
Major Anderson opens his eyes.
He stares out the window at
the glorious wonder of cloud and sea and earth below.
Kenny, jogging down the hall, hears form an open door.
BUNDY (O.S.)
Kenny!
Kenny goes over to the threshold.
Inside the office Bundy
stands up from behind his desk, grave.
And Kenny knows.
All of EXCOM is there except for Bundy.
Kenny sits behind
the President, deeply distraught over Major Anderson.
THE PRESIDENT
Does this attack on our plane represent
a definitive, intentional escalation on
the part of the Soviets?
GENERAL TAYLOR
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs.
It's hard to believe with their
centralized command structure that it
could be an accidental launch.
MCCONE
Mr. President, taken with the events of
the past few hours, I believe this
confirms our worst fears.
We're now
dealing with a hard-line Soviet
government, perhaps with Khruschev as a
puppet head, perhaps not.
In the silence, Kenny reads the faces around the room.
They're convinced by McCone's pronouncement.
Kenny's not.
KENNY
It could be a mistake.
McCone gives him a get-serious look.
But Kenny presses on.
KENNY (CONT'D)
We need to be positive before we react.
Bundy enters the room.
Everyone looks up.
He stands there
in the doorway, his face tight.
Kenny sags in his chair.
Bundy, of course, has more bad
news, and they all know it.
A hopeless beat.
The President
just stares at Bundy, unable to ask.
Bundy nods, affirming
what everyone is thinking.
BUNDY
A U-2 on a routine air-sampling mission
over Siberia got lost and penetrated
Soviet airspace.
The Soviets scrambled
MIGs in pursuit, thinking it was a
bomber.
It got out okay.
Somebody
forgot to cancel the mission.
THE PRESIDENT
Goddammitt.
There's always some
sonofabitch who doesn't get the word.
All we need is the Soviets thinking
we're bombing them.
(facetious)
Anybody else?
The humor falls on a cold audience.
GENERAL TAYLOR
Mr. President, our pilots are in danger.
We must order punitive airstrikes
against the SAM site that shot down
Major Anderson per our rules of
engagement.
And finally the moment Kenny has dreaded all this time has
come to pass.
He looks at Bobby, then at the President.
The
President stares at the cup of coffee in his hands, as if
trying to read the Fates' design in it.
A long beat, and
everyone holds their breath.
THE PRESIDENT
No.
I want confirmation there wasn't
some sort of accident first.
LeMay clears his throat.
Everyone looks at him, expecting
him to scream or jump up and down.
LEMAY
I think that's a good idea, Mr.
President.
It'll be safer for my boys
to get those SAMs on Monday when we get
the rest of the bastards.
I can wait a
day and a half.
THE PRESIDENT
Very well, then.
But he says it without any belief in the words, realizing
they're being tied fast to the train tracks of war.
Alone in his office, shattered, Kenny stares out the window,
viewing the distant Ellipse through a gap in the trees.
Kids
are out there playing football.
He glances at his watch, and
grabs his jacket.
Kenny enters from his office, finding Bobby, Rusk and
Sorensen talking with the President.
The President gives him
a brief, meaningful look.
RUSK
Whatever response we send, it will take
several hours for the wire to be
received by our embassy and delivered to
the Kremlin.
So we're looking at early
tomorrow morning at the earliest before
Khruschev could respond.
As Rusk talks, Kenny passes close by Bobby.
Bobby whispers:
BOBBY
He gets it, but he's pissed.
THE PRESIDENT
That's all well and good, but what do we
say to 'em?
SORENSEN
It depends on if we really believe
there's been a coup.
That strikes a cord with Kenny.
KENNY
I agree.
If there has been a coup, and
there's a hard-line government in power
now, then it doesn't matter what we say.
The end of the day we'll either agree to
their terms, they'll agree to ours, or
we'll go to war.
But what if there
hasn't been a coup?
What if... what if
what is happening is a series of
accidents?
SORENSEN
The second letter is an accident?
KENNY
No.
The letter is an intentional, but
it's having an effect far greater than
its authors intended.
(beat)
What if our Jupiter missiles are just a
last minute haggle to salvage something?
Maybe a bone Khruschev is throwing to
the hard line, not really caring if we
reject it or not?
(beat)
And then these accidents have happened.
BOBBY
Making the second letter and the overall
picture look worse than it really is.
SORENSEN
The Guns of August.
KENNY
Exactly.
(beat)
If they're sane and human like we are,
then maybe we just refuse, and they'll
let it slide, like we've been letting
things slide.
SORENSEN
So we reject the second letter.
And Kenny looks at Bobby.
The world stops.
KENNY
No.
We don't reject it...
It hits Bobby like a lightning bolt.
BOBBY
... We accept the first letter and
pretend the second doesn't exist.
The President, Rusk and Sorensen stare at him, mute.
HOLD ON the exact same mute reaction from the entire
assembled EXCOM.
Finally McCone breaks the spell.
MCCONE
It won't work --
Bobby, Kenny and Sorensen start to object, but McCone raises
his voice over theirs.
MCCONE (CONT'D)
-- because it's wishful thinking!
It's
the same wishful thinking that blinded
us all these months while the Soviets
were sneaking those missiles in under
our noses!
McNamara shakes his head, intrigued but skeptical.
MCNAMARA
Ignore the second letter, agree to the
conditions of the first...
GENERAL TAYLOR
There's no reason to believe the Soviets
will let it go.
RUSK
Max is right.
Why will they accept it?
MCNAMARA
It can work.
If, IF they believe we'll
hit them.
Kenny, Bobby and Sorensen look at McNamara, grateful.
MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
We've only got time for one more round
of diplomacy.
The first airstrikes
start in less than 36 hours.
RUSK
But we have to make them agree to it.
So how do we do that?
The President leans forward.
Sensing he's about to speak,
all eyes turn to him.
THE PRESIDENT
We give them something.
We tell them
we'll remove the missiles from Turkey
say, six months from now so that there
appears to be no linkage.
We also tell
them if they go public about it, we deny
it and the deal is off.
KENNY
And we do it under the table so we can
disavow any knowledge of it.
MCCONE
It's transparent.
The press'll be all
over it.
KENNY
Six months from now, I'm not going to
care.
Are you?
We'll deal with it.
MCNAMARA
At least it will expose whether
Khruschev has been overthrown.
We'll
know what we're dealing with.
KENNY
And if this is a move to appease the
hard line, then it may just be the bone
he needs to regain control of his own
house.
Most EXCOM is nodding, agreeing.
McCone shakes his head in
disgust.
Taylor sits in silence.
RUSK
Whoever carries the message has to hit
the nail on the head.
Come across as
too soft, they'll push us.
Too hard,
they'll be cornered and even more
dangerous.
MCCONE
They could pre-empt.
It's a terrible responsibility to bear.
The room is silent.
At last Bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother.
The President stares back.
There is nobody else who can do
this.
Only Bobby. His brother.
THE PRESIDENT
Bobby.
You know Dobrynin best.
Bobby nods, taking up the gauntlet.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
Ted, you get working on the draft.
Sorensen and Bobby rise as one, head for the doors.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
And make sure he knows we have to have
an answer tomorrow.
(beat, final)
Because on Monday we begin military
action against Cuba.
Bobby and Kenny exchange a look.
Bobby recovers, opens his own door, gets in the front seat
next to Kenny.
KENNY
Jesus, you rich people.
Kenny starts up the engine.
Bobby smiles a twisted smile.
As the car pulls away, the two men sit in silence, neither
willing to admit how glad the other is there.
Bobby stares out the window at the passing city, the lights
the lives behind those windows.
As the car drives on and on,
the tension returns.
Bobby feels the weight of all those
lives.
On him.
A long beat.
He gazes at Kenny, the only
man he could ever admit this to:
BOBBY
I don't know if I can do this.
Kenny glances over at him.
Bobby stares back.
KENNY
There's nobody else I'd rather have
going in there.
Bobby looks at him.
KENNY (CONT'D)
Nobody else I'd trust Helen and the
kids' lives to.
Kenny means it.
He looks away.
Bobby shifts, awkward.
BOBBY
Take a left.
Kenny looks him.
This isn't the way to the Justice
Department.
But he complies.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
We gave so much to get here.
I don't
know.
Sometimes I think what the hell
did we do it for?
KENNY
Because we knew we could do a better job
than everyone else.
And Bobby, in the silence and closeness of the car, turns on
Kenny - anguished, knowing his life is at its climax.
BOBBY
You know... I hate being called the
brilliant one.
The ruthless one.
They
guy who does the dirty work.
The one
everybody's afraid of.
Kenny looks to him, moved, not knowing what to say.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
I hate it.
I'm not smart, you know.
And I'm not so ruthless.
He looks to Kenny, searching his face, then away,
embarrassed.
KENNY
You're right about the smart part, but
ruthless, well...
That breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene:
THROUGH THE WINDOW
Appears the grim, square lines of the SOVIET EMBASSY.
Police
cars line the streets outside it.
All the windows are dark.
A cordon of KGB GUARDS in plainclothes stand by the gated
entrance.
On the opposite side of the street lounge two
dozen WASHINGTON D.C. POLICE.
RESUME
Kenny gives Bobby a look.
Bobby rolls down his window.
BOBBY
Slow down.
Smell that?
KENNY
Smoke.
BOBBY
Just wanted to see for myself.
(beat)
They're burning their documents.
The final duty of an embassy before war...
BOBBY (CONT'D)
They think we're going to war.
G-d help
us, Ken.
Bobby's STAFFERS greet them as they stride down the hall,
Staffer #1 taking Bobby's coat.
STAFFER #1
Sir, Ambassador Dobrynin is already
here.
We have him waiting in your
office.
They reach the double oak doors to Bobby's suite and stop.
Bobby faces Kenny.
KENNY
I'll whistle up some luck for you.
And before Kenny's eyes, all of Bobby's doubt vanishes.
In
its place, a severe confidence.
A grandeur Kenny has never
seen.
It makes Kenny pause.
He beholds his best friend become a
man of the ages.
And then Bobby SMOOTHLY opens the door.
And a DOOR SHUTS OC like a threshold of history.
HOLD ON
Bobby's waiting room.
Silent.
Cavernous.
Dim.
Plush
carpet.
Heavy drapes framing dark windows.
And abandoned
secretary's desk.
A row of sofas and chairs on either side
of the room.
Two doorways, one at either end of the room.
A WOMAN sits in one of the chairs for visitors.
Dressed in
gray.
Prim.
But beautiful.
A secretary of some sort.
One of the double doors to the hall swings silently open.
Kenny glides in.
He sees the other door shut at the far end
of the room.
Kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait.
HOLD ON THE SCENE, motionless, silent.
Kenny WHISTLES two notes.
Stops.
And then he begins to
WHISTLE the Irish tune, O'Donnell Aboo.
He gets a bar into
it -- and there's a polite, soft COUGH.
Kenny stops.
Then notices the Woman in gray across the room.
He didn't see her.
It's dim over there.
She looks at him,
expressionless.
The CAMERA FINDS: a pin on her lapel.
A RED HAMMER AND
SICKLE.
Kenny reacts.
Dobrynin's assistant?
His opposite number?
A
friend?
Or more than a friend?
Here is the face of the enemy.
Not a smile between them.
Kenny resumes his ease.
And begins to WHISTLE again.
The haunting Irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling,
filling the dim room.
Strange, sad, beautiful.
The woman
listens.
And her face begins to soften.
Kenny stares at the dark, lonely windows, his SONG striving
to fill the empty room.
Kenny sinks deeper in the chair, his tune all-consuming...
and the Woman's voice breaks in.
Kenny stops, looks over.
Her voice is tremulous and beautiful.
Just a snatch of some
song in Russian.
She stops, awkward.
Kenny stares.
The Woman stares back.
No smiles.
But in
their eyes, they each see the other's fear, the other's
beauty, the other's humanity.
So this is the enemy.
THE WOMAN
Who are you?
Kenny glances to the door.
He considers for a long moment.
KENNY
The friend.
Kenny breaks the gaze.
He begins to whistle again.
The
CAMERA drifts away, finding the far DOOR to the inner office,
Kenny's tune stronger, carrying with it hope...
... to the other side of that DOOR.
Dobrynin sits in a chair
opposite Bobby behind his desk.
The room is equally dim.
And far more tense.
Silence.
And then the FAINTEST STRAIN of O'Donnell Aboo.
Dobrynin glances briefly over his shoulder at the door.
But Bobby, unseen by Dobrynin, can't help the flicker of a
private smile.
It's Kenny's presence, and Bobby is the
stronger for it.
And then the tune is gone.
Bobby leans forward, cool, controlled, masterful.
BOBBY
Ambassador Dobrynin, we are aware that
at this moment your missiles in Cuba are
at the brink of operational readiness...
SMASH CUT TO:
Dobrynin listens impassively, as is his professional duty.
BOBBY
My brother, my friends, my countrymen
and I cannot and will not permit those
missiles to become operational.
(beat)
I promise you that.
Dobrynin looks out the window.
And then, pained, looks back
at Bobby.
DOBRYNIN
Then I fear our two nations will go to
war.
And I fear where war will lead us.
Bobby acknowledges him with a nod.
BOBBY
If the missiles do not become
operational, if you remove the missiles,
then there will be no war.
(beat)
At this moment, the President is
accepting the terms of Secretary
Khruschev's letter of Friday night.
If
the Soviet Union halts construction
immediately, removes the missiles, and
submits to U.N. inspection, the United
States will pledge to never invade Cuba
or aid others in that enterprise.
Dobrynin stares at Bobby.
Stares hard.
DOBRYNIN
If your Jupiter missiles in Turkey were
removed also, such an accommodation
could be reached.
The two men move their argument forward with the deliberation
and formality of chess masters.
BOBBY
(tired sounding)
The United States cannot agree to such
terms under threat.
Any belief to the
contrary --
(beat)
-- was in error.
Dobrynin reels internally.
The only sign on his face is a
slight tremor.
Bobby looks up, registers the calculated
effect.
And to Dobrynin's horror, the Russian believes:
DOBRYNIN
You want war...
But not so fast.
Bobby folds his hands.
And he smoothly
goes from hard-ass brinksman to sensitive deal-maker.
BOBBY
However, while there can be no quid pro
quo on this issue, the United States can
offer a private assurance.
Dobrynin holds his breath.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Our Jupiter missiles in Turkey are
obsolete, and have been scheduled for
withdrawal for some time.
This
withdrawal should be completed within,
say, six months.
Dobrynin lets out his breath.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Of course, any public disclosure of this
assurance would negate the deal and
produce the most stringent denials from
our government.
Dobrynin grasps the move immediately, understanding the
ramifications.
Still he hesitates a moment.
DOBRYNIN
This private assurance represents the
word of the Highest Authority?
BOBBY
Yes.
DOBRYNIN
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade
Khruschev's ears to the top circles of
my government
BOBBY
Of course.
Our pledge can be relayed to
any government official Secretary
Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
Meaning this is the bone he can show the hard line.
Dobrynin
struggles internally, knowing what Bobby has done, wanting to
hug him.
It comes across as agitation.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
With the caveat that it is not made
public in any way, shape or form.
(beat)
And we must have an answer tomorrow at
the latest.
I cannot stress this point
enough.
DOBRYNIN
Tomorrow...
BOBBY
Tomorrow...
Dobrynin rises from his chair.
Bobby rises with him.
DOBRYNIN
Then you must excuse me and permit me to
relay the substance of our discussion to
my superiors.
Dobrynin heads for the door.
Half way there he turns back to
Bobby, deeply moved.
Deeply grateful.
DOBRYNIN (CONT'D)
We have heard stories that some among
your military men wish for war.
(beat)
You are a good man.
Your brother is a
good man.
I assure you there are other
good men.
Let us hope the will of good
men is enough to counter the terrible
strength of this thing which has been
put in motion.
Kenny enters the Oval Office through his side door.
The
office is dark, only the desk lamp on.
Kenny's gaze moves
over the trappings of power: the carpet with the Presidential
Seal, the rocking chair by the fireplace, the desk.
And on the desk, tucked almost out of sight, sits a small,
humble wooden plaque.
It's turned to face the occupant of
the chair behind the desk.
Kenny reaches out, turns it
around.
It is the Breton's Fisherman's Prayer.
It reads: OH LORD, THY SEA IS GREAT, MY BOAT SO SMALL.
BOBBY (O.S.)
We're out here.
Kenny holds on the plaque a beat, and looks up at the open
French door to the Rose Garden.
The curtains swirl around
him in the wind as he goes through the door and out --
Helen stands in the kitchen, a ghostly white figure in her
robe, the windows open and curtain flapping as she breathes
the air.
Kenny enters.
He stands in the doorway.
HELEN
I saw you out there.
You want him to
call you back, need you.
KENNY
No.
I'm glad I'm home.
And she knows the worst.
HELEN
How long do we have?
Kenny's voice breaks.
KENNY
If the sun rises in the morning, it is
only because of men of goodwill.
(beat)
And that's all there is between us and
the Devil.
They take each other in their arms, the wisdom of the atomic
age so simple, so tenuous, every human life hanging by such a
thread... yet a thread so powerful.
The CAMERA RISES FROM
THEM, finding the OPEN WINDOW and the DARKNESS.
The RED DOME OF NUCLEAR FIRE rising over Washington.
It
roils the air in its expanding, blood-red glory.
It is the sun.
The dawn in the East.
PULL BACK THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW.
SUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 28TH.
DAY 13
into Kenny and Helen's bedroom.
And silence.
Kenny and
Helen lie together on the bed.
The light burns into Kenny's
half-shut eye.
Kenny is only dimly conscious of the light's
meaning.
Until the PHONE SHRILLS downstairs.
Kenny is instantly up, launched out of the room.
Kenny snatches the RED PHONE from its hook.
KENNY
Yeah?
BOBBY (O.S.)
Kenny.
It's over.
EXCOM laughing, celebrating, half-drunk already this Sunday
morning.
The President shushes the group.
THE PRESIDENT
Hey!
Hey.
Okay, that's enough.
The group quiets down.
The Presidents stares at them, calm,
firm.
They sober up quickly.
Kenny listens, expectant.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
I don't want any gloating.
This is not
a victory over the Soviets.
It's a
victory with the Soviets.
(beat)
I want everyone to remember that.
Kenny rounds a corner.
McNamara, Bundy and McCone are
talking, excited, hushed, standing to one side, down the
hall.
Kenny eyes them as he draws closer, and then they
notice he's approaching.
Bundy nods him over, confidential.
BUNDY
We've been talking.
We can play this
big in '64.
It's the foreign policy
trophy we've been waiting.
Kenny sickens.
He tries to listen, but it all begins to
blur.
BUNDY (CONT'D)
I think we can ride it all the way home
next election.
Bet you're way ahead of
us, eh?
Bundy slaps Kenny on the back.
Kenny is pale.
Is what
they're saying possible?
But Bundy and McCone are too
wrapped up in their schemes to notice Kenny's distress.
MCCONE
We've ordered crash reassessment of our
major geopolitical hotspots.
We've got
a lot of new clout, and we can run the
table on the Soviets.
Middle East,
Southeast Asia...
And Kenny, sad, moved beyond all pity and loathing, realizes
it is possible.
They haven't gotten it.
He is speechless,
helplessly shaking his head.
Bundy finally sees something
isn't right with him.
MCNAMARA
What's wrong, O'Donnell?
Kenny can't speak.
Can't find the words.
But tongue-tied
finally manages:
KENNY
Don't you understand?
McNamara and Bundy look at him funny.
BUNDY
Understand what?
Kenny just looks at them, eyes filled with sorrow.
They
begin to feel uncomfortable.
KENNY
The sun came up today.
BUNDY
Yeah.
KENNY
It shouldn't have.
But it did.
MCCONE
We were lucky we were able to keep it
under control.
Kenny looks away, unable to bear it.
KENNY
Every day the sun comes up... says
something about us.
BUNDY
Says what, Kenny?
Kenny looks back at them.
KENNY
Something... amazing.
They just stare at him.
And with secret smiles, superior
smiles, they nod.
MCNAMARA
Sure, Ken.
I understand.
Feels good to
win, doesn't it?
But they don't understand, and together turn away.
BUNDY
See you later, Kenny.
Kenny watches them, heads bowed in discussion, disappear into
the labyrinth of the West Wing.
Kenny turns his back on
them.
The President stands at his mirror, tying a bow tie to a tux
for some Sunday special event.
Kenny gathers up his folder
from nearby breakfast table.
Kenny meets the President's gaze in the mirror, and the two
men know they have been to the same mountaintop.
THE PRESIDENT
Kenny...
A beat.
Kenny stands straight, ready for action, ready for
some necessary thing.
Ready to go back into the game.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
...never mind.
See you around, Kenny.
Kenny starts to leave, but at the door, turns back.
KENNY
You know...
The President looks at him in the mirror.
KENNY (CONT'D)
...this was what we're here for.
The President smiles an ever-so-faint smile.
Kenny turns and
leaves the room, vanishing, and as we HOLD on the empty
doorway, the simple, whistled melody of O'DONNELL ABOO drifts
from the hallway beyond, becoming our END MUSIC.
FADE OUT
SUPER:
Shortly after the crisis President Kennedy ordered a
reassessment of U.S.-Soviet relations, ushering a brief thaw
in the Cold War.
During this time, the Washington-Moscow
hotline was installed to ensure that in a future crisis,
miscommunication would not lead to nuclear war.
The President was assassinated on November 22nd, a year after
the crisis ended.
THE SUPER:
Bobby Kennedy ran for president in 1968.
After winning the
California primary, he called Kenny from the Ambassador Hotel
in Los Angeles and told him, "I finally feel like I'm out
from under my brother's shadow."
Bobby was assassinated minutes later.
THEN SUPER:
The members of EXCOM continued
to serve with distinction in
government in various capacities over the next three decades.
As Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara
urged containment of the Soviet threat in every theatre of
conflict around the world.
He ultimately advised President
Johnson to increase the U.S. military commitment to one of
these minor backwater conflicts: Vietnam.
AND FINALLY SUPER:
Kenny O'Donnell witnessed the President's assassination from
the car behind.
He went on to head the Peace Platform at the
1968 Democratic National
Convention, fighting to end the
Vietnam War.
