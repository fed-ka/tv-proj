She swings on a WIRE across to another roof, quickly
disappearing into shadows.
Bond can hear sirens approaching. He returns to...
THE OFFICE...he grabs the money and moves fast for the door,
casually slipping that cigar into his pocket...
Except Henchman #1 has recovered, blocks his way, gun in
hand.
He starts to squeeze the trigger -- when a RED DOT
appears on his chest...another window SHATTERS as a bullet
zings through and pierces the henchman in the heart.
Bond looks back once at the shattered window, then heads out.
Lunchtime.
Faceless business crowds heading for their brief
moment of freedom, among them we spot BOND...one of them,
with a briefcase and a suit and tie...HOLD on his face,
troubled.
A SEAPLANE swoops over the Millennium Dome, banks along the
snaking river.
Tate Gallery in background, the seaplane moors beneath the
vast stepped cake that is MI-6.
Bond exits with the
suitcase.
The building rocks.
SMOKE is pouring from a HOLE that's
appeared in a lower tier. A wall and a section of roof gone.
A figure staggers out, shaken.
Catching his breath.
BOND.
CUT TO:
ECU CIGAR GIRL
Lining up Bond with her infra-red telescopic sight.
ANGLE ON BOND
In the swirling dust and smoke, he suddenly sees a wand of
red light, pointing at his chest.
All instinct, he dives for cover.
Powerful, high velocity
bullet hits blanket the area.
Bond prepares to return fire,
scanning around for the source. Through the debris he spots
an unusual, hi-tech BOAT on the river -- long and narrow and
low.
A figure on board.
THE CIGAR GIRL.
ANGLE ON CIGAR GIRL
She FIRES OFF A ROUND OF SHOTS, forcing Bond back into cover.
Then she guns the engines and SPEEDS OFF down the Thames.
Determined, Bond races back into the wreckage...
THE 007 THEME KICKS IN AS:
JAMES BOND, in the Q boat, SHOOTS OUT of the MI-6 rubble and
onto the Thames.
Bond can see the Cigar Girl up ahead...he is closing the
distance.
She catches sight of him in pursuit...
She pushes the boat to its limit, it roars to a new level of
speed...the chase is on.
Police speedboats, alerted by the commotion, trail Bond.
ON THE EMBANKMENT
Police cars scream alongside, sirens wailing.
ON THE THAMES
Bond is losing ground as he and the Cigar Girl weave through
traffic on the Thames. In a gutsy bid to keep pace, he
corrals the Q boat into a hair-raising SHORT-CUT, shooting
off...
UNDERNEATH A PIER
He maneuvers the boat under the low pier and emerges EVEN
CLOSER to his prey...
The Cigar Girl stops her boat, moving to the back, manning
her large, rear-mountain MACHINE GUN and taking aim at
Bond...
Bond continues at full speed, fearless in the hail of bullets
ricocheting off the vessel.
THE CIGAR GIRL Remains calm and cool, shooting with
precision.
BOND closes in...
CIGAR GIRL'S eyes widen as...
BOND STEERS HIS BOAT RIGHT OVER THE MACHINE GUN AND TURRET...
Cigar Girl dives out of the way, as her boat becomes a RAMP,
LAUNCHING the Q boat INTO THE AIR before it dives, nose-
first, into the Thames.
CIGAR GIRL gets up from the deck and sees BOND, turning his
boat to close in for the kill...
She scrambles to the helm and SPEEDS OFF, seeing ahead of
her...
TOWER BRIDGE
Just beginning to open, to allow for passage of a small
tanker.
She streaks toward the bridge, Bond lagging behind...
ON BOND
As he looses her boat in the distance, he makes a DESPERATE
MOVE...he cranks the wheel of his boat and veers off, UP A
SLIPWAY and into...
Where the boat hydroplanes on masses of surface water and
propels him into
The hurtling boat causes mayhem and panic as he wrestles with
the controls, jetting off the street and straight toward...
Bond's boat crashes right through it, sending diners LEAPING
in every direction. The Q boat SHOOTS OUT over the balcony
and splashes down once more into...
Cigar Girl is now clearly in his sights.
She is amazed to
see that Bond has managed to overtake her.
The racing boats dice through an armada of lazy, over-loaded
BARGES, nearly crashing into the much larger vessels.
AT EVEN PACE NOW...Cigar Girl attempts to force her way past
him, but Bond, punching buttons on the console of the Q-boat,
releases a set of catapulting FLAME CANNISTERS which create a
massive WALL OF FIRE ahead of them...
CIGAR GIRL is forced toward the very edge of the river...the
jig is almost up, and then...
HER P.O.V.
She spots the launching of a HOT AIR BALLOON from
the base of the massive MILLENNIUM DOME.
She skids her vessel to a stop at a nearby pier and quickly
scrambles out of her boat.
...A crowd around a RICHARD BRANSON-like figure about to
climb into his HOT AIR BALLOON.
The Cigar Girl, brandishing her gun, forces her way through
the crowd and LEAPS INTO THE BALLOON CARRIAGE, just ready to
lift off.
She cranks open the gas nozzles and the balloon
rises with surprising speed.
Bond steers his craft toward a slipway adjacent to the pier
and SHOOTS UP INTO THE AIR...
An amazing sight...Bond's boat sailing through the air just
beneath the balloon.
With split second precision he reaches
up and GRABS ONE OF THE ROPES dangling down from the balloon.
Bond finds himself being CARRIED THROUGH THE AIR as his boat
falls away from him, hitting the ground and ERUPTING into a
ball of flame.
As Bond is carried higher and higher, the Cigar Girl begins
FIRING AT HIM over the edge of the carriage.
Bond, with ONE HAND, returns fire.
CIGAR GIRL then leans over the edge of the carriage and
begins to SLICE THE ROPE that Bond is hanging from.
The fibers split and fray away from each other as...
BOND FALLS, heading straight toward...
THE MILLENNIUM DOME, which the balloon has drifted over.
AS HE PLUMMETS DOWNWARD...Bond, never surrendering, still
FIRES HIS WEAPON up at the balloon. A bullet hits the gas
tank...
The BALLOON EXPLODES IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL taking the Cigar
Girl with it...
Bond lands with a spectacular thudding bounce, the roof of
the Millennium Dome breaking his fall.
He slides uncontrollably down the slope of the Dome as scraps
of burning balloon rain down all around, before he FALLS OFF
THE EDGE of the Dome and lands with a THUD ON...
THE GROUND BELOW
He struggles up, wincing in SEARING PAIN as his hand goes to
his INJURED SHOULDER. He hold it, and looks up, into the sky
as we zero in on the iris of...
HIS EYE
reflecting the massive smoke cloud from the explosion as the
screen transforms into...
THE MAIN TITLES
CUT TO:
BAGPIPES.
A chapel atop a green slope overlooking the waters
of Loch Lomond.
A long line of mourners files out at the end of a memorial
service.
They mill about on the lawn, among them,
M, grim-
faced, BILL TANNER, CHIEF OF STAFF and JAMES BOND, his arm in
a black sling.
Bond, ever vigilant, scans the crowd...
HIS P.O.V.
It's like a state funeral.
Rich and powerful
people, government ministers, chief executives from around
the world...and then...
FAR OFF, on a DISTANT RISE, he sees a BIG MAN, not one of the
mourners but an isolated observer, standing alone, wearing
sunglasses and a military haircut.
The man seems to see Bond looking at him...
M
Bond, we'll meet you inside.
Bond looks at her for a brief second...when he turns back,
the man is gone, like an APPARITION.
Bond walks off, up the grassy slope, toward the rise.
CUT TO:
THE VIEW ACROSS THE VALLEY
Bond stands on the hill, looking below.
He sees nothing but
a green carpet, not a tree to hide behind.
He hears a crunch of leaves...turns...
HIS P.O.V.
A WOMAN, in mourning black, coming up the hill.
Her china doll face is both fragile and proud.
WOMAN
Beautiful, isn't it?
BOND
Yes.
She steps up to the ridge with him.
A breeze blows her hair.
They stare out. The sun's rays have broken the clouds and
strafe the valley.
WOMAN
Today, of all days, the sun decides to
shine.
BOND
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the
Man Upstairs.
WOMAN
A word? I'm sure by now he's engineered a
hostile takeover.
BOND
You knew him well?
The sun glints off her bejewelled earlobe.
WOMAN
He was my father.
BOND
I'm sorry.
WOMAN
He died before he could complete his
lifelong dream.
(beat)
I intend to finish it for him.
A voice interrupts them, calling from the estate...
OLDER MAN
Elektra!
ELEKTRA
Excuse me.
She walks away, the wind pressing her dress against her
delicate figure.
She looks brave and vulnerable as she walks
back toward her father's grand house.
CUT TO:
The limousine swoops under the portcullis, into a courtyard.
ADJUST ANGLE to reveal huge antennae and satellite dishes
within.
SUPER:
MI-6 REMOTE OPERATIONS CENTRE, SCOTLAND
Bond walks through the corridors.
Just before he enters the
medical room, he removes his sling and casually drapes it on
a suit of armor.
A hot day. CAMERA soars over tall trees. We can just make out
the sleek muscular car, beetle-black and far below, bouncing
over rough terrain.
Bond "taking care" of his new BMW Z7.
MOUNTAINS - DAY
Bond reaches a PERIMETER FENCE, manned by a GUARD.
The guard
examines Bond's PASS and waves him through.
MOUNTAINS - DAY (OLD SC. 69)
As Bond drives on he passes an area where HELICOPTERS
trailing GIANT SAWS are trimming back trees.
Felled trees
are being dragged away, being replaced by huge metal sheets.
An incredibly fast and well-oiled operation -- but why?
Bond pulls up at the CONSTRUCTION SITE, teeming with ultra-
modern robotic construction machines and vehicles.
He gets out, and is immediately surrounded by men with guns.
A man in a suit steps forward.
DAVIDOV is tall, blonde, with
a dangerous charm Bond instantly recognizes as ex-KGB.
He turns Bond around, hands on the car.
Pats him down.
Pulls out an ID, checks it:
DAVIDOV
(excellent English)
Bond. A government man. I'm afraid since
you English got the boss killed we've
been a little...jumpy.
Bond stares ahead, watches a PRIVATE JET swoops past...
OMITTED
MOUNTAINS - DAY
The jet lands on a runway of the metal sheets Bond saw being
laid as he passed...
Davidov pulls out Bond's gun.
BOND
(re:
gun)
I'd rather you didn't play with that.
Davidov ignores him, looking the gun over.
DAVIDOV
Nice.
BOND
Quite stunning.
Bond turns to watch a LIFTING HELICOPTER swoop in and drop
down an air-conditioned office.
Military precision.
Davidov's radio crackles out a message and he tosses the gun
back to Bond.
They start walking:
DAVIDOV
(pleasant)
Sorry about all that, comrade. Old habits
die hard. I am Head of Security.
Davidov.
Bond eyes him, but is distracted by a jet coming to a halt
ahead of them.
Stairs swing down and out steps ELEKTRA KING.
Beautiful,
elegant.
So out of place in this world of men.
She surveys
the worksite.
Impressed, Bond takes his ID back from Davidov.
BOND
The killer doesn't want to see this
pipeline continue, doesn't want to see
you take over...
ELEKTRA
That's every man within a five mile
radius.
Including you.
(off his look)
That's why you're here, isn't it? You
think I can't do it. You think I'm going
to screw up. Or get myself killed.
BOND
I think running this pipeline would be a
difficult job for anyone. Especially
King's daughter.
ELEKTRA
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am
the only person who can do it.
CUT TO:
Elektra drives the all-terrain jeep with casual assurance.
Bond is beside her, cold-weather gear in the back.
They're
following a huge pipeline, passing a blighted petrified
forest of twisted iron:
derelict oil derricks.
Elektra gestures at the oil fields they're now leaving
behind.
Receding into the distance, a DELTA OF ROADWAYS
perched on rusting stilts juts out into the sea.
ELEKTRA
My mother's people discovered oil here
ninety years ago.
The Bolsheviks
slaughtered them for it.
(beat)
Some say oil is in my family's blood.
I
say our blood is in the oil. This is the
very heart of the planet.
Up here in the
hills was Eden, literally.
Look what the
Russians did to it.
Now we have a second
chance and this time we'll do it right.
When the other wells have all dried up,
she'll still be pumping her lifeblood to
the world.
And this
(proudly, of pipeline)
Will be one of the main arteries...
OMITTED 75-
Bond and Elektra travel beside the vast pipe through
dramatic, beautiful, scenery...
(CAPPADOCIA, THE VILLAGE OF ZELVE) - DAY
The jeep reaches a break in the pipe: a SURVEY CAMP, flags,
strings.
The SURVEY CREW cower behind a 4WD, local tribesman
are stoning them from a village carved into the rock.
A lot
of SHOUTING.
Before Bond can stop her, Elektra gets out, moves toward the
tribesmen.
The stoning ceases. They know who she is.
She
begins to speak quietly -- in their own tongue.
ABOVE:
We hear the click of high-powered electronic binoculars,
zeroing in on Bond and Elektra as they return to the survey
team.
This can't be Davidov's view, as the helicopter has
settled down below.
Bond is edgy.
Someone is out there.
He's sure of it.
He
sees Davidov and Gabor scanning the area as well.
Elektra
speaks to the foreman.
ELEKTRA
Send the pipe around.
FOREMAN
It will take weeks, cost millions.
Your father approved this route.
ELEKTRA
Then my father was wrong.
The first time Elektra has asserted her own authority. The
foreman is surprised, angry. But he doesn't question her.
She moves toward the helicopter, says to Bond:
ELEKTRA
I have to check the upper lines.
Gabor
will drive you back.
BOND
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
ELEKTRA
You don't take no for an answer, do you?
BOND
No.
She shrugs, mischief in her eyes.
ELEKTRA
Alright then. Do you ski?
Bond just smiles.
BOND
I've been known to.
The chopper swoops over SNOWY WASTES.
It reaches a mountain
peak, hovers.
The wind is strong, buffeting.
Elektra and Bond are both now in ski suits, Bond wearing a
sleek black jacket.
PILOT
Can't land.
Wind's too strong!
ELEKTRA
Just hold her steady.
(to Bond)
You wanted to see it.
She steps into her skis, opens the door.
Wind rushes in.
Without a moment's hesitation, Elektra leaps out of the
chopper and falls fifteen feet, landing on the move.
HELICOPTER - DAY
Unbelieving, Bond quickly dons skis and leaps after her.
Below him on the mountain, she is already a way ahead.
Her
skiing is fearless.
Bond likes a challenge...
They wind down the slope, competitive, testing one another,
enjoying it.
After an exhilarating run, she stops on the edge of a huge
drop.
Bond joins her.
They look down at the snowy valley
below.
A line of survey FLAGS visible through the middle.
ELEKTRA
We're building from both ends.
This is
where they'll meet.
Fifteen hundred
miles from the Caspian to the
Mediterranean.
Bond and Elektra stand on the mountainside, feeling like the
only two people in the world, when they hear: THE DISTANT HUM
OF A PLANE.
They see FOUR OBJECTS falling out the back of the aircraft.
As the objects plummet silently toward the earth, they POP
PARACHUTES, their fall slows and then, as Bond and Elektra
watch in disbelief...
GUNFIRE echoes out from the black shapes, now visible as
PARASKIS, low-flying, sleek, deadly snow vehicles.
Bond turns to Elektra, he has to yell over the sound of the
approaching machines.
BOND
Head for that gully, I'll lure them into
the trees!
He points her off to one side, where a shallow gully offers
cover...she skis off to shelter and he skis OUT...INTO THE
OPEN...where the paraskis trail after him...
He streaks toward the trees as the vehicles gain on him,
firing...
He makes it to the woods, finding cover in the trees,
whipping in and out of sight as PARASKI #1 tries to follow,
sinking lower and lower until...
HIS SKIDS catch on some over hanging branches...the Paraski
is CATAPULTED into a tree and EXPLODES...
Coming in to pick up the pursuit of Bond is Paraski #2,
firing down at Bond, dropping bombs which explode just behind
him in the snow.
The other two paraskis LAND and eject their
chutes, now RACING THROUGH THE WOODS on the ground.
Bond looks behind him, sees them gaining...he zigzags through
the trees and suckers Paraski #3 to glance off one tree, hit
another and wipe out behind.
But the remaining predator on the ground, Paraski #4, is
gaining on him...Bond bursts out of the trees and finds
himself heading toward...
THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE...
He cranks himself right, narrowly avoiding a tumble over the
edge.
Paraski #4 isn't so lucky and SAILS OFF THE CLIFF to a
hundred and fifty foot drop.
BOND
(smiling)
Should have stuck to snowboarding.
But the smile is wiped off his face as...AN EMERGENCY
PARACHUTE deploys from the back...
The Paraski does a climbing turn and heads straight back for
him...
Bond skis for his life, away from Paraski #4 when PARASKI #2
appears in front of him...guns blazing...
One ahead and one behind, Bond turns back...he has nowhere to
go but...
OVER THE EDGE
He sails through the air and lands on the Paraski #4,
slashing the parachute with his ski pole before bouncing off
and doing an amazing tumbling hundred foot fall to the snow,
where he lands on his skis... Paraski four, the chute
tangling in the rotors of its propeller, struggles to
maintain control, his vehicle inexorably hurtling toward
PARASKI #2: both of them having set their course for Bond,
they are now on a collision course with EACH OTHER...
IN THE GULLY BELOW
Bond meets up with Elektra as above them...
The two Paraskis collide, crashing into the snowy hill above
and tumbling down, end over end.
Bond and Elektra huddle together as shards and debris rain
down on them.
Then...silence.
An eerie silence.
ELEKTRA
Are they gone? All of them?
Bond nods, ripping from his pole a PIECE OF THE PARACHUTE he
slashed and wiping his face with it...he looks at the piece
of fabric in his hand.
He sees:
CYRILLIC LETTERS...undecipherable to us...but there is a look
on his face, a look of recognition as...
AN EARTH RATTLING RUMBLE grows above them.
Bond stuffs the parachute fragment in his ski-suit as he
turns...
The exploding Paraskis have triggered AN AVALANCHE on the
slope above.
They try to outrun it -- riding the sliding hill -- but they
haven't a hope... the rest of the snow is catching them,
they're going to get swallowed.
The ground shudders, the THUNDER CLOSING...
Their ankles are
soon covered, Elektra falls.
Bond stops, pulls her up.
They're about to die.
He pulls her to him.
BOND
Hold on to me.
She's confused and frightened but does as she's told.
They hold one another tight as -- here it comes -- the white
fury hurtles over them, burying them...
At the last moment,
just as their heads vanish from view...
CLOSE ON BOND PULLING THE Q GADGET ON THE JACKET.
The AIRBAG slams open.
The snow covers it and them.
More
and more snow slides over...
CUT TO:
A beautiful expanse of smooth virgin snow.
All is quiet.
CLOSER
Bond's fist PUNCHES through the white.
He pulls the snow
away, climbs out.
Leans in, lifts Elektra out.
Bond and Elektra stand, lone figures in the perfect white.
They hear a sound...HELICOPTER ROTORS.
Rescue on its way.
CUT TO:
An establishing shot of Bond's BMW parked outside the ornate
villa on the shore of the golden Caspian.
Elegant, mysterious.
A modern day Casablanca.
Bond, Elektra, Gabor outside, Davidov soon joining them,
trying to look like he hasn't been through hell.
Bond
notices the burn on his head. Davidov touches it self-
consciously.
DAVIDOV
A little accident.
BOND
A night of burning passion?
Davidov scowls at him. Bond leads Elektra away...
CUT TO:
A DISTANT P.O.V. FROM HIGH ABOVE.
Someone watches Bond and Elektra move toward his BMW.
HENCHMAN (V.O.)
What about Bond?
RENARD and his henchmen, watching. Renard seems mesmerized by
the sight of Bond's HAND on the small of Elektra's back,
their easy sensuality as they both get into the car.
HENCHMAN
Sir?
Sir?
RENARD
(seething)
I will take care of Mister Bond.
CUT TO:
Bond and Elektra emerge from the BMW.
Behind them, Gabor and
Davidov get out of her car. Bond watches as Davidov slams his
door and marches off, angry, toward the SECURITY QUARTERS at
the side of the house.
Bond and Elektra walk to the front door, anticipation thick
in the air.
Gabor opens the door. Elektra sweeps through...
The lights of a car pulling up at the security office by the
perimeter wall of the property.
Bond's car, several of Elektra's vehicles, all parked around
the security office.
They have been joined by:
A WHITE ECONOMY CAR, a Russian make, with a familiar SEAL
painted on the door...we've seen it before, the seal on top
of the stolen report at the beginning...Miratom.
Out of the driver's seat steps...DAVIDOV.
He carries a
briefcase from the car to the front door of the security
office. He looks around furtively before he disappears
inside.
The parking area is dark and silent and then:
JAMES BOND sits up in the driver's seat of his BMW.
The Russian car drives onto the grounds of a small, deserted
AIRPORT consisting of one outbuilding and a crudely cleared
airstrip.
Davidov's feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and
opens the trunk.
He removes the briefcase.
Then the duffle bag.
He looks
down at the dead body,
head slumped forward, as before...but
something is different, the clothes not quite right and then:
THE DEAD BODY MOVES, the head turns, Davidov gasps...
It IS JAMES BOND.
BOND
Problem, comrade?
Davidov pulls his HAND GUN from inside his coat, but Bond is
quicker.
With a silenced pistol he shoots Davidov in the
head. One little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes
go wide and he crumbles, dead.
Bond climbs out of the trunk.
Crouches to examine Davidov.
BOND
Old habits die hard.
He straightens.
Picks up the briefcase.
It is locked.
He
searches Davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket.
He
opens the lock.
INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE:
FOUR STACKS OF MONEY.
Documents
headed with the official crest of Miratom.
A new security
tag, it looks just like the dead guy's, but has Davidov's
name and picture...some hologrammed (blank) security tags --
and a polaroid-type camera.
He picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the
camera.
Points at himself, takes a shot.
Punches in
'Davidov' on the KEYPAD.
Out comes a brand new pass.
Bond goes to look in the dufflebag but...
A PLANE is approaching...HE LOOKS UP.
HIS P.O.V.
A Russian military jet appears over the trees,
flying low, its red landing lights blinking.
A door opens on the sinister-looking plane.
A hydraulic step
unit folds out of it.
A BIG SOLDIER with a machine gun waits
in the doorway.
BOND, standing at the edge of the runway, clips on his badge
and picks up the briefcase.
He has NO IDEA what he's walking
into.
BOND
Here goes nothing.
He hoists the dufflebag over his shoulder and walks out to
the plane.
He starts up the steps:
THE SOLDIER POINTS HIS GUN DOWN AT HIM. Says something to him
IN RUSSIAN.
Bond pauses.
And then, thinking, says:
BOND
Romashka.
The soldier looks at him, then lowers his weapon.
A red dawn.
Dominating the landscape, a valley of weirdly-
shaped rocks. To one side, an airstrip.
The plane
approaching.
Bond, in the orange overalls and wearing his ID tag, is
driving with a Russian soldier through the weird rock valley -
-
KABOOM!
A cloud of dust from a detonation rises up on the other side
of the hill.
They turn the corner and see trucks marked IDA, several
Kazakhstan army personal carriers, soldiers dotted around,
IDA (International Decommissioning Agency) scientists and
personnel quietly going about their business.
A vast
protective 'bubble' is inflated at the front of the building.
An officer eyes Bond's pass.
COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
(subtitles)
You are late. The transport documents?
Bond shows him the case.
Akakievich examines the documents.
COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
(subtitles)
They are waiting for you below.
It
should be ready. Check with the IDA
physicist.
He points toward the "bubble."
Inside the transparent bubble, a protective-suited FIGURE
finishes placing a blue PLUTONIUM CORE into a box.
As Bond and the Colonel walks toward the bubble, the FIGURE
steps out, still enveloped in the white protective suit.
Moving fast, off comes the helmet to reveal a BEAUTIFUL
AMERICAN GIRL.
CHRISTMAS JONES is mid-twenties, shortish
hair, hot right now.
In one movement she unzips and steps
out of the suit, revealing a khaki sports bra, cut-off
shorts, heavy duty boots.
A nasty-looking hunting knife
strapped around her hips.
She has a deep tan and an
incredible figure.
She grabs a bottle of water, guzzles.
Bond tosses an arched brow to Akakievich, who nods bitterly,
also unable to take his eyes off her.
He spits on the floor
and speaks in ENGLISH, so Christmas can hear.
COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
Not interested in men. Take my word for
it.
Akakievich isn't exactly what you'd call a looker.
Bond
offers a disappointed tut as Akakievich walks away.
Christmas approaches.
He notices her IDA tag -- and an
incongruous PEACE TATTOO just above her hip. She's checking
him out as well.
CHRISTMAS
You new?
BOND
(Russian accent)
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
CHRISTMAS
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones.
No jokes, I've heard them all.
BOND
Don't know any doctor jokes.
She is wary.
It's been a long time since a man this
attractive stepped onto her beat. They walk toward the
building.
CHRISTMAS
What happened to Len Tashka?
BOND
Couldn't make it. Splitting headache.
CHRISTMAS
The soldiers may give you a hard time.
Whatever. If we weren't around, they'd
have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by
the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
Bond looks at the ominous radiation WARNING SIGNS.
BOND
Will I need protection?
She squints at him, taken aback.
CHRISTMAS
There's no radiation danger down there.
Bond turns to go, knowing he misstepped.
Christmas then
speaks to him, asking a question, IN RUSSIAN.
CHRISTMAS
(subtitles)
Where is this stockpile going?
Bond turns, answers IN PERFECT RUSSIAN.
BOND
(subtitles)
To the nuclear facility at Penza 19.
She nods. Watches him disappear into the building.
Christmas and Bond climb out of the duct.
Through a cloud of
dust he can see people running about, panicked.
There's been
some shooting -- fresh corpses litter the ground.
Bond looks past them to a plane coming this way.
The plane.
It roars past, level with them.
He follows it with his eyes,
helpless as it gets smaller and smaller...
CHRISTMAS
They won't get far. Every warhead has a
locator card.
A Miratom device.
Emits a
high-pitched signal on Russian emergency
frequencies. We can track the bomb.
BOND
With this?
Bond removes the locator card from his jacket and shows it to
her.
It flashes in the sun.
Christmas shakes her head, disgusted.
OMITTED 170 - 172
DISSOLVE:
Elektra's villa against blue-black storm clouds, the Caspian
choppy, wind blowing.
The MI-6 chopper lands.
We can see M through the window.
Face set hard.
SCIENTIFIC, MILITARY and TURKISH POLICE VEHICLES parked
around a medium-sized industrial plant.
Bond accompanies M and Tanner toward a clutch of offices.
All around, SOLDIERS, IDA personnel, POLICE scour the area.
M
(to Bond)
Glad to see you've turned up.
He is moving fast, talking fast -- a sense of urgency.
BOND
They hit about 90 minutes ago. There's a
scientist here from the International
Decommissioning Agency, Dr. Jones.
She
has ten crews combing the area.
They step out of the bright sunlight and into
FIVE BODY BAGS are being carried out by soldiers.
M surveys
the scene; in an unlit corridor CHRISTMAS JONES and several
men sweep the area with CLICKING Geiger counters.
ELEKTRA is a distance away, listening to a Turkish policeman
explain what's happening.
She nods acknowledgement to M.
Tanner senses that Bond wants to talk to M alone:
TANNER
I'll see how they're coming with the
power...
They watch him go.
M turns to Bond:
M
You had your hand on the bomb and you let
Renard get away with it.
He draws her away, to a small alcove.
Takes something out of
his jacket...THE LOCATOR CARD.
BOND
The report King bought. It's a manual.
Renard's men used it to remove this radio
tracking device from the warhead.
M
Then Robert was right about a Russian
connection.
BOND
They're getting their weapons from the
Russians, but where are they getting the
money to buy the weapons?
I can't help
thinking...the person close to King, the
one who switched that pin...
M
The inside man?
BOND
Is maybe...the inside woman.
NOW THE LIGHTS POWER UP, disrupt the intimacy and intensity
of their exchange.
The room is lined with MONITORS and a
huge SATELLITE MAP of the pipeline's meandering path.
M
A woman?
But before he can speak, ELEKTRA calls out, gesturing to A
DIM LIGHT flashing on a console in front of her.
ELEKTRA
That's not right.
A Technician comes over.
Tanner too, followed by Bond and M.
TANNER
What is it?
ELEKTRA
It's an observation and repair rig.
Travels along the pipe, checks for broken
seals.
But it's not supposed to be
there.
BOND
(thinks)
Stop it.
The Technician flicks two switches.
The light continues to
flash.
Confused, he tries others.
No change.
TECHNICIAN
I don't understand...
M
Where is the rig?
Harried, the Technician activates the wall schematic of the
pipeline.
A pulse of light travels along the line. And with
it, a sense of horror descends...
M
The parcel's in the post.
TANNER
It's heading for the oil terminal.
M
Where it can do the most damage.
ELEKTRA
My God.
(to one of her men)
Have the terminal evacuated.
The man gets on the phone...
BOND
(to Tech)
Speed?
TECHNICIAN
Full on.
Seventy miles an hour.
He punches buttons. Christmas has come, stands next to Bond.
TECHNICIAN
One hundred and six miles from the
terminal.
BOND
(quick)
It'll reach the other end in seventy-
eight minutes.
(to Tech)
Any more of these rigs?
The Technician checks his records, looks up, nods.
TECHNICIAN
There's one parked in the passageway
ahead of it.
Decisive, Christmas heads for the door, turns to her team:
CHRISTMAS
I'll need some help...
Her IDA colleagues look sheepish.
Bond moves to her.
BOND
Come on.
For just a moment, Christmas looks wary:
BOND
Unless you'd like to see my ID first.
She almost smiles.
M nods to Tanner to follow them.
Bond doesn't look at
Elektra.
But she watches him go...
CUT TO:
The MI-6 helicopter swoops along the pipeline...
Tanner is beside the pilot.
Bond and Christmas in the back.
They look at one another, the danger ahead melting the frost
between them.
The pipeline.
A long beat, then...
KABOOM!!
A section of the pipe explodes, debris rocketing in
every direction.
As the smoke clears we see a fifty yard section of pipe has
been destroyed.
OMIT 223
From on high we follow the snaking pipeline ... until it
disappears in a VAST, SMOULDERING BOMB CRATER.
Beyond, the
pipeline continues unperturbed.
Two TINY FIGURES on the banks of the crater.
CLOSE ON THEM
Bond and Christmas, very much alive.
She's angry.
CHRISTMAS
What the hell were you doing?
You nearly
killed us!
BOND
I did kill us. She thinks we're dead.
And she thinks she got away with it.
CHRISTMAS
What the hell are you talking about?
BOND
It's part of some plan. She dresses it up
like a terrorist attack.
The explosion
covers up the theft of the plutonium.
CHRISTMAS
Who's she?
BOND
Elektra King.
CHRISTMAS
Elektra King?
Are you insane?
This is
her pipeline.
BOND
Makes her look even more innocent.
CHRISTMAS
(skeptical)
What would she want with weapons grade
plutonium?
BOND
I was hoping you could tell me.
Christmas stares at him.
Wheels turning.
CHRISTMAS
You steal an old bomb, small by today's
standards, about the size of the one that
destroyed Nagasaki, take the plutonium
core out of it, intending to use it...
(beat)
To make a bigger, better bomb.
They're both chilled by the thought.
CHRISTMAS
I have to get after that core.
This is
my ass.
She starts fiddling with the radio. Suddenly there's a
CRACKLE.
TANNER
Tanner to 007, do you read?
Bond grabs the radio.
BOND
Loud and clear.
I have to speak to M.
TANNER
She's gone.
BOND
What?
TANNER
She's disappeared.
And two of our men
have been killed.
It impacts on Bond.
His eyes harden.
CHRISTMAS
What is it?
BOND
She just upped the stakes. All her chips
are on the table now.
And M's life is
part of the bet.
He looks out at the long stretch of pipeline, like a deadly
snake with the world for its bed.
BOND
I know I promised you champagne, but
would you settle for caviar?
CUT TO:
A boat puts in at an ancient tower in the middle of a vast
body of water (in fact, the Bosphorus).
Renard disembarks with several of his retinue, heavily laden
with bags and cases.
They enter the tower...
Valentin Zukovsky in the back of his chauffeured Rolls
Royce...
We PULL BACK, to take in an amazing sight:
the car
is on a network of raised walkways and platforms that extends
as far as the eye can see.
A decaying legacy of the Soviet
years.
Zukovsky limps purposefully away from his Rolls along a
walkway leading to a Beluga fishery built over the water.
Bond BURSTS OUT OF THE BUILDING...Zukovsky and his guards and
even the chauffeur are firing at the chopper...
Bond makes for his BMW, running down a flight of steps, onto
a lower walkway when...THE SECTION AHEAD OF HIM
EXPLODES...the second chopper above hitting its mark with a
thrown grenade.
Bond is trapped by the fire and smoke, the
only way out is ALONG THE PIPELINES...he runs along a narrow
section of pipe and then JUMPS DOWN to another walkway.
The
PIPES are now above him...the chopper's relentless saws CUT
THROUGH THE PIPE...GAS JETS OUT...Bond HURLS HIMSELF up a
stairway.
Bond takes something out of his pocket, a remote control
device...he presses some buttons...HIS CAR COMES TO
LIFE...lights on, it drives toward him.
He rushes to meet it. Chopper Two follows behind Bond,
slicing up the walkway just behind him.
Bond gets to the car
and JUMPS IN as the chopper veers away.
A DIRECT HIT. Chopper One explodes and falls onto the walkway
setting the scene ablaze.
Zukovsky and Christmas see the explosion, then see Chopper
Two dropped FOUR ARMED MEN onto a nearby walkway.
The men
make their way toward the factory, firing at the guards.
Zukovsky and Christmas are forced inside.
ANGLE ON BOND
Who sees the danger to the others and runs off along the
walkways back to the factory.
The Chopper follows him,
shooting.
Bond outruns it, until, ahead of him A GRENADE EXPLODES,
destroying the walkway and hurling Bond into the water.
The gunfight continues as the armed men take out Zukovsky's
guards. Then, two of the assailants follow ZUKOVSKY and
CHRISTMAS into...
Zukovsky and Christmas make a dash for Zukovsky's Rolls.
They dive in...Zukovsky rams the car into reverse...behind
him, A CHOPPER SLICES the walkway to smithereens...Zukovsky
can't stop it as the car leaps backward and into THE WATER
BELOW....
Bond sees Zukovsky and Christmas swimming to safety.
The
chopper bears down on him.
He leaps back to what's left of
the building, picks up a flare gun.
He jumps down to a
walkway at water level and cranks open a rusted GAS JET...he
then waits for the Chopper to line up over it as it
approaches Bond for the kill....
Bond fires the flare gun...
THE GAS EXPLODES!
The Chopper tries to pull away, but it's too late.
The
flames engulf it, igniting a fireball.
IN THE WATER
Zukovsky pulls himself back onto a walkway and heads for the
factory, but speeding at him are to FREE-FLYING SAW BLADES
from the chopper that has just exploded!
OMITTED 231S to 231Z
Zukovsky dives away -- into a CAVIAR PIT.
The saws embed in
the cabin behind him.
The caviar pit is like sinking sand, deep -- he's going
under.
Flounders, trying to cling to a crate blown in there
by the explosion.
Then he looks in horror:
POV ZUKOVSKY:
Bond appearing at the edge of the caviar pit, dragging
himself up, soaking wet.
He's holding another harpoon gun.
Points it directly at Zukovsky.
This time he really means
business.
Zukovsky, on the point of being swallowed by the caviar,
clawing at the crate.
Bond, steely eyed, cold:
BOND
Now...where were we?
ZUKOVSKY
A rope!
BOND
No.
The truth!
(beat)
She thought I was dead -- those blades
were meant for you.
What do you know
that she would kill you for?
Zukovsky is sinking.
ZUKOVSKY
I don't know what you're talking --
Zukovsky sees Christmas appear beside Bond:
ZUKOVSKY
Help me, don't let me drown.
She looks to Bond -- sees he's serious.
BOND
(to Zukovsky)
You're in this thing up to your neck.
Zukovsky sinks alarmingly -- he talks rapidly, staccato:
ZUKOVSKY
Alright, alright!
Sometimes I smuggle
machinery for her.
Russian stuff.
BOND
And the payoff on the tables?
ZUKOVSKY
A special job.
A...a...a submarine.
CHRISTMAS
What?
ZUKOVSKY
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is
Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
BOND
Where's the sub going?!
ZUKOVSKY
No!
Get me out!
BOND
This is too big for even you.
Where is
it?
ZUKOVSKY
This is a family matter! If my nephew is
in danger, we do it my way, or nothing!
Now get me out!
But he looks more worried than ever as Bond takes aim with
the harpoon gun -- squeezes the trigger.
ZUKOVSKY
No! Bond!
CHRISTMAS
(alarmed)
Bond!
Bond fires.
Zukovsky YELLS as the HARPOON SHOOTS TOWARD HIM.
It takes him a moment to realize he hasn't been hit -- the
harpoon splintering the crate, just missing him.
He clings
to the crate, exhausted, as Bond and Christmas drag him to
safety.
CHRISTMAS
Commander Bond, you are dangerous,
unpredictable, and a hothead.
He just looks at her.
CHRISTMAS
But then again, explosive devices are my
specialty.
Zukovsky scowls, wet, angry, looking from his ruined suit to
the devastation that was once his caviar factory as, behind
him, walkways CREAK, teeter, and CRASH into the sea.
ZUKOVSKY
So.
My way.
No MI-6, no Interpol.
Just
you, me and my people.
BOND
Where?
ZUKOVSKY
Istanbul.
OMITTED:233
Beyond iron balustrades we see one of the most fabulous views
in the world -- on one side the still waters of the Golden
Horn, on the other, the dancing waves of the unsheltered
Bosphorus -- and in between, the tumbling roofs, soaring
minarets and crouching mosques of the Pera district.
RENARD scans the water with night-vision binoculars.
A SUPERTANKER churns along...
ADJUST ANGLE
The CAMERA SINKS BENEATH THE WAVES, steals through the gloom -
- eventually comes upon something sitting just beneath the
belly of the tanker.
The silhouette of a SUBMARINE, hugging
the tanker's shadow, creeping undetected into the
Bosphorus...
ESTABLISH the vast city astride the Bosphorus.
The sun starting to rise.
Street vendors are the only people
about, moving their carts into place, getting ready to place
out their wares.
We hold on a BUILDING.
Teeming with people, his eyes scanning, he spots...THE BOA
climbing a ladder alongside a building to A ROOF.
Bond chases after him, clambering up, but when he gets to the
top of the roof...
Boa has now been joined by THREE THUGS.
One attacks Bond as
the Boa and the others move away...
Bond fights with the thug, they stumble across the roof,
gripping each other, until Bond gets the upper hand and
THROWS HIM DOWN through a thatched roof where he falls...
Into the market below.
Christmas, just coming into the square, sees the body
falling...she runs to the thug, thinking it might be Bond...
But the thug raises up, smiling at her, blood on his teeth.
She turns and runs...the thug gives chase...
ON THE ROOFS ABOVE
Bond is following Boa and the other two men as they LEAP from
roof to roof. He sees them jump off onto the roof of...
Motoring rapidly away from him.
He makes a spectacular leap
to a wobbly FLAG POLE that swings him toward the bus,
dropping him on the roof before it SNAPS BACK, into the
overhead TRAM WIRES ABOVE and setting off sparks.
ON THE BUS
Bond barely gets to his feet before Thug #2 is upon him.
They grapple, struggling to maintain their footing as the bus
speeds through the rickety old streets. He throws the guy
over...
The thug desperately CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF THE BUS...
Bond now takes on the third thug, unaware that number two has
climbed back on and is about to WHACK HIM ON THE HEAD with
his gun when...
THE BUS TURNS onto a new street...THE WIRES AGAIN...Thug
Two's gun is caught up in them...he is instantly
ELECTROCUTED.
Thug three watches his friend's horrible death, giving Bond
time to slug him hard across the face and THROW HIM FROM THE
BUS...
Thug two's body goes SLAMMING INTO THE WINDSHIELD of a fast
moving van...BURSTS OUT through the back doors of said van
and tumbles out onto the street where it is HIT BY A CAR.
ON THE BUS
Bond turns back toward...BOA. Now it is just the two of them.
The bus is hissing to a stop.
The Boa leaps on to the bed of a passing truck.
Bond rushes
forward and leaps on to the top of a passing taxi.
The taxi
jams on his breaks and Bond rolls across the bonnet and on to
the street.
He springs to his feet.
Fifty yards ahead the truck carrying the Boa has stopped for
traffic.
The Boa jumps out and darts into an alley.
The Alley leads into a small CAFE where PATRONS smoke water
pipes and drink coffee.
The Boa is nowhere to be seen.
Bond slips out his gun holding it out of sight close to his
leg so as not to alarm the civilians.
He steps into the
cafe.
Bond makes his way through the tables to the doorway in the
back.
He looks inside - just a few children
at play.
Bond
is suddenly blind-sided by a vicious kidney punch which
brings him to his knees.
He struggles to bring up his gun -
but the Boa knocks it out of his hand.
The Boa locks Bond's head in an unbreakable choke hold from
behind.
Bond pulls on the massive arms - but to no avail.
He glances down to his right - HIS GUN - just out of reach.
Bond reaches out for it - his fingers just graze it.
Suddenly the Boa's foot kicks out, knocking the gun across
the room.
He tighten his grip and speaks in Bond's ear.
BOA
For years I was told I could never take
the great James Bond and his Walther PPK.
What good is your gun now, Bond?
Bond can't breathe, his eyes start to dim.
He slumps
forward, his left hand touches something hot.
It's the iron
basket of coals used to keep the water pipes lite.
Bond's
fingers touch the wire handle that arches across the top.
He
grabs it and with his last reserves -
Swings it at the back of his head hitting the Boa on the side
of the head with the SOUND OF RAW BACON HITTING A HOT
SKILLET.
The Boa drops Bond and leaps to his feet holding the side of
his face.
Bond falls forward fighting for breath and trying
to clear his head.
The Boa runs out the back door.
Bond finds his gun, holsters
it and follows.
Bond comes out into a side street crowded with VENDERS AND
SHOPPERS.
Bond sees the Boa pushing his way through the
crowd to...
RUSSIAN TRAMP STEAMER taking on cargo.
Bond enters square in
time to see the Boa making a Bee line for the Russian
steamer.
As the Boa, much the worse-for-ware, starts up the gangway to
the top deck of the steamer, Bond hitches a ride on a cargo
net that is being hoisted aboard by the ship's boom.
Boa, breathing hard gets to the deck.
He lumbers across it
but before he can reach the other side he is tripped up by
Bond who has been waiting for him by the side of the deck
house.
The Boa goes sprawling.
As Bond comes for him he
scrambles to his feet, grabs a nearby bailing hook, and
swings at Bond.
But Bond is ready for him.
He wards off the
blow with a small wooden cover from a shipping crate.
He
traps the Boa's arm and gives him two quick devastating kicks
in the solar plexus.
He Boa stages back to the railing.
A
final kick from Bond sends him over the side...
THE BOA FALLS, LANDING ON HIS BACK ON THE DECK BELOW WITH A
SICKENING THUD.
Bond looks down, sees the Boa's body at a horrible angle, his
neck broken.
Bond sighs, turns...
GABOR is there. Gun trained on him.
GABOR
Welcome aboard, Mr. Bond.
BOND'S P.O.V.
A thug steps into sight below, holding
CHRISTMAS hostage as well.
A magnificent ornate tower in the centre of the Bosphorus.
An innocent-looking launch coasts up to it.
A tarp is raised
and Bond and Christmas are revealed, hands bound.
They are
helped out, led inside by a number of henchmen.
HER POV:
Big, battered and bloody, Valentin Zukovsky is leaving a
boat, moving over the rocks toward the entrance with three of
his men.
Two bodies in his trail.
He's on course for
Elektra and nothing is going to stop him, even as his
henchmen are cut down by ferocious fire.
The submarine's engines roar to life.
Sees the nose of the sub heading into the Bosphorus, half
submerged.
The hatch is still open.
He moves to the ledge. Composes himself -- and
DIVES ONE HUNDRED FEET to the water.
Amazing.
He surfaces close to the exiting sub.
Grabs a ladder, pulls
himself up.
The hatch is closing...
He splashes through the water
flooding over the sub, appears in front of the amazed sailor
shutting the hatch.
WHACKS him with the hatch.
Gets inside.
Closes it.
Milliseconds before the hatch slides under the
water.
The submarine is tilting, further and further, the nose
dropping down and down...
Pretty soon we have the strange and incredible sight of a
submarine hanging vertically, nose down.
High up on the sub, a hatch opens.
Water floods into an
escape hatch.
An inner door stops it getting into the
submarine itself.
The OUTER DOOR opens...
Bond burst out and starts the long
swim up the OUTSIDE OF THE SUBMARINE...
It's dark out here.
It would be very easy for Bond to get
disoriented.
He peers around, trying to get his bearings against the vast
vertical whale he's swimming up.
Passes the conning tower.
Bond is running out of air...
And then he sees it -- the open hatch of the rear escape
door.
He gets inside, yanks it closed...
The submarine is slowly sinking, nose down.
Air is escaping
from the many seams that are creeping apart.
We can hear the
metallic GROANS through the water.
The Torpedo doors open and Bond and Christmas are SHOT OUT
INTO THE WATER, streaking through, as behind them...
THE SUBMARINE EXPLODES in spectacular fashion.
Bond and Christmas reach the surface...
Look around them.
No boats coming to the rescue.
They wave to a tourist boat
passing.
The boat heads over to pick them up...
DISSOLVE:
OMIT 324
EST. SHOT - MI-6 - NIGHT
The damaged wing is being repaired.
A magnificent rooftop garden looking out over Istanbul.
Christmas and Bond alone with some Bollinger.
FIREWORKS explode above. They clink glasses.
He looks out at
the cityscape.
BOND
I love Christmas in Turkey.
CHRISTMAS
So isn't it time you unwrapped your
present?
It's dark, we can't really see them.
CHRISTMAS
You know James...
I think Christmas is
coming early this year.
FADE OUT
