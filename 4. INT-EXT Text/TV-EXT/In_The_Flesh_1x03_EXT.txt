      A deserted country lane on the edge of the village of 
      Roarton. It s almost dawn. Light, but the moon still in the 
      sky. Twilight. 

      A figure appears on the horizon. Walking slowly down the 
      middle of the road. It s KIEREN WALKER. Flesh cover up 
      streaked. One contact out, one in. One dead eye. One living.  

      He s walking a little dazed. A thousand thoughts rolling 
      around in his head. 

      BEEP BEEP. The PICK-UP TRUCK whizzes past him. 

      He sees: 

      Bill driving, face like thunder and RICK in the passenger 
      seat with a desperate look, motionless, expression of doom. 
      Kieren s face: WTF?

      In the back, covered in netting, tied up, still alive, are 
      the two rabid zombies from the woods; the MALE ZOMBIE and the 
      LITTLE GIRL ZOMBIE.

      Kieren stops. Looks after them. They re alive and going for 
      treatment. KIEREN s feelings are mixed. Pride he saved two 
      lives last night. Devastation, RICK isn t who he thought he 
      was. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      STEVE, in his dressing gown looks out the window. He s 
      extremely worried about Kieren s whereabouts. He repetitively 
      rubs his first finger and thumb, a nervous tick he shares 
      with his son. SUE joins him at the window. 

                                    STEVE

      Bill s pick up pulls up in front of the house. Without a 
      word, BILL exits the vehicle. 

      Bill grabs the bag of weapons and enters the house. 

      Rick follows (at a safe distance). 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      BILL is aggressively collecting the netting from the back of 
      the truck. 

      Rick enters. Watches. So wants his Dad not to be mad with 
      him. 

      The netting gets stuck on the pick up s side. Bill tugs at 
      it. 

      Rick goes to help. Bill growls:

                                    BILL
                    Get off. 

      Rick backs away, as you would from a snarling dog. 

                                    RICK
                      Sorry.

      And with that Bill walks off into the house. 

      On Rick - The horror....

      PHILIP exits Amy s house. Prepares to do the walk of shame. 
      Looks up and sees:

      Philip freezes. 

      Shirley looks up. Sees her son on a PDSsufferer s door step.  
      Freezes. 

      AWKWARD. Here s the thing; Shirley doesn t know that Philip 
      knows she s a PDSCommunity Care Officer. Shirley still 
      believes Philip believes she works at a hospice. On Philip s 
      side, he hopes to God his mother doesn t know about his 
      living dead fetish and anyway how is he going explain why 
      he s coming out of one of her patients houses without 
      spilling the beans that he knows what she thinks he doesn t 
      know. You know? 

      WHAT ARE THEY BOTH GOING TO SAY?

                                    PHILIP / SHIRLEY
                    What are you doing here? 

      Couple of more uncomfortable moments as mother and son think 
      about the lies they re going to tell each other.  

                                    SHIRLEY
                          (making it up as she goes)

                    I m doing outreach. 

      Philip looks to where his mother is staring. He goes red. 
      Does up his trouser fly.

      KIEREN is still walking into the village, reeling with  
      emotion from Rick s actions last night. He passes a LONE 
      PHONE BOX. It stands out in the desolate wilderness.  

      Kieren is looking at the phone box. He sees in the phone box 
      window reflection a building. Intrigued, Kieren turns and 
      sees: In the distance a lone small SUPERMARKET. The 
        supermarket looks awfully familiar.   

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN stands outside looking up at the open supermarket. 
      From a distance he wasn t so sure, but now up close it cannot 
      be denied:

      This is the same supermarket from his flashbacks. The place 
      where he killed Lisa Lancaster.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Back in present day. KIEREN comes stumbling out of the 
        supermarket, head reeling from the startling revelation. His 
      sister saved him. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      RICK is standing in the phone box that Kieren was looking at 
      in the scene previous. Rick s edgy as hell, even though 
      there s not a thing in sight, he checks that there s no one 
      that could possibly see him. When he s sure the coast is 
      clear he takes out the coins his mum gave him and puts them 
      in the slot.   

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Rick, almost tearing his hair out in frustration, is leaving 
      an impassioned message on the Walker s voice mail.

                    Shit!

      Rick puts down the receiver. Was that enough? What if Kieren 
      doesn t listen to the voice mail? Should he try calling 
      again? Rick searches in his pocket for more coins when his 
      wrist watch beeps. It s been half an hour. He s already taken 
      up all the time he can without it looking suspicious. 

      Rick resigns himself. Puts down the phone and exits the 
      booth. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      GARY and DEAN are approaching the disused basket ball court 
      that was used to cage rogue rabid s back in the day. It is 
      currently being used to store paint for branding PDS

      Dean is LIMPING (due to his bitten leg which has been

      counting the cash they both got from handing in the set of  
      rabid s last night.

      PHILIP is on the drive holding a paint pot. He s doing a rush 
      job. If Bill catches him he s...

      Too late. BILL opens the door holding a shotgun. 

      Philip starts to edge away. 

                                    BILL
                      Fuckyerdoin ? 

      Philip produces a piece of paper from his pocket. Holds it up 
      like a shield.  

                                    PHILIP
                      Proposal was voted in this morning. 
                    All houses with PDSsufferers 
                      inside must be identified. 

      Bill snatches the piece of paper off Philip. Philip edges out 
      of the Macyproperty. 

      Bill reads. His frown deepens. He gets to a certain 
      paragraph. His eyes widen and he turns to see:

      On his front door a  Z  has been painted. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 21.



        CONTINUED:2222

      Bill pumps the shotgun and spins back to where Philip was. 

      Philip has wisely fled. 

      Dean has witnessed all this from the cage.

                                    DEAN
                            (shouting over)
                      Serge! 

      Bill looks over at Dean in the cage.

                                    DEAN (CONT D)
                          (re. his situation)
                    Know how yerfeeling!

      Bill gives Dean a look of disdain -  you re a suspected 
      rotter, how am I like you? 

      Rick s pick up pulls up. 

      Bill watches as his son gets out the pick up. Bill stares at 
      Rick as if seeing him for the first time. 

                                    RICK
                          (sees shotgun)
                      What s happened? 

                                    BILL
                      Nothing. Get inside and change into 
                      yersuit. We re going to church.  

      Rick nods, does as he s told and enters the house. 

      Bill stays a moment. Looking up and down the street. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      GARY is knocking on the door. Paint pot and brush in hand 
      with another piece of paper. 

      AMY, still wearing her nightie (vintage of course) opens the 
      door. Gary takes in the view. 

                                  AMY
                    What do you want?

      Gary gives her the piece of paper.

      DUNCAN and PATTY LANCASTER are exiting their home in their

      JEM approaches them. We see KIEREN in the background.

      DEAN, sweating and starving, is pressed up to the cage, 
        desperately scanning the street for anyone to help. 

      He spots A TEENAGER walking down the street. 

                                    DEAN
                    Lad! Mate! 

      The Teenager stops by the cage. Dean offers a tenner through 
      the wire. 

                                    DEAN (CONT D)

      The Teenager snatches the tenner from Dean s fingers and 
      scarpers. 

      Dean curses. Takes out another tenner from his reward bundle. 

      Dean spots a PLUMP OLD DEAR coming down the street.

      Dean slumps down on the wire. He s given up on humanity. 

      From his slumped position he sees a pair of shoes coming down 
      the street. 

                                    DEAN (CONT D)

      The feet stop. Dean springs up and sees: KEN. 

      Dean s heart drops. He looks down.

      KIEREN and JEM. 

      Kieren standing on the platform, looking where the tracks go. 
      Jem is on her usual bench. Slugging some cider.

      Kieren nods. 

      SOUND of a person coming down the stations steps. 

      Kieren and Jem look up to see:

      AMY walking down the stairs, a over stuffed VINTAGE SUITCASE 
      slung over her shoulder. Amy doesn t clock Kieren or Jem. 

      Kieren watches Amy cross to the other platform, put down her 
      bag and wait for a train. 

      Jem takes this as her cue.

                                  JEM (CONT D)
                    I m gonnago.

      Kieren s torn. He wants to go see how Amy s doing, but also 
      he wants to be loyal to his sister. Jem sees this. Makes it 
      easy on him.

      Kieren smiles at his little sister s cheekiness. She turns to

                    Yes you are. 

      Jem leaves with a very cheeky grin on her face.

      Kieren smiles to himself as he watches Jem go. Glad the 
      normal brother and sister teasing has begun again.

                      I know you. 

      Amy smiles in recognition of the impression (the smile s a 
      sad one though). Kieren sees she s back to wearing cover up.

      Amy nods. Chokes up. It s clear to her now that Kieren really 
      cares for her.

      Amy manages to break the embrace. Steps on the train. The 
      whistle blows. The train begins to move. Amy waves good bye. 
      Kieren waves good bye back.

      armband on she looks younger, more like a teenage girl than

      She gives herself a moment to silently say goodbye to Smithy

      A moment. 

      Jem is about to leave when she spots THE CORDLESS PHONE on 
      top of the freezer -  Oh, there s where I left it .

      He breaks into a run...

      ...Kieren gets to the figure lying on the drive. He turns the 
      figure over...

      We see who it is.

      It's Rick Macy. Dead. A Red Hunting Knife buried in the back 
      of his head. 

      Kieren cradles Rick in his arms. The pain is overwhelming.

      Kieren looks around. Someone must have seen something, Why 
      has no one come out to help? He sees Ken looking out the 
      window. He turns and sees more curtains twitching in other 
      houses. They're scared. They're all scared. Deathly afraid of 
      the man who did this...

      Bill Macy.

      The overwhelming sorrow turns to overwhelming anger. Kieren 
      takes the knife and stands. He strides off, meeting his out 
      of breath sister on her way home.

                                  JEM
                      Kieren? 

      A tight, determined Kieren passes her silently.

      Jem looks towards where Rick lies. She runs towards her 
      house.

                                                                            CUT TO:





      BILL exits his front door, squints in the daylight...  

      BOOM

      Bill s blown back off his feet by a shotgun blast. Dead 
      before he hits the floor.  

                                                                            CUT TO:



      BILL is dead.

      ANGLE ON: KEN BURTON, holding his ANTIQUE SHOTGUN.

      That s for Maggie. That s for Rick. That s for all the people 
      Bill has terrorized in Roarton. 

      Ken turns and walks away from the bloody scene.

      ON: Dean in the cage, who had been chomping on the coronation 
      chicken sandwich Ken had got for him, he has witnessed the 
      shooting. He is presently agog, in shock, holding his half 
      eaten sarniein his hand. 

      Kieren (holding the knife) and Janet come out the house. They 
      both see Bill. 

      Utter shock. 

      Janet, stunned, crosses to Bill, kneels by his side.   

      Kieren looks up at Dean in the cage. 

      Dean holds his hands up.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 59.

      PHILIP is in the middle of painting a  Z  in green paint on a 
      front door. The owner of the house MRS BENNETT (62), hangs 
      out the window, flanked by a SHAPE of a PERSON next to her. 
      This is her PDSson, HENRY. 

      We see in the background BILL s PICK UP TRUCK drive past. In 
      the front with BILL, is RICK, looking very pale and rigid. 

                                  MRS BENNETT
                    I ve just had that door varnished.

                                  MRS BENNETT
                    Is he sick and wrong? He used to be 
                    your friend.

      Philip looks at Kieren, who ignores him and walks on.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN stands outside the entrance to the cave. He s scared 
      to go in there. To face up to what it represents. But so much 
      has happened. He needs to face this. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Time has passed. It s a double funeral. Bill and Rick. Father 
      and son. Two processions. All the village in attendance 
      including the WHOLE WALKER FAMILY. We see from which villager 
      follows which coffin where their allegiance lies. It s fifty 
      fifty. 

      Each set of mourners give the other mourners daggers of 
      mistrust. 

      RICK S FUNERAL PROCESSION. 

      KIEREN is at the front carrying Rick s coffin. 

      Rick s other pallbearers are: JEM, DEAN and HENRY BENNETT. 

      Janet follows Rick s coffin.  

      VICAR ODDIE follows both processions. 

      GARY crosses from Bill s procession and comes up to Vicar 
      Oddie.

                                    GARY
                    It s not right. 

      Vicar Oddie turns to him. But says nothing. 

                                    GARY (CONT D)
                            (whispers)

                    Was the Walker boy. 

      Vicar Oddie looks over to Kieren carrying the coffin. There s 
      a new found confidence and strength about him.

                     The righteous perish, and no one

      KIEREN looks from Rick s grave to the crowd. A community

      PHILIP moves from BILL s grave and sidles up to KIEREN.

      He silently says good bye. 

      Then Kieren stands and exits frame. 

      We stay on Rick s grave. We stay on it expecting the lad to

      Hold for a few moments...

      ...No one bursts up. For today, the dead rest.

      On her door, written in pink paint, bold as you like is a 
      love heart and in the love heart is written:

       AMY + KIEREN FOREVER 

      Kieren looks at the lovely graffiti. Smiles sadly.  

      He misses his friend.

                    It s alright....

      Kieren takes out a handkerchief, dips it in a puddle and 
      wipes his cheek. Some flesh tone cover up comes off, showing 
      his naturally pale skin.

                      ...I m like you.
