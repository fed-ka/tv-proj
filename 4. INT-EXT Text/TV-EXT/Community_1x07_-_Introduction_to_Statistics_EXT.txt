A tiny Sr. Chang drives a giant Jeff on a moped.  A car cuts 
him off.

SR. CHANG
Nice blinker assface!

around her.  They pass our group and various lame party-goers *
are standing outside the doors, looking through the windows 
with concern.

desk fortress.*

Ahhhhhh!

Jeff reluctantly stops.  Britta notices a guy in a grim 
reeper outfit peering at Pierce through the window.  She 
pulls him away.

BRITTA
Dude.  Not helping.

guardian for these people? *

JEFF

She kisses him on the cheek and EXITS.  Jeff stares at the *
Comfort Inn Platinum card wistfully.  He heads in.  Chang *
mopeds by holding up an  L  on his helmet.*


PAN UP to the top of a building to find Abed, in his Batman 
costume, standing on the ledge.  He nods, proudly, MISSION 
ACCOMPLISHED.*

FADE OUT.
