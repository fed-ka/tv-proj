                                          TEASER

      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 

      A long winding street somewhere in small town, USA.  The road 
      is empty when a car FLIES by.  Florida plates.   

      INT. CAR - NIGHT

      Behind the wheel is CASSIE BLAKE, 16, having a private moment 
      with the STEREO.  Singing her heart out.  Something she d 
      never do around anyone else.  But alone -- she s a rock star.  
      An extremely off-key rock star.  Ridiculously cute.   

      CLOSE ON HER FACE.  A scrubbed clean natural beauty.  She has 
      that loner stare.  All question and doubt.  

      She s startled by a HONKING HORN.  Headlights blind.  As a 
      car WHIZZES by, passing her.  She road rages. 

                                  CASSIE
                    C mon.  Really?  Asshole.

      But then -- her front wheel EXPLODES.  A blowout.  The car 
      jerks and skids, careening off the road.  

      Cassie responds instantly.  She lets off the gas, turns into 
      the skid, and the car jerks and grinds to a stop. 

      EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - NIGHT

      Cassie gets out, looks to her front tire.  It s flat.  Cassie 
      groans in frustration.  Looks around.  Lots of trees.  Houses 
      in the distance.  Not a lot of options.  But then--

      She sees a car IDLING half a block up the road.  The same one 
      that passed her.  It just sits there.  As if watching.  She 
      can t make out who s behind the wheel.  She calls out.

                                  CASSIE
                    Hey... Can I get a...?

      The car quickly speeds away.  Fuck you very much.  Cassie 
      goes back to her car, reaches in for her cell phone.  

      EXT. BLAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

      A modest house in a modest neighborhood.  Lights burn within.                                                                                      2.


      INT. BLAKE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      A small, comfortable home.  Cozy is the key word.  Eclectic 
      is runner up.   A phone RINGS.  AMELIA BLAKE answers it. Mid-
      30 s, effortless beauty.

      She s cooking.  Boiling pasta, sauce, salad fixings, etc.

                                  CASSIE
                          (from phone)
                    I got a flat.

                                  AMELIA
                    Where are you?  

      SCENE INTERCUTS:

      EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - NIGHT

      Cassie pulls a spare from her trunk.  A self-sufficient girl.

                                  CASSIE
                    Three blocks away.  

                                  AMELIA
                    Who said you could take the car? 

                                  CASSIE
                    That s really not relevant right 
                    now. 

                                  AMELIA
                    Are you okay?  Did you call AAA?  

                                  CASSIE
                    I can change a tire, mom. 

                                  AMELIA
                    You have to ask me before you take 
                    the car, Cassie.

      EXT. BLAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

      A car pulls up and comes to a stop in front of the house.  
      It s the same car that passed Cassie in the road.  Beat.  

      INT. BLAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

      Back inside the house, Amelia continues with Cassie.

                                  CASSIE
                    Can you wait til I get home to yell 
                    at me?  This was a courtesy call.                                                                                      3.

      CONTINUED:

      INSTANT PHONE STATIC.  The call drops.  

                        CASSIEAMELIA
      Hello?Cassie?  

      Amelia hangs up.  Starts to redial as she goes to the sink to 
      rinse some vegetables.

      EXT. BLAKE HOUSE - STREET - NIGHT

      The car continues to IDLE.  The driver s door opens.  A MAN 
      gets out.  He s mid-30 s.  Pale skin.  Piercing blue eyes.  
      Eerie beautiful.  He stares at the house, eyes transfixed.

      He drinks from a bottle of water.  Takes a sip and then 
      proceeds to pour the rest of it out.  Onto the road.

      INT. BLAKE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Water SPRAYS from the faucet unexpectedly.  Dousing Amelia.  

                                  AMELIA
                    Dammit.  

      She goes to turn off the faucet.  But a pipe s busted.  It 
      gushes water onto the floor... everywhere.  

      ON THE MAN OUTSIDE

      He withdraws a box of matches.  Strikes a SINGLE MATCH.

      IN THE KITCHEN

      A burner on the stove IGNITES -- the FLAMES SHOOTING HIGH 
      ABOVE THE STOVE.  Amelia quickly turns it off.

      ON THE MAN OUTSIDE

      He strikes another match.  

      IN THE KITCHEN 

      Another burner IGNITES.  The flames SHOOT UP.  

      An INTERCUT of matches and fire.  As all four burners SPIT 
      FLAMES OF FIRE.  Amelia steps back.  Stunned.  Terrified.  

      The flames quickly begin to CLIMB THE WALL to the ceiling.  

      There s recognition on Amelia s face.  Pure horror.  And then 
      the slightest whisper...                                                                                       4.

      CONTINUED:

                                  AMELIA (CONT D)
                    Cassie...

      She turns to run... She takes one step and SLIPS on the wet 
      floor.  Her feet fly from under, she lands hard ON HER BACK.  
      Her head CRACKS against the kitchen floor.  She goes still.  
      As the fire SPREADS.  Up the walls, to the ceiling.

      Amelia s eyes flicker open.  She tries to rise up.  Only semi-
      conscious.  She rolls over and crawls to her knees.  She s 
      wet and her head is bleeding. 

      But she s determined.  She half crawls, half stumbles to the 
      living room where she knocks over a LAMP.  Its BULB EXPLODES 
      catching fire.  The fire quickly leaps onto drapes nearby.  

      In seconds, the drapes and entire wall go up in flames.

      ON THE MAN OUTSIDE

      As he holds a burning match.  He drops it.  Then withdraws 
      MANY MATCHES.  He moves to strike them all at once.

      INSIDE THE HOUSE

      Amelia, weak and horror-stricken, limps to the front door.  
      She barely reaches it when the MATCHES IGNITE.

      A moment of pure silence.  And then, the house EXPLODES INTO 
      FLAMES, ENGULFING Amelia.  

      ON THE MAN as he watches the house burn a moment.  Then, he 
      gets into his car and drives away.  Beat.  

      INT. CAR - NIGHT - LATER

      Cassie drives down the street, turning a corner.  She hears 
      SIRENS.  Sees the FLASHING LIGHTS.  The fire trucks.  An 
      OFFICER in the road stops her.  

      CLOSE ON CASSIE S FACE.  As the realization sinks in.  The 
      next moments are a blur as Cassie steps from the car.  Sees 
      HER HOUSE.  The flames.  The firemen at work.  

      Her knees buckle, she begins to sway...  

      She tries to speak...  But all sound...  All motion...  

      Everything comes to a horrifying halt.  As Cassie Blake s 
      world is destroyed.

      EXT. OCEAN - DAY

      An AERIAL SHOT flies over the ocean coming upon land.  An 
      amazing vista of cliff, rocks, and crashing ocean below.  

      The CAMERA finds a lone car making its way down the winding 
      road that traces the edge of the cliff.

      SUPER: ONE MONTH LATER

      INT. CASSIE S CAR - DAY

      Cassie is behind the wheel.  Her car is packed full of 
      luggage and belongings.  She takes in the view.  Her eyes are 
      still alive with curiosity.  But there s a sadness that lives 
      within her now.  

      The car passes a sign.  WELCOME TO NEW SALEM, MAINE.  EST. 
      1692.

      EXT. NEW SALEM - DAY

      Cassie s car drives through an impossibly charming town.  She 
      passes quaint, family-owned stores on MAIN STREET, a 
      picturesque MARINA, a LUSH FOREST, and beautifully maintained 
      COLONIAL HOMES.

      EXT. JANE S HOUSE - DAY

      Cassie pulls up to an old two-story colonial house and parks.  
      She checks the address, makes sure it s the right one.   She 
      gets out.  Looks around.  Takes it all in.  This is her new 
      home.  

      She sees a NEIGHBOR working in the yard nearby.  She smiles 
      and waves.  But the NEIGHBOR just stares.  Odd.

      She hears a window open.  Looks to the house next door.  

      From an upstairs window, she sees someone -- a FIGURE --  
      staring at her.  She can t make out a face.  It s eerie.  
      Just then--

                                  JANE 
                    Cassie!  You re here.

      Cassie turns to see her grandmother, JANE BLAKE, come down 
      the porch steps to greet her.  Jane is a proper, New England 
      dame in her 50 s.  She wraps Cassie in her arms and squeezes 
      tight.  Beat.  As they both fight back their tears.  When 
      they finally break, Jane is composed and cheery.                                                                                        6.

      CONTINUED:

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    How was your trip?  I wish you 
                    would have let me drive with you.

      They go to Cassie s car and start to unload.  

                                  CASSIE
                    You do not want to be in the car 
                    with me for that long, Grandma.  I 
                    have road rage.

                                  JANE
                    I was worried.  I felt like I was 
                      abandoning you after the service.  
                    How ya doing?

                                  CASSIE
                    At the moment.  Good.  Five minutes 
                    from now.  Who knows?

      And Cassie means this.  It s moment to moment with her.  Jane 
      smiles.  They share another moment, connected by sadness and 
      love and longing.  

                                  JANE
                    I m really glad you re here. 

      INT. JANE S HOUSE - FOYER/LIVING ROOM - DAY

      An old and elegant home.  Full of history.  Cassie looks 
      around.  

                                  CASSIE
                    So.  This is where my mom grew up.

                                  JANE
                    She took her first steps right 
                    there.  And just kept right on 
                    going.  I ll show you your room.

      Cassie follows her grandmother up the stairs with her bags.  

      INT. CASSIE S BEDROOM - DAY

      Jane clicks on the light to reveal Amelia s bedroom - 
      untouched since the day she left.  A shrine to a teenage girl 
      from the 80 s.  Cassie takes it all in, wide-eyed.

                                  CASSIE
                    It s like a mom museum.                                                                                      7.

      CONTINUED:

                                  JANE
                    We can move everything out.  I 
                    should have by now.  It s only 
                    been... sixteen years.  

      Cassie runs her hand along an old STONE FIREPLACE.  Ornate 
      ETCHED PATTERNS carved in the stone.  It s beautiful.  Framed 
      photos line the mantle.  The photos feature Amelia and a 
      TIGHT CIRCLE OF FRIENDS.  

                                  CASSIE
                    There s so much about her I didn t 
                    know... why did she leave here? 

                                  JANE
                    She told you nothing at all.

      This is more of a question.  As Jane studies her.  Cassie 
      shakes her head.  

                                  CASSIE
                    I asked but she was always so full 
                    of non-answers.  I gave up.

                                  JANE
                    Things got difficult for her.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Is that code for pregnant?

      Jane simply smiles.  She doesn t confirm or deny.  

                                  JANE
                    I ll let you get settled.  I ll be 
                      downstairs.  

      Jane leaves her.  Cassie looks around.  To the wall of 
      photos.  A beautiful RED-HAIRED GIRL appears with Amelia in 
      most of the photos, but Cassie is drawn to ONE BOY in 
      particular who is featured prominently.

      Cassie stares at a photo of her mother.  The hurt shows all 
      over her face.  This is a real pain that s not going away 
      anytime soon.  Beat.  

      EXT. JANE S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Time has passed.  It s night.  The light is on in the 
      upstairs bedroom.                                                                                      8.


      INT. CASSIE S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Cassie can be seen in the adjoining bathroom.  She s brushing 
      her teeth.  She wears a night shirt.  She finishes up and 
      clicks the light and starts for her bed.  She notices the 
      curtain open.   

      She goes to the window -- looks out -- she can see into the 
      house next door.  Into a bedroom like hers.  It s the same 
      house from earlier.  But now the light is on.

      She can see a YOUNG MAN (NICK) staring at her.  He doesn t 
      wear a shirt.  Just gym shorts.  He s handsome.  Good 
      physique.  And he knows it.  He gives her a nod.  Cassie 
      closes the drapes. 

      Cassie opens a suitcase.  She s unpacking.  She takes some 
      clothes and opens a dresser.  Fills it up, all while HUMMING.  
      She closes a drawer but it s JAMMED.  She reaches in to see 
      what s causing the problem and is surprised when she pulls 
      out the culprit.  

      A SILVER NECKLACE with a CIRCLE PENDANT.  It s made up of 
      eight blue stones and connected by a CRYSTAL PATTERN.  It s 
      beautiful.  Cassie puts it on, continuing to HUM when...

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    Your mom used to hum that.  

      Jane s standing in the doorway.  

                                  CASSIE
                    I stole it from her.  She used to 
                    hum it all the time.  

      A shared smile.  

                                  JANE
                    Ready for your first day of school?  

                                  CASSIE
                    Is anyone ever?

                                  JANE
                    If you have trouble sleeping, your 
                    mom used to count the stars.  
                    Night, honey.

      Stars?  Cassie s not sure what she means.  Jane smiles, 
      closes the door as Cassie crawls into bed, clutching her 
      newly found PENDANT.  She turns out the side lamp.                                                                                      9.

      CONTINUED:

      Falls back into bed.  Staring up.  As the ceiling ILLUMINATES 
      before her eyes.  As she discovers a GLOW-IN-THE-DARK SOLAR 
      SYSTEM.  She smiles.  Now, she understands what Jane was 
      referring to.  There s something magical about it.  She 
      stares at it in wonder, feeling a little closer to her mom. 

      EXT. NEW SALEM - MORNING

      A new day begins.  Newspapers are delivered.  Fishermen ready 
      their boats.  Crossing guards help kids to school.

      EXT. NEW SALEM H.S. - CONTINUOUS

        Establishing shot of a small town high school.

      INT. NEW SALEM H.S. - CONTINUOUS

      Cassie walks down the hall.  She's nervous and avoids eye 
      contact but can't shake the feeling that everyone's staring.  
      And judging.  She wears her mom's pendant.

                                  DAWN (O.S.)
                    We re happy to have you, Cassie.

      INT. NEW SALEM H.S. - VICE PRINCIPAL S OFFICE - DAY

      Cassie sits across from the RED-HAIRED GIRL from her mom's 
      photos - but 16 years older.  Vice Principal DAWN 
        CHAMBERLAIN, a strikingly beautiful woman in her late 30's.

                                  DAWN
                    I m Vice Principal Chamberlain.  
                    It's so great to meet you.  I knew 
                    your mother.

                                  CASSIE
                    Yes, I was looking at pictures in 
                    her room last night.  I recognize 
                    you.  

                                  DAWN
                    Not my Sheena Easton period, I 
                    hope?  I guess she didn't talk 
                    about me much.

      Cassie feels badly for having brought it up.

                                  CASSIE
                    She didn't talk about New Salem at 
                    all.  

      This affects Dawn.  She feels the loss too.                                                                                      10.

                                  DAWN
                    Your mother holds a dear place in 
                    my heart.  Whatever I can do to 
                    help with your transition.  

      There's a KNOCK at the door.  SALLY WALTMAN enters.  African 
      American, 16.  A never-changing expression of dubiousness.

                                  DAWN (CONT D)
                    Sally's going to give you a tour.  
                    Junior editor at the paper and 
                    knows this place better then I do.

      INT. NEW SALEM H.S. - HALLWAY - DAY

      The hallway is full of STUDENTS.  TWO GIRLS walk and talk.  
      Both 17 and stylishly sexy.  FAYE, can play the danger card, 
      has sharp eyes.  Sees everything.  MELISSA, African-American, 
      steely, disinterested.

                                    MELISSA
                    Have you seen her yet?

                                  FAYE
                    No, have you?

      Melissa shakes her head.  Nope.  They reach NICK ARMSTRONG, 
      17, who stands with TWO PREPPIE FRESHMEN.  He s the guy 
      Cassie saw in the window.  The freshmen slink off as Nick 
      pockets a WAD OF CASH.

                                  FAYE (CONT D)
                    Five to ten by the time you re 
                    twenty.  

                                  NICK
                    Loosen up, Faye.

                                  FAYE
                    So? 

                                  NICK
                    What? 

                                  FAYE
                    Your new neighbor.  Did you see 
                    her? 

                                  NICK
                    She got in last night.                                                                                    11.

      CONTINUED:

                                    MELISSA
                    And?

                                  NICK
                          (to irritate Faye)
                    Ugly.  Real, real ugly.  Unless 
                    you re looking at her hot little 
                    body or her sexy, cute face.  

                                  FAYE
                    Anything else?

      Nick looks at Faye coolly.  Shrugs.  Off Faye, as Nick walks 
      away --

      INT. NEW SALEM H.S. - ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY

      Cassie struggles to keep up with a bubbly Sally who walks 
      briskly through the crowded hall, pointing as she goes...

                                  SALLY
                      Auditorium.  Study Hall.  One of 
                    two blind spots in the questionably 
                    legal surveillance system.

                                  CASSIE
                    I hope the other one's the girl's 
                    bathroom.

      Sally registers the comment.  Smiles.

                                  SALLY
                    The cliques are pretty standard.  
                    So no surprises there.  I m more 
                    the artsy crowd.  What about you?  
                    Who do you gravitate towards?

                                  CASSIE
                    The loner crowd are my people.  

                                  SALLY
                    That would be just you.

      Cassie taps her head.

                                  CASSIE
                    And the voices.

      Sally stares at her, weirdly.  

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                    Yeah, I didn t think that would 
                    land.                                                                                      12.

      CONTINUED:

      Sally smiles.  Cassie s oddly cool.  She likes her.  Sally 
      stops in front of a locker, indicates --

                                  SALLY
                    This one s yours.  

      Cassie takes out the combination, tries to open the locker.  

                                  SALLY (CONT D)
                          (pointing)
                    Bitch clique incoming.  

      She s referring to Faye and Melissa who are coming down the 
      hall, right towards them.  As Cassie struggles with the lock--

                                  SALLY (CONT D)
                    Snobby, self-centered, and a little 
                    creepy.  Definitely unique.

      As Faye and Melissa approach, they can t help but look Cassie 
      up and down.  It makes her uncomfortable.  Cassie gives up on 
      the lock.

                                  SALLY (CONT D)
                    Bad news.  I d stay clear.  Your 
                    first class is Econ.  Down the 
                    hall.  Good luck.

      As Sally walks away, Cassie turns to steal another glance at 
      Faye and Melissa, only to find them walking straight up to 
      her.  Faye s stare is chilling.

                                  FAYE
                    So you re the new girl.

                                  CASSIE
                    I m Cassie.

                                  FAYE
                      Interesting.
                          (then, re: lock)
                    Try it again. 

      Faye walks away.  Cassie tries the lock.  It SLIDES OPEN.  
      Weird.  Off Cassie, what just happened? 

      INT. NEW SALEM H.S. - CLASSROOM - DAY

      Cassie enters the classroom as STUDENTS take their seats.  
      She sees a girl waving her over.  This is DIANA MEADE, 18.  
      Smart.  Sexy.  Not overly done up.  More of a classic beauty.                                                                                       13.

      CONTINUED:

                                  DIANA
                    Over here, sit.  I saved it for 
                    you.  I m Diana.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Cassie.

                                  DIANA
                    I know.  I live on your block.  Two 
                    doors down.  Your Grandmother told 
                    me you were coming.  I m so glad 
                    you re here.

                                  CASSIE
                    You are?

      Cassie stares at her.  Finds Diana s friendliness infectious.

                                  DIANA
                    Oh yeah, it just so happens I was 
                    in the market for a new friend.  
                    And Voila.  Fate.  

      Diana smiles.  It s genuine.  Cassie likes her instantly.  
      Across the room, Cassie sees DOUG, 17, a jock, spinning an up-
      ended FOOTBALL on his desk.  He takes his hand away.  The 
      FOOTBALL keeps SPINNING.  

      Just as the football seems to be spinning a little too long 
      of its own accord, Doug s eyes meet Diana s.  The football 
      wobbles.  As Cassie takes this in --

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    What are you doing tonight?  We all 
                    hang out at the Marina.  Will you 
                    come?  I ll introduce you around.

      Cassie has a good feeling about Diana.  She can sense she has 
      a good heart.  Cassie smiles, happy to have connected with 
      someone.  Her official  first friend. 

      EXT. MARINA - NIGHT

      Cassie s car pulls up to the marina and parks in front of the 
      BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL.  She gets out and heads inside.  As 
      Cassie sees Diana through the window and waves, we re --

      INT. BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL - NIGHT

      Old wooden tables, sawdust on the floor.  TEENS and OTHER 
      PATRONS loiter about, eating, etc.  It s the local hot spot.                                                                                    14.

      CONTINUED:

      Diana sits at a BACK BOOTH.  Melissa, Doug, and Nick play 
      pool in the b.g.  Faye approaches Diana --

                                  FAYE
                    How s the new girl? 

                                  DIANA
                    You should get to know her.  

                                  FAYE
                    I don t know if she s worth getting 
                    to know yet.

                                  DIANA
                    She s a Blake.

                                  FAYE
                    Every family has duds.  Maybe we 
                    should nudge her, see what she s 
                    made of.

      As Cassie enters and walks toward them --

                                  DIANA
                    Her mom just died.  Give her time.  
                          (then)
                    I mean it, Faye.

      Cassie approaches.  Faye gives her a big smile.  

                                  FAYE
                    Hi, I m Faye Chamberlain. 

      Cassie has no intention of kissing ass.

                                  CASSIE
                    Yeah, we met.  Sort of. 

                                  FAYE
                    And I m sure you met my mother.  
                    The Vice-Principal.  Red hair?  
                    Bitchy? 

                                  CASSIE
                    She seemed nice to me.

                                  DIANA
                    Have a seat, Cassie.  Faye was just 
                    leaving.  

      Cassie sits.  Faye eyes her pendant.                                                                                        15.

                    That s a beautiful necklace.  

      She gives Diana a  knowing  look.

                                  CASSIE
                    It was my mom s.  

                                  FAYE
                    I heard.  I m so sorry.  How did 
                    she die exactly?

                                  DIANA
                    Faye.  Manners. 

                                  FAYE
                    Too soon?

                                  CASSIE
                    There was a fire.  Faulty wiring.  

      Diana shoots a disbelieving stare at Faye. 

                                  FAYE
                    And your father?  Where s he?

      Beat.  That s always a tough question for Cassie.

                                  CASSIE
                    I don t know my father. 

                                  DIANA
                    Stop badgering the new girl.  

      Faye looks at Diana.  Cassie senses a power struggle between 
      these too.  But Faye relaxes.  Smiles, warmly, changing her 
      demeanor completely.

                                  FAYE
                    I make a horrible first impression, 
                    Cassie.  It s the cliche in me.  
                    Give me a chance, I turn into a 
                    real person.  You ll see. 

      Cassie is completely won over by this honesty.  It s so real 
      and insightful. 

                                  FAYE (CONT D)
                    You guys have fun.

      Faye gets up and leaves but not before looking at Diana.  
       Happy?   Faye goes to join Nick, Melissa, and Doug, who are 
      watching Cassie from the back of the tavern.                                                                                     16.

                    They re all your friends?

                                  DIANA
                    Depends on the day.    

      Cassie feels on display.  She looks around, uncomfortably.  
      Notices a MAN sitting at the bar, staring at her.   This is 
      ETHAN, late 30 s, haggard.  His intense gaze adds to her 
      general feeling of uneasiness. 

                                  CASSIE
                    I m sorry.  I don t think I m in 
                    the mood for being social, after 
                    all.  It s been a long day and...

      As Cassie starts to get up --

                                  DIANA
                    At least meet my boyfriend.  He s 
                    around here somewhere. 

                                  CASSIE
                    Next time.  Promise.

      Diana nods, very understanding.  

      EXT. BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL - NIGHT 

      Cassie exits the tavern.  

      INT. BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL - NIGHT

      Faye is at the FRONT WINDOW, watching Cassie walk to her car.   
      Melissa walks up beside her.  

                                    MELISSA
                    What do you think? 

      Faye doesn t answer.  Just keeps watching Cassie.

      EXT. BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      Cassie approaches her car.  BEEPS the lock.  Gets inside.

      INSIDE THE CAR

      She starts the engine when -- it just turns over.  She tries 
      it again.  Nothing.  Then again.  This time something SPARKS.  
      Under the hood.  Then--

      SMOKE BEGINS to blow out her AC VENTS.  What the...?                                                                                    17.

      CONTINUED:

      Cassie reaches for the door.  When the CAR S DOORS LOCK BY 
      THEMSELVES.  

      Suddenly, FLAMES IGNITE from under the hood.  They seep out, 
      rising up.  Instant fear.  Cassie loses it, begins to panic.  

      INT. BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL - NIGHT

      Faye is at the window, quietly watching, whispering...

                                  FAYE
                    Put it out, put it out...

      EXT. BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      The hood of Cassie s car is completely engulfed in flames.  
      Others have taken notice.  Patrons come racing out of the 
      tavern.  A WOMAN yells --

                                  WOMAN
                    Oh my God!!!  Help!!!

      INT. CASSIE S CAR - NIGHT

      Cassie BEATS and KICKS on the door.  Why won t it unlock?  
      She s freaking out.  COUGHING.  CHOKING.  The inside of the 
      car is full of smoke.  She can t breathe.  Pure horror... 

      A YOUNG MAN appears at the window.  He s there to help her.  
      As he pulls on the locked car door, he directs a RAISED HAND 
      at the FLAMES, which seem to recede.    

      It all happens very fast, but as the Young Man stares 
      INTENSELY at the car, the doors UNLOCK.  Quickly, he rips the 
      door open and pulls Cassie from the car. 

      He takes her in his arms and carries her several feet from 
      the car and lays her down on the ground where Cassie s 
      COUGHING subsides.  Her eyes flutter open and she stares into 
      her savior s face. 

      Handsome.  Square jaw.  Sexy dimple.  Million dollar smile.  

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    Are you okay?

      Off Cassie -- as she contemplates her answer.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    18.


                                        ACT TWO

      EXT. BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL - PARKING LOT - FEW MINUTES LATER

      The car is no longer on fire.  Some lingering smoke.

      A CROWD surrounds Cassie.  The handsome guy who saved her is 
      still there too.  ADAM CONANT, 19.  Cassie tries to stand.  
      Diana is there.

                                  ADAM
                    Let me help you.

                                  DIANA
                    Are you okay?  

      He takes her, helps her up.  She s taken with this guy.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Thank you.  I don t know what 
                    happened.  

                                  ADAM
                    Your car caught on fire.  

                                  CASSIE
                    I got that part.  

      Diana looks to FAYE and MELISSA who hang back from the crowd  
      with DOUG and NICK.  She s really unhappy with them.  
      Admonishing them with her stare.  

                                  DIANA
                    Your engine must have gone kaput.  

                                  CASSIE
                    But the doors wouldn t open.

                                  ADAM
                    Maybe you panicked and locked the 
                    doors when you were trying to 
                    unlock them.  

                                  CASSIE
                    No.  They wouldn t open.  And who 
                    put the fire out?

                                  DIANA
                    It went out by itself.  Thank God 
                    you re okay.  But at least you met 
                    Adam.  

      Cassie looks at Adam.  Smiles.  Hi.                                                                                    19.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ADAM
                    Diana told me about you.  

                                  DIANA
                    Adam s my boyfriend.  

      Oh.  Not what she wanted to hear.  Cassie visibly deflates.     

      EXT. JANE S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Diana s car pulls up in front of Cassie s house.  

      INT. DIANA S CAR - NIGHT

      Cassie is still a little shaken.  She reaches for the door.

                                  DIANA
                    I m sorry about your car.

                                  CASSIE
                    I just don t understand it.

                                  DIANA
                    Maybe the mechanic will have an 
                    answer.   

      Cassie starts to get out when--

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    I know what it s like, Cassie.  To 
                    lose your mom.  Or at least what 
                    it s like to grow up not having 
                    one.

      Cassie turns to her.  Listens.

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    My mom died when I was little.  I 
                    never even knew her.  

                                  CASSIE
                    What happened?

                                  DIANA
                    It s a long story, but I ll tell ya 
                    sometime, just know... 
                          (beat)
                    you re not alone here in New Salem.

      Beat.  As Cassie lets this sink in.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Thanks for the ride, Diana.                                                                                    20.

      CONTINUED:

      Cassie gets out and starts for the house.  

      INT. JANE S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Cassie is filling Jane in on the events of the evening. 

                                  JANE
                    And the car just caught fire?

                                  CASSIE
                    When I turned the ignition.

                                  JANE
                    Maybe you blew the engine on the 
                    drive from Florida?  

                                  CASSIE
                    Maybe.  Maybe, I m losing my mind.  
                    The whole night was weird.  The 
                    kids here.  I m not used to the  
                    small town groove yet.

                                  JANE
                    Well, tomorrow s a new day.

      Cassie nods.  Starts for the foyer but turns.

                                  CASSIE
                    Grandma, do you know my father?

      This makes Jane stop in her tracks.  She looks at Cassie.

                                  JANE
                    Why would you ask that?

                                  CASSIE
                    It s been on my mind, that s all.  
                    Mom said she didn t know him.  She 
                    claimed it was one night and a 
                    bottle of tequila.  Which is fine.  
                    I can accept that.

                                  JANE
                    Better than I can.

      Cassie tries not to tear up.  But this is emotional stuff.

                                  CASSIE
                    I can also accept she was lying.  
                    For whatever reasons.  So if you 
                    know who he might be--                                                                                    21.

      CONTINUED:

                                  JANE
                    Oh honey...

                                  CASSIE
                    You could tell me.  I can take it.

                                  JANE
                    Your mother never told me who he 
                    was, Cassie.  I m sorry.

      Cassie nods.  Appreciates her Grandmother s honesty.  

      INT. NICK S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      MUSIC PLAYS.  As TWO NAKED BODIES go at it, heatedly.  They 
      reach their moment and collapse onto each other.  Beat.  
      Then, the guy rolls out of bed. REVEAL NICK.

                                  NICK
                    Not bad. I give it a 7. There was a 
                    lack of focus in your key moves.

                                  FAYE
                    I give it a 6. You meandered. 

                                  NICK
                    I m getting points deducted for 
                    stamina? There s a first.

      Nick pulls on his shorts. Goes to the window.

                                  FAYE
                    Can you see her over there?

                                  NICK
                    Nope.

      But Nick is lying.  NICK S POV -- he can see directly into 
      Cassie s bedroom.  He watches as she emerges from the 
      bathroom, wearing just a towel.

      INT. CASSIE S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Cassie emerges from the bathroom.  She s just showered.  She 
      has a towel wrapped around her as she brushes her hair.  She 
      moves about her room when she sees her CURTAINS are open.  
      She goes to them.  Sees Nick watching her.

      Cassie pulls the DRAPES closed but not before giving Nick a 
       fuck off  look.                                                                                    22.


      INT. NICK S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

      Nick smiles at Cassie s dissing.  Appreciates it.

                                  NICK
                    You should be more careful with 
                    her.

                                  FAYE
                    Oh please... you sound like Diana.

                                  NICK
                    Diana s not wrong.  She s one of 
                    us, Faye. 

                                  FAYE
                    Diana does things her way, I do 
                    things mine.  Anyway, from what I 
                    saw tonight, Cassie s a waste of 
                    time.  

      Nick doesn t agree.  He continues to stare out the window.

      INT. CASSIE S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

      Cassie digs through a drawer and finds a tee shirt.  She 
      drops her towel and pulls it on, then turns to find--

      THE CURTAINS ARE OPEN AGAIN.

      CASSIE FREEZES. As a chill races down her spine.  But... how?  
      She races to the window.  Sees Nick still staring.  It s 
      beyond eerie.  She pulls the DRAPES CLOSED again.  Confused.  
      Did she close them?  That moment of rational debate. 

      INT. NICK S BEDROOM - NIGHT- CONTINUOUS

      Now, Nick turns away from the window. He smiles at Faye. 

                                  NICK
                    How about I give you a chance to 
                    beat our score?

                                  FAYE
                    Why don t you practice by yourself.

      As Faye gets up, dresses to leave. 

      INT. CASSIE S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Cassie goes to her bed.  It s been a very bizarre and weird 
      day.                                                                                      23.

      CONTINUED:

      A brief moment as she stares at her MOM S PHOTO on the night 
      stand.  She CLICKS off the lamp and crawls under the covers.  

      She lies flat, staring up at the ceiling.  There s something 
      lost and pained about her face.  As she stares at the GLOW-IN- 
      THE-DARK-STARS above her.  She begins to HUM her mother s 
      MELODY when--

      THE STARS BEGIN TO MOVE -- EMERGE MORE PROMINENTLY.

      Cassie audibly GASPS.  She stops HUMMING.  The stars stop 
      moving.  Upon realizing-- 

      She begins to HUM again.  The stars begin to move again.  Or 
      is it an illusion?  Cassie can t tell.  Not sure she s seeing 
      what she thinks she s seeing.  She continues to HUM... 
        nervously... curiously...

      THE STARS BEGIN TO FORM A PATTERN.  It s a SYMBOL.  She 
      stares at it long and hard.  

      Then, suddenly, she leaps up.  Turns on the side lamp.  She 
      gets out of bed and goes to the fire place where she sees the  
      SAME SYMBOL etched in stone.  

      She touches it.  Presses on it.  It moves slightly.  She 
      pulls on it.  The stone moves.  Cassie pulls harder, removing 
      it from the fire place to find--

      A secret hiding place.  She reaches in and pulls out a VERY 
      OLD BOUND BOOK.  Verging on ancient.  It s crammed full of 
      papers, hand-written notes, drawings, pictures, etc.  A 
      record of the last three hundred plus years.  

      On its cover it says -- BLAKE.   

      CLOSE ON THE BOOK -- certain words and phrases are seen.

      Spells... Potions... Herbs... Witchcraft...

      Off Cassie s stunned expression--


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    24.


                                      ACT THREE

      INT. CASSIE S BEDROOM - MORNING

      Shafts of sunlight stream through Cassie s window.  As she 
      sits on the bed with her FAMILY S BOOK.  Her face a mix of 
      curiosity and disbelief.  

      CLOSE ON THE BOOK -- page after page of spells.  Mostly 
        handwritten.  She comes across a picture of her mom and a 
      MAN.  She studies it.  The face is familiar.  (Ethan)  

      She sees writing -- THE CIRCLE, then names after it.  John 
      Conant, Rebecca Meade, Mavis Chamberlain, etc.  

      She continues to peruse the book, fascinated. 

      EXT. FISHERMAN S WHARF - MORNING

      The center of the town.  Where the town dock and boardwalk, 
      and marina create the heart of the town.

      A CELEBRATION is in the works.  A tent is being erected.  A 
      small stage built.  A small town fair.  A sign reads LOBSTER 
      FESTIVAL.  A yearly event.  

      Faye and Melissa are exiting the coffee shop with their 
      caffeine fix when Diana approaches.  

                                  DIANA
                    What was up with that little stunt 
                    last night? 

                                    MELISSA
                    Hi, Diana.  Nice to see you too.

                                  FAYE
                    Why do you just assume I was the 
                    one who did it?

                                    MELISSA
                    Yeah, how do you know it wasn t me?

      Faye rolls her eyes.

                                  FAYE
                    Because you can t flat iron your

                          (to Faye)
                    Did you do it?                                                                                    25.

      CONTINUED:

      Faye shrugs and smiles.  Kind of smugly. 

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    It was stupid and reckless.

                                  FAYE
                    We all wanted to know, Diana.  I 
                    cut to the chase.  What s the big 
                    deal?  No one got hurt.  That s the 
                    rule, right?

                                  DIANA
                    The rule is we don t act alone.  We 
                    don t do anything that could risk 
                    exposure.   

                                  FAYE
                    That s a lot to remember.

      She s fucking with Diana who s not amused.

                                  DIANA
                    Are we going to have a problem?   

                                  FAYE
                    We ve had a problem since the third 
                    grade, why stop now?  

                                  DIANA
                    We all made a pact and if you break 
                    the pact--

                                  FAYE
                    What Diana?  If I break the pact-- 
                    what are you going to do?

      Faye and Diana face off.  It s intense.  

                                  DIANA
                    Don t push it, Faye.

      Off Faye as Diana walks off.   

      INT. JANE S HOUSE - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

      Cassie enters the kitchen.  Looks around.  Sees a note on the 
      fridge.  AT MARINA.  JOIN ME.  With a smiley face.

      Cassie opens her MOM S BOOK.  Reads from it.  

                                  CASSIE
                          (reading)
                    Spell... let s see... boil water.                                                                                     26.

      CONTINUED:

      Cassie has a sense of humor about this.  As she finds a small 
      sauce pot.  She fills it with water and sits it on the stove.  

      She reads more -- 

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                    Water... Fire... 

      Cassie grabs some matches from the stove and lights one.  She 
      holds it in her hand as she recites from the book. 

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                          (reading)
                    Lazerth, ointe, sette, foah...

      Cassie repeats this several times, eyeing the water.  But 
      nothing happens to it.  The match burns to her fingers.  She 
      drops it.  Lights another.  She tries it again.  But still 
      nothing.  Beat.

      Finally, she laughs at herself.  She can t believe she s 
      actually trying to boil water.  She blows the match out, 
      grabs the book, turns to exit when she sees... 

      Dirty dishes in the sink.  And then -- Cassie s eyes widen to 
      discover a glass of water -- SIZZLING.  She reaches down to 
      touch it.  But she already knows -- it s boiling hot. 

      Cassie GASPS, shaken.  A long, sustained moment.  Then Cassie 
      grabs the book and races out.

      INT. BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL - DAY

      Cassie enters the empty tavern, looks around.  Sees no one.  
      They re not open yet.  She hears a NOISE in the back.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Hello?

      She ventures to the back of the bar.  Sees a swinging door.  
      Does she dare?  But before she can decide --

      IT BURSTS OPEN.  Cassie jumps.  As ETHAN CONANT, plows 
      through.  Rugged and worn.  Adam s dad-- the man who was 
      staring at Cassie last night.  He s drunk.  And it s early in 
      the day.  That sums him up.

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  I was looking for 
                    someone.

      Ethan stares at her a moment.  As if he s seen a ghost.                                                                                      27.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ETHAN
                    My god, girl.  You look just like 
                    her.

                                  CASSIE
                    I m sorry?

                                  ETHAN
                    Amelia.  I can see her in you.

      Cassie begins to put it together. 

                                  CASSIE
                    Did you know my mother?

      Beat.  As Ethan nods, full of regret.  

                                  ETHAN
                    Yes, I knew her.

      Ethan heads behind the bar, to pour himself a drink.  Cassie 
      turns to him, wanting to know more.

                                  CASSIE
                    You were friends?

      Ethan looks at her.  How should he answer?  And then-- 

                                  ETHAN
                    That s one way to put it.
                          (then)
                    I loved your mother very much.

      Before Cassie can ask anything else -- Adam enters from the 
      back, carrying cases of beer.  He sees Cassie.  

                                  ADAM
                    Hey, Cassie?  What s up?  

                                  CASSIE
                    I didn t see my car outside... 

                                  ADAM
                    Your grandma came by earlier, had 
                    it towed to the station.

      Oh.  Cassie nods.  That explains it.

                                  ETHAN
                    She s pretty, son.  And I sense a 
                    big heart.  Just like Amelia.  
                          (to Cassie)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    28.

      CONTINUED: (2)
                                  ETHAN (CONT'D)
                    Your mom and me were meant to be 
                      together--

                                  ADAM
                    Okay, dad, you re talking too much.  
                    We gotta open soon.  Why don t you 
                    go clean up?

      Ethan eyes Cassie, intently.  Adam helps him through the 
      swinging door.  Adam looks to Cassie, apologetic.

                                  CASSIE
                    It was nice to meet you, sir.

                                  ADAM
                    Sorry about that.

                                  CASSIE
                    It s okay.  

      Silence.  An awkward tension.  It s felt by both. 

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                    Do you know where Diana is?  

                                  ADAM
                    Did you check the wharf?  The 
                      Festival s today.  

      Cassie nods.  Cassie starts out but stops--

                                  CASSIE
                    Question.  My car last night?  How 
                    did the fire go out?  

                                  ADAM
                    It just went out.  

                                  CASSIE
                    You looked at it and it went out.

                                  ADAM
                    I looked at it when it went out.

                                  CASSIE
                    And how did the doors unlock?

                                  ADAM
                    I dunno.  How did they lock in the 
                    first place?

                                  CASSIE
                    Got it.  Thanks.                                                                                    29.

      CONTINUED: (3)

      An annoyed Cassie starts out.  But now Adam stops her. 

                                  ADAM
                    What do you think happened?

      Cassie turns back -- challenging. 

                                  CASSIE
                    Gee, I don t know.   A shot in the 
                    dark.  Witchcraft?  Seeya later.

      Cassie exits to great effect.  It catches Adam off guard.  He 
      races after her.   

      EXT. BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL - PARKING LOT - DAY

      Adam chases Cassie out the door.  

                                  ADAM
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa... why would you 
                    say that?

                                  CASSIE
                    Why would you chase me out the door 
                    after I said it?  I can play this 
                    game all day.

                                  ADAM
                    I just wanna know why you would go 
                    there.

      Cassie stops.  Turns to him.  She s done talking in circles.

                                  CASSIE
                    And I just wanna know why you re 
                    not being straight with me.  

      Beat.  As Adam studies her face.  

                                  ADAM
                    What is it you think you know?  

      Finally, Cassie unleashes.  

                                  CASSIE
                    The car last night... and other 
                    things.  Something is going on 
                    around here. 

      Adam s not sure how to respond.  Cassie digs in her bag and 
      pulls out her MOTHER S BOOK.                                                                                     30.

      CONTINUED:

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                    I found a book that belonged to my 
                    mom.  About witchcraft.  A spell 
                    book.  She wrote about a secret 
                    circle.  Listed their family names.  
                    Conant, that would be you.  Meade, 
                    that would be Diana, and Faye s 
                    family and Melissa... 

      Adam grabs the book, covers it up, looks around, makes sure 
      no one is watching.  They re alone.  He hands it back to her.

                                  ADAM
                    Put it away.  Before someone sees 
                    it.  

      He s deadly serious.  Cassie s tough wall comes down.  She s 
      at a loss.  This is all too real for her.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Please.  I don t understand.

      Adam sees her fear.  How confused she is.   

                                  ADAM
                    Okay, but not here.

      He starts off, motioning for her to follow him.

      EXT. WOODS - DAY

      Adam leads Cassie down a path in the forest.  Rich and lush.  
      The sun breaks perfectly through the trees, bathing them in 
      shafts of light.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Where are we going?

                                  ADAM
                    Is everything a question with you?

                                  CASSIE
                    Around questionable people. 

                                  ADAM
                    Here we are.

      He leads her to a small clearing.   

                                  CASSIE
                    What s special about this place?                                                                                    31.

                    Nature is important to us.

                                  CASSIE
                    Us?  Are you going to start talking 
                    in creepy  we  speak?  Like a cult?

      He smiles.  Understands her trepidation.

                    You re saying I m a witch.  My mom

                    We just try to keep a straight face

      Cassie catches his implication.                                                                                      32.

                    But we have to keep it secret, 
                    Cassie.  It s forbidden.  Things 
                    got out of hand in the past and the 
                    families decided to abolish all 
                      witchcraft.  They feared modern 
                    times.  Discovery.  Persecution.  
                    Hurting others, themselves.  That s 
                    why you can t tell anyone, Cassie.  
                    Not your grandmother, friends, no 
                    one can know about us.

                                  CASSIE
                    Who would believe me?  I don t 
                    believe it. 

                                  ADAM
                    Sure you do.

                                  CASSIE
                    No, I don t.

      Adam smiles.  Knows better.  

                                  ADAM
                    Yes, you do.  You re already 
                      awakening.  Inside.  You feel it.

      Cassie goes silent.  Yes, she senses something.   

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Come here.  It s okay.  Don t be 
                    afraid.

      She joins him in the center of the field.  Where he has 
      picked up a leaf.  He opens her palms and SETS DOWN THE LEAF.  
      There's water in it and he's careful not to spill any. 

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Close your eyes.
                          (she does)
                      Concentrate on how your hand 
                    connects with the leaf, then how 
                    the leaf connects with the water.

      She tries.  

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Say "a drop of water, as light as 
                    air" and keep repeating it.

                                  CASSIE
                    Shouldn't it rhyme or something?                                                                                    33.

                                  ADAM
                    It's a way to get your brain 
                    focused on what you're trying to 
                    do.  But yes, sometimes it's easier 
                    to remember if it rhymes.  Try it. 

      She closes her eyes again.

                                  CASSIE
                    A drop of water, as light as air.  
                    A drop of water, as light as air.
                          (beat)
                    I can't feel anything.

      He puts his hands under hers.  She can feel his warmth.

                                  ADAM
                    Can you feel tingling where my hand 
                    is touching yours?  It's your 
                    energy connecting to mine. 

      Cassie lets his words sink in.  She concentrates on what 
      she's actually feeling.  She begins to FEEL SOMETHING.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    A drop of water, as light as air...

                                    CASSIE/ADAM
                    A drop of water, as light as air.

      Their voices melt into each other.  Their bodies draw closer 
      together.  The INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM IS INTENSE.  Incredibly, 
      the WATER IN THE LEAF BEGINS TO RISE IN THE AIR.

                                  ADAM
                    Open your eyes.

      She does.  And is AWESTRUCK WHEN SHE SEES THE WATER.  She 
      looks at Adam.  They LOCK EYES and the rest of the world 
      becomes a blur.

      Then all around them, HUNDREDS OF WATER DROPS START TO RISE 
      IN THE AIR.  From the tops of branches and rocks, tree tops 
      and grass.  LIKE FLOATING DIAMONDS, they reflect the orange 
      and red light from the sun.  It's like Cassie and Adam are in 
      a CRYSTAL FOREST.  It's breathtaking.

      CASSIE'S STUNNED.  Her expression is full of wonder.  Tears 
      well up in her eyes.  It could quite possibly be the most 
      beautiful thing she s ever seen.

                                        ACT FOUR

      EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

      Deep in the woods -- sits a huge abandoned house.  Decaying.  
      Overgrown yard.  Ominous.  Adam leads Cassie up the steps.  

                                  CASSIE
                    You re kidding me, right?  You 
                    think I m going in there?

                                  ADAM
                    It just looks creepy.  We usually 
                    meet during the day... since 
                    there s no electricity.

                                  CASSIE
                    There s no lights?  

                                  ADAM
                    Just rats and snakes.  

      Cassie heads the head other way.  He stops her, LAUGHS. 

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    I m joking.

      She can t help but smile.  

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    I like that.  Keep smiling.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Why?

                                  ADAM
                    It s important to keep this all 
                    balanced.  With some humor.  It can 
                    get overwhelming sometimes.  
                          (then)
                    And you have a nice smile.

      Beat.  They look at each other.  They have a connection.  
      It s innocent... but it s there.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    C mon, they re waiting for us.  

      He leads her up the porch steps.                                                                                      35.


      INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

      Candles have been lit.  They illuminate the surroundings.  
      Peeling wallpaper, torn furniture, dust and such...

      Adam and Cassie enter and start up the staircase. 

      INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM -NIGHT

      A large room.  With high arched ceilings.  Broken windows.  

      Candles are everywhere.  Cassie and Adam enter to find --

      Faye and Melissa.  Nick and Doug are outside, on a veranda, 
      smoking a joint.  

                                  ADAM
                    You know Melissa and Faye...

                                  CASSIE
                    Hi.

                                  FAYE
                          (to Adam, suggestive)
                    I m impressed.  I couldn t get a 
                    rise with a burning car, what did 
                    you do?  Wait, let me guess...

      Cassie reacts.  Faye made the fire happen?

                                  DIANA (O.C.)
                    Cassie came to it on her own.  She 
                    found her mother s Book of Shadows.

      Both Melissa and Faye are shocked by the statement.

      Cassie turns to see Diana enter.  She smiles at Cassie.  A 
      warm, comforting smile.  

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    I m glad you re here.

                                    MELISSA
                    Can I see it?

      Cassie withdraws the book.  Melissa takes it and feverishly 
      looks through it.  Faye eyes it too.  Adam explains.

                                  ADAM
                    Our families hid them from us.  So 
                    we wouldn t know who we are.                                                                                    36.

      CONTINUED:

      Cassie doesn t like how Melissa is handling her mom s book. 
      She takes it from her.

                                    MELISSA
                    Diana s the only one who has one.

                                  FAYE
                    Not anymore.

      The pleasure she gets from this new reality isn t lost on 
      Diana.  Adam breaks the moment.  Gives Diana a kiss.

                                  ADAM
                    Thanks for calling everyone.  I 
                    wasn t sure what to do.

      Diana understands.  Cassie looks around.  Sees herbs and pots 
      and all sorts of objects.  It s unsettling.

                                  CASSIE
                    What goes on here?  Is this where 
                    you practice black magic?

                                  DIANA
                    It s not like that.

                                  FAYE
                    No, Diana has lots of rules to make 
                    things less fun.  More wholesome.

                                  DIANA
                    Faye--

      Doug and Nick enter from the deck -- they eye Cassie.  Doug 
      walks straight over to Cassie.  Introduces himself.

                                  DOUG
                    Hi, I m Doug, we haven t met. 

                                  NICK
                    Cassie.  Always a pleasure to see 
                    you.

      He gives her a knowing look.  It makes her uncomfortable.  
      She backs away.  Looks to Diana, then Adam.

                                  CASSIE
                    Listen, I m sorry for getting you 
                    all out here, but I don t think 
                    this is for me.  I m not really 
                    into groups.  Glee clubs, magic 
                    covens, any of them.                                                                                    37.

                    Get over it.  You ve been signed up 
                    for this since before you were 
                    born.  This is who you are.

                                  CASSIE
                    Setting people on fire?  I don t 
                    think so.  My mother left here and 
                    I m starting to guess it s because 
                    she wanted no part of this. 

                                  DIANA
                    What Faye did was a mistake.  

      She glares at Faye.  Silently demanding an apology.

                                  FAYE
                    I meant it as a gentle nudge... But 
                    may have gotten carried away.

      It s not much of an apology.  And Cassie doesn t accept it.  
      Diana tries to answer her fears.  Carefully.

                                  DIANA
                    Your mom... with the rest of our 
                      parents... took things too far.  
                    That s not going to happen with us.  
                    We re careful.  We re still 
                    learning and we re taking things 
                    slowly.

                    Sorry.  You ve got the wrong girl.  

                                  ADAM
                    In the forest... That s who you 
                    are.  I saw it.  We both did.

                                  DIANA
                    No, it s okay.  Take your time.  
                    Think about it.  We re here for 
                    you, Cassie.  We re your friends.                                                                                      39.

      CONTINUED: (4)

                                  CASSIE
                    If you re worried I m gonna tell.  
                    I won t.  I ll keep your secret, 
                    but I don t want any part of it.

      And with that Cassie takes her FAMILY BOOK and exits.   Adam 
      looks to Diana.  Faye simmers.  

      EXT. THE WHARF/MAIN STREET - NIGHT

      The Festival is underway.  The entire town of New Salem has 
      turned out for it.  PEOPLE line the streets and sidewalks.  
      Lights have been strung from building to building.  

      Carnival games and food stands line the wharf as PEOPLE dance 
      in the street to a LIVE BAND.

      EXT. WHARF - FESTIVAL - NIGHT

      Vice-Principal Dawn Chamberlain is manning the CLAM CHOWDER 
      TENT when Jane Blake approaches.  

                                  JANE
                    Hello, Dawn.

                                  DAWN
                    Jane.  How are you?

                                  JANE
                    A little concerned, actually.

      Dawn moves closer.  So they can talk privately.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    It s Cassie.  Her car caught fire 
                    last night.  

      Dawn pauses upon hearing this.  It s news to her.

                                  DAWN
                    Is she okay?

                                  JANE
                    She s fine.  It s what caused the 
                    fire I m concerned about.

                                  DAWN
                    What did?

                                  JANE
                    We don t know.  
                          (beat)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    40.

      CONTINUED:
                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I seem to recall a similar thing 
                    happening years ago.  Some 
                    teenagers having fun.  You 
                    included.

      Dawn sees where she s going with this.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Are the children practicing?  

      Dawn s face falls some.

                                  DAWN
                    It s impossible.  They don t even 
                    know the history.  It s too buried. 

                                  JANE
                    They re teenagers, Dawn.  You 
                    better than anyone, would know how 
                      resourceful they can be. 

      Dawn takes this extremely serious.

                                  DAWN
                    I m the Vice Principal, I m around 
                    these kids every day.  If they were 
                      practicing, I would know.

                                  JANE
                    Would you?  Maybe, we ve gotten too 
                    lax.  It is conceivable.  They 
                    could be doing it in secret.

                                  DAWN
                    How would they know what to do?  
                    They wouldn t even know where to 
                    start. 

                                  JANE
                    Cassie s an innocent.  Amelia told 
                    her nothing.  I want to keep it 
                    that way. 

                                  DAWN
                    I ll keep my eyes open, but it s 
                    not possible.  I assure you.  

      But Dawn can t help but be suspicious.  She shares Jane s 
      concern.                                                                                      41.


      EXT. STREET DANCE - NIGHT

      The road has been blocked off for a street dance.  A band 
      plays.  As a crowd dances and parties under the stars. 

      Through the crowd, the CIRCLE appears.  Diana, Adam, Faye, 
      Melissa, Nick, Doug -- they lock eyes on Cassie who is 
      walking through the sights with Jane.  

      EXT. WHARF - ARTS TENT - NIGHT

      Cassie and Jane.  

                                  JANE
                    So what do you think of our town?  
                    Are you making friends? 

                                  CASSIE
                    A few.  It takes time. 

                                  JANE
                    If I leave early will you be okay?  

      Cassie smiles.  Of course, she can.  Just then, Faye comes up 
      behind Cassie and steals her away.

                                  FAYE
                    She s in good hands, Mrs. Blake.  
                    I ll get her home safely.  

      Faye pulls Cassie away, playfully.

      EXT. BOARDWALK - NIGHT

      Adam steals Diana away from the others for a private moment.

                                  DIANA
                    Where are we going?

                                  ADAM
                    There s something I need to tell 
                    you.

      Diana eyes him.  Yes?

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    In the woods.  When I showed Cassie 
                    the spell.  I felt her energy.  

                                  DIANA
                    And?                                                                                    42.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ADAM
                    She s different, Diana.  Stronger.  
                    Unlike anything I ve felt.  There s 
                    something special about her.  

                                  DIANA
                    What do you mean?  

                                  ADAM
                    I don t know what I mean.  I just 
                    thought I should tell you.  

      Diana nods, of course.  But it only confuses her.  

      EXT. GAME TENTS - FESTIVAL - NIGHT

      At the FOOTBALL TOSS, Nick and Doug toss balls.  Melissa, 
      Faye, and Cassie watch.  Doug keeps winning.  Finally, Nick 
      steps aside.  He sidles up next to Cassie, all friendly.

                                  NICK
                    I get your resistance, Cassie.  I 
                    hold the loner crown.  But this 
                    little group works for me.  And I 
                    don t even like  em. 
                          (smiles, then)
                    You don t wanna be in it alone.  

      Faye pulls Cassie away.  Enough.

                                  FAYE
                    Way to sell it.  There s a car 
                      dealership in your future. 
                          (to Cassie)
                    Let s just have some fun.

      Faye leads Cassie off alone.  They stop and peruse a stand of 
      HAND CRAFTED JEWELRY.  Faye places several pieces on Cassie.   

                                  FAYE (CONT D)
                    Dreck.  Dreck.  This too.  Arts and 
                    crafts should be outlawed.

      They LAUGH.  Faye is being her most  endearing  self.  

                                  CASSIE
                    I know what you guys are doing.  

                                  FAYE
                    Is it working?

                                  CASSIE
                    Maybe... a little.                                                                                    43.

      CONTINUED:

                                  FAYE
                    The night s young.

      Cassie holds up a bulky turquoise necklace.

                                  CASSIE
                    What about this?

                                  FAYE
                    If you re going for hideous. 

                                  SALLY (V.O.)
                    I made that one.

      They turn to find Sally behind them.  Stone-faced.  It s her 
      booth.  Cassie removes it, doesn t want to be rude.

                                  CASSIE
                    Hi, Sally.  It s nice, just too big 
                    for my neck.  

                                  FAYE
                    It s okay, Cassie, she knows it s 
                    ugly.  It s obvious, right?  

                                  SALLY
                    I had you in mind when I made it.

                                  FAYE
                    Ouch.  Almost.

      Faye walks away, tugs at Cassie to join her.  Who does so, 
        apologetically.  They move through the crowd, coming upon--

      Diana and Adam -- and an OLDER MAN who is now with them.   

                                  DIANA
                    Hey, there you are.  I want you to 
                    meet my Dad.    

      Diana s father, THOMAS MEADE, 40, greets Cassie. 

                                  THOMAS
                    Hi, Cassie, welcome to New Salem.  

      Thomas is an attractive man.  With piercing blue eyes.  Pale 
      skin.  Eerie beautiful.  He looks extremely familiar.  But 
      not to Cassie.  She has no idea THIS IS THE MAN WHO KILLED 
      HER MOTHER.  


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    44.


                                        ACT FIVE

      EXT. WHARF - NIGHT

      Right where we left off.  Diana s father.  

                                  THOMAS
                    Are you kids having fun?  How about 
                    you, Cassie?   Are they treating 
                    you okay? 

                                  CASSIE
                    Yes, sir. 

                                  THOMAS
                    And I m sorry about your loss.  I 
                    knew your mom growing up.  She was 
                    a great woman.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Thank you, Mr. Meade.

                                  THOMAS
                    You kids stay out of trouble.  

      Diana s father walks off into the crowd.  Cassie turns to the 
      others -- says her good-byes.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Well, I think I m gonna go.  Seeya 
                    around, guys.  

                                  DIANA
                    I ll give you a ride.

                                  CASSIE
                    It s okay, I can get home.  

      Cassie walks away.  Faye looks at Diana.  

                                  FAYE
                    Well, you handled that well.  

      Faye walks off.  

      EXT. WHARF - FESTIVAL - NIGHT

      Faye pushes through the crowd when Nick approaches.   

                                  NICK
                    Hey, wanna get drunk?                                                                                     45.

      CONTINUED:

                                  FAYE
                    Go away.

                                  NICK
                    Why are you so angry?

                                  FAYE
                      Disgruntled youth.  No father 
                    figure, domineering mother, bad sex 
                    life, take your pick.  

                                  NICK
                    Thanks for getting me in there.

                                  FAYE
                    Anytime.

      Faye turns to go and CRASHES into Sally.  

                                  SALLY
                    Excuse you.  

      Sally s a little snotty for Faye s taste.  Sally walks on.  
      Faye turns and watches her go, quietly WHISPERING something 
      to herself.  It s inaudible.  

      ON SALLY as she moves through the crowd.  Suddenly, a WOMAN 
      BUMPS into her.  Then, a MAN does the same thing. 

                                  WOMAN
                    Excuse you.

                                  MAN
                    Excuse you. 

      Then, a TEENAGED BOY does it.  Then, a SMALL GIRL.  It 
      happens repeatedly as Sally makes her way all the way through 
      the crowd.  Faye can t help but smile.  Until she sees Diana 
      watching her.  

      Their eye lock says it all.  Finally, Faye turns and walks 
      away.  But Diana catches up to her.  

                                  DIANA
                    Are you just asking to get found 
                    out? 

                                  FAYE
                    Screw you.

                                  DIANA
                    I m done.  You re out.                                                                                      46.

      CONTINUED: (2)

                                  FAYE
                    You can t kick me out. 

                                  DIANA
                    I just did. 

                                  FAYE
                    You don t own the circle.

      Diana starts to walk past her, but Faye blocks her.

                                  DIANA
                    You don t want to pick a fight with 
                    me, Faye.  I m stronger than you.

                                  FAYE
                    Why?  Because you have a precious 
                    Book of Shadows?  Well, I ve been 
                      practicing, Diana, on my own.  
                    You d be surprised at what I can 
                    do.

                                  DIANA
                    You re out of control.  

                                  FAYE
                    You haven t seen out of control.  

      Faye turns and marches off.  Diana stares after her, worried.  
      Slowly, the CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to REVEAL Dawn Chamberlain 
      watching from a distance.  Suspicious of what just 
      transpired.

      EXT. FESTIVAL - BEER BUST - NIGHT

      There s a beer tent where the adults hang and drink.  Cassie 
      walks around it, to avoid the crowd when a FIGURE STUMBLES 
      from behind the tent.  It s Ethan (Adam s Dad).  Cassie 
      jumps, startled.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Hey, Mr. Conant.

      He looks at her drunkenly, stumbling some more.

                                  ETHAN
                    It s... Amelia s girl.

      Cassie nods.

                                  CASSIE
                    Hi, Mr. Conant.  You okay?                                                                                    47.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ETHAN
                    I haven t been okay in many years.  
                    Not since I lost your mother.  

                                  CASSIE
                    What do you mean?

      Ethan gets lost in a drunken memory.  As he talks THOMAS 
      MEADE appears behind Cassie -- he OVERHEARS Ethan.

                                  ETHAN
                    Our families are aligned in the 
                    stars.  We were meant to love each 
                    other.  Just like you and Adam...

      Cassie pauses.  She s not sure she heard correctly.

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    But then your father came along... 
                    just swept her off her feet.

                                  CASSIE
                    You knew my father?

      Ethan bends down, reaches for his drink.

                                  ETHAN
                    Oh yeah, I knew your father--

                                  THOMAS
                    Evening, Ethan.  

      Thomas quickly injects himself.  

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    You need some help home?

                                  ETHAN
                    I can get there, Tommy.  

      He waves Thomas off and starts out.  Cassie doesn t want him 
      to go but also knows he s extremely drunk.  

                                  CASSIE
                    I ll see you soon, Mr. Conant.

      Ethan MUMBLES as he disappears.  Thomas looks at Cassie.  

                                  THOMAS
                    That man can sure drink.                                                                                    48.


      EXT. TOWN DOCK - NIGHT

      Faye moves down to the end of the dock.  She looks out at the 
      dark horizon.  She looks up to the sky.  

                                  FAYE
                    Please sky, quench my thirst.  
                    Please sky, quench my thirst.

      Faye stands there, CHANTING... 

      As RAINDROPS begin to hit the water around the dock.  

      As CLOUDS FORM IN THE SKY ABOVE.  In moments, a light shower 
      becomes a steady pour of rain.

      Faye OPENS HER EYES and looks around.  Stunned by her own 
      power.

      EXT. WHARF - FESTIVAL - NIGHT

      As it begins to RAIN DOWN on the Festival.  Everyone begins 
      to run for cover.  It s a full on DOWN POUR.  

      Cassie races for cover when she looks to the water -- sees 
      Faye standing at the end of the dock -- in a trance.  

      EXT. WHARF - NIGHT

      As PEOPLE duck for cover, Diana comes upon Adam.  

                                  ADAM
                    What s going on?

                                  DIANA
                    I don t know.  

      Off their worried faces--

      EXT. TOWN DOCK - NIGHT

      Cassie races down the dock, shielding herself from the rain.  
      She reaches Faye -- she s almost trance-like.  Cassie begins 
      to realize what s happening.  It frightens her.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Faye... Faye...
                          (beat)
                    Are you doing this?  

      Faye turns to Cassie -- full of wonder and disbelief.  She 
      smiles.  Yes, I am.  This frightens Cassie.                                                                                      49.

      CONTINUED:

                                  FAYE
                    Don t be afraid.  It s beautiful.  
                    Here.  Gimme your hand.

      Faye GRABS Cassie s hand.  Cassie can t help but feel the 
      energy move through her.

      A CRACKLING OF THUNDER.  Followed by LIGHTNING illuminating 
      the sky.  Both girls watch in amazement -- as the rain pours 
      down, drenching them.

      ON THE HORIZON

      Lightning STRIKES DOWN in the distance.  Both beautiful and 
        frightening.

      Cassie gets scared -- she tries to break her grip but Faye 
      holds her close.  

      Just then, Diana battles the rain and races down the dock.

                                  DIANA
                    Faye -- stop it.  

      Diana grabs Faye -- shakes her.  

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    Stop it.  

      Faye looks at her--

      Suddenly, a BOLT OF LIGHTNING STRIKES A BOAT TIED TO THE 
      DOCK.

      It CRACKS the mast -- it comes SMASHING DOWN ON THE DOCK.  

      RIGHT AT DIANA -- KNOCKING HER INTO THE WATER.  

      Cassie SCREAMS, pulling away from Faye -- breaking her from 
      her spell.  She goes for Diana -- but Adam is there.  He 
      dives in and quickly helps Diana to the docks.

      As Faye SNAPS out of her spell, terrified at what she s done.

      OFF CASSIE -- even more so.


                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    50.


                                        ACT SIX

      EXT. WHARF - FESTIVAL - NIGHT

      The RAIN has subsided.  And so has the Festival.  The CROWD 
      has thinned out.  The MUSIC has stopped.  

      Cassie and Adam sit with a wet and shivering Diana.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Are you going to be okay?

      Faye approaches, hesitantly.  Tears in her eyes.  

                                  FAYE
                    I m sorry, Diana.  I would never 
                    hurt you.

      Diana cuts her a look of raw anger.

                                  FAYE (CONT D)
                    I don t know what happened.  It got 
                    out of control.  I touched Cassie.  
                    The energy got too big.

      Adam cuts a look at Diana.  Cassie?  

                                  DIANA
                    Let s talk about this tomorrow.  I 
                    just wanna get home.  

      Adam helps her up. 

                                  ADAM
                    C mon, I ll take you.  

      They all gather to leave, except Faye -- she s unable to 
      move.  She s too full of regret.  

      INT. BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL - LATE NIGHT

      The tavern is empty.  Dark.  The party is long over.  Just 
      the drunken form of Ethan Conant as he reaches for his drink.  
      He has trouble steadying it in his hands.   

      Behind him, the door opens.  A FIGURE APPEARS.  Ethan turns.

                                  ETHAN
                    We re closed.  

      But then, THOMAS MEADE comes into view.  Beat.                                                                                      51.

      CONTINUED:

                                  THOMAS
                    We have a problem, Ethan.  You re 
                    ruining things for me.

                                  ETHAN
                    Huh?  What?  

      A drunken Ethan stares at him, confused. 

                                  THOMAS
                    You drink too much, which makes you 
                    talk too much.  And I can t have 
                    that.  

                                  ETHAN
                    What the hell you doing here?

                                  THOMAS
                    What would happen if you slipped 
                    and fell off that dock outside? You 
                    would drown.  No one would find 
                    your body for days.

      Ethan stares at him.  

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    You know what drowning is like?  
                    That feeling of not being able to 
                      breathe... grasping for air...

      Ethan begins to GAG... COUGH... CHOKE... he can no longer 
      breathe.  He falls over, unable to find air.  Just then, he 
      COUGHS UP WATER... it pours from his mouth.

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    You panic as your lungs fill up 
                    with water.  It s a horrible death.

      Thomas has spelled Ethan.  He s DROWNING.  Ethan s eyes roll 
      back, he falls back against the bar.  Thomas watches as Ethan 
      takes his last breath.  His eyes as cold as death.   

      EXT. JANE S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Jane s house looks peaceful in the moonlight.

      INT. JANE S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Cassie enters to find Jane sleeping on the couch.  She pauses 
      for a beat, wanting to wake her grandmother, talk to her, ask 
      her advice...                                                                                      52.

      CONTINUED:

      But she can t.  She made a promise.  Cassie turns and goes up 
      the stairs.

      INT. CASSIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Cassie enters her room, drops her backpack on the bed.  

      She slides the Book of Shadows from her backpack, then looks 
      up to find Nick at his window.  

      Nick holds a piece of paper up to the window.  Cassie walks 
      over to read:  R U OK? 

      A beat as Nick and Cassie look at each other.  Touched, 
      Cassie nods.  She s okay.  Nick smiles quietly, moves away 
      from the window.

      A beat, then Cassie returns to the Book of Shadows.  It s 
      time to return it to its hiding place.  She moves to the 
      fireplace, then glances over her shoulder to the window.

      The drape is closed.  Cassie smiles.

      She removes the tile on the fireplace, revealing the hidden 
        compartment.  As she puts the Book of Shadows away, her hand 
      settles on a SMALL ENVELOPE tucked at the back of the 
        compartment.  

      She pulls it out, sees  Cassie  written in her mother s 
        handwriting.  

      AS Cassie stares at the envelope--

      INT. CHAMBERLAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

      Dawn puts a kettle on the stove, reaches for the knob to turn 
      on the gas burner.  

      But before she can even touch it, the BURNER FLAMES TO LIFE.

      Instead of reacting with fear, Dawn just turns... to find 
      Thomas, standing behind her.

                                  DAWN
                    You and your tricks.

                                  THOMAS
                    They come in handy.

                                  DAWN
                    Ethan?                                                                                    53.

                    Good.  We were right to bring her 
                    here.  She s got the gift.

                                  THOMAS
                          (yes, she does)
                    She s her father s daughter.

                                  DAWN
                      Unfortunately, she s her mother s 
                    daughter too.

                                  THOMAS
                    Are you sure you can get Cassie to 
                    do what we need?   

                                  DAWN
                    I don t have to get her to do a

                      everything... without even knowing 
                    it.

      OFF Dawn and Thomas, plotting--

      INT. CASSIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Cassie sits on her bed, her mother s letter on her lap. 

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    My sweet Cassie.  You finding this 
                    means I'm gone and for that I am so 
                    sorry.  I didn't want you to have 
                    this life.  I didn't want it for 
                    myself either, but destiny's not 
                    easy to avoid...

      INT. ADAM S CAR - NIGHT

      Adam is parked in front of Diana s house.  They re kissing 
      good-night.  Beat.  As Diana gets a TEXT MESSAGE.  

                                  DIANA
                    It s Cassie.

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    I thought keeping you in the dark 
                    would keep you safe, but all I ve 
                    done is left you unprotected...                                                                                    54.


      EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

      Faye stands at the dock where Diana was hit.  Still stunned 
      by the havoc she unleashed.  She gets a TEXT MESSAGE.

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    As daunting as the truth may be, 
                    hiding from it is far more 
                      dangerous. 

      INT. NICK S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Nick finishes rolling a joint.  He goes to light it when he 
      gets a TEXT MESSAGE.

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    You have incredible power inside 
                    you.  I wish I d helped you 
                    discover it. 

      EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

      A camp fire BURNS in the night.  The surf rages in the 
      distance.  FIGURES comes into view.  Melissa, Doug, Nick, 
      Adam, Faye, Diana -- they take their place around the fire.

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    I hope you find someone who can.

      As they begin to CHANT... 

                                  ALL
                    Take the flame into the night, take 
                    the flame into the night...

      Over and over again -- until the FLAMES of the campfire 
      EXPLODE into the sky -- at least twenty feet.  

      The FLICKERING FLAMES illuminate their surprised faces.  
      CASSIE APPEARS on the edge of the circle. 

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    I ran.  Don t make the same 
                    mistake.  Find a place where you 
                    belong.  A place that gives you the 
                    strength to believe in yourself.  

      CLOSE ON CASSIE

      As she takes her place amongst them, completing the CIRCLE.
