      CLOSE ON-- A BOY'S FACE, eyes closed.  He looks angelic,
      peaceful.  This is JACOB (8, CAUCASIAN).  We widen a little
      to REVEAL--

      He's lying on the ground somewhere.  Sounds of nature --
      birds, insects.  He's wearing a BASEBALL JERSEY that says:
      Springfield Cardinals.  Whoever they are.

      Then-- his eyes POP open at the same time the upper half of
      his body lurches forward, as he takes a HUGE, primal, almost
      violent gasp of air-- as if he's been underwater and just
      came up.  He continues to breathe for several beats, labored,
      sitting up now.

      Breathing more evenly now, he tries to get his bearings. 
      Looks around at-- the tall grasses around him.  He seems to
      have no idea where he is.  He notices-- his sneakers are
      wet.  Why?  He hears a noise.  Turns to see--

      An animal.  An ox, to be exact.  Though it's likely Jacob's
      never seen an ox in his life.  The ox stares at him a beat,
      mildly curious, then starts drinking from a puddle of WATER.

      CLOSE ON: Jacob.  As if he's remembering something about
      water... fear taking over his expression.  SFX: rushing water
      as if running through his mind...

      WIDE SHOT-- Jacob's in the middle of nowhere.  Nothing but
      1000's of acres of farmland and rice paddies all around.  As
      the sound of RUSHING WATER builds in intensity and volume
      until it's deafening we're-- 


      CHYRON: Heilongjiang Province, China.

      A bustling marketplace.  An OX CART passes by.  Salesmen
      hawk their wares-- various animal carcases dangle from hooks;
      BAGS of RICE, etc.  The people wear conical Asian hats and
      speak in Chinese.  NO ONE SPEAKS ENGLISH.

      A CHINESE COUPLE (50's) walks down the dirt road, carrying
      bags, laughing at a shared joke.  The woman suddenly stops
      when she sees--

      Jacob.  Standing in the road.  Exhausted.  Dirty.  

                                      CHINESE WOMAN
                          (in Chinese; worried)
                    Are you alright?

      Jacob just looks at her with plaintive but tired eyes, trying
      to keep standing.

                                      CHINESE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                          (in Chinese)
                    Are you lost?  Do you need help?                                                                                        2.

      With great effort Jacob opens his mouth, tries to speak.

                                      CHINESE MAN
                          (in Chinese)
                    What?  What is it?

      Jacob finally manages to utter--

                                      JACOB
                    Is she... dead?

      And before he has a chance to get an answer or we can
      conjecture who "she" may be-- his eyes roll back into his
      head and-- as he collapses to the ground, we CUT TO BLACK.

      A CHYRON APPEARS ON THE BLACK SCREEN: "The Returned."

                                                                            END TEASER.                                                                                        3.

                                        ACT ONE


      Bellamy's car pulls up to the building, next to a sign that
      we can see: "Health and Human Services - Adoptive Care."


      Still and peaceful-- the lush tranquility of a small town,
      tree-lined road.  Birds sing the song of middle-American
      values as a few leaves fall, heralding the coming of autumn. 
      A few BOYS ride by on bikes.  

      But even now we may sense something sad-- the slightest hint
      of loss-- seeping through the cracks of the picture perfect
      exterior of this place.  We favor one of the houses on the
      street--


      The house oozes with charm.  It was built in the 1860's using
      techniques and materials long abandoned in favor of expediency
      and cost-effectiveness.  It is mostly well-kept, but if you
      look closer you might notice the peeling paint around the
      attic windows, or the broken step leading up the side entrance
      to the kitchen.  We begin to make out the conversation coming
      from inside--

                                      LUCILLE (O.S.)
                      Perspicuous.

                                      HAROLD (O.S.)
                      Repetitive?

                                      LUCILLE (O.S.)
                    Nope.                                                                                        10.


      Harold opens the door.  Is surprised to see-- Bellamy (who
      still wears his ICE JACKET.)  For his part, Bellamy's
      surprised to see a man in his 60's.  Bellamy notices-- a
      MAILBOX with the name: "Garland."

                                      BELLAMY
                    Mr. Garland?                                                                                        11.

      The sun gleams in Harold's eyes.  He holds his hand up to
      shade the light.  Harold gets a look at Bellamy, is
      immediately wary of this official, big-city-looking outsider.

                                      HAROLD
                    I've been called worse.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Are you the only Mr. Garland who
                    lives here?

                                      HAROLD
                    Far as I know.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Father of Jacob?

                                      HAROLD
                          (eyes narrowing)
                    What's this about?

                                      BELLAMY
                    I'm Agent Martin Bellamy, Customs
                    and Immigration Enforcement Agency. 
                    Did your son go missing, Mr. Garland?

                                      HAROLD
                          (getting impatient)
                    Why?

                                      BELLAMY
                    Because I have him.  He's okay.

                                      HAROLD
                          (chuckles)
                    Well, now.  That would be fairly
                    unlikely considering my son died
                    thirty years ago.

      Bellamy reacts: WTF?

                                      BELLAMY
                    I'm very sorry, Mr. Garland.  There's
                    obviously been a mistake--

      A NOISE.  Jacob appears, his head between the bannister
      railings.

      Harold squints, holding his hand over his eyes again.  He
      sees-- Jacob, peeking from between the railings.  Doesn't
      recognize him.  Harold looks at him quizzically--

                                      HAROLD
                    Hello, there.

                                      JACOB
                          (to Harold)
                    What's green and red and goes a
                    million miles an hour?                                                                                        12.

      Bellamy reacts: this is the first time Jacob's spoken.  He
      looks up at-- Harold, who's suddenly in shock.

      Because that's when it hits Harold.  He just stares at the
      boy.  His brain feverishly trying to reconcile the impossible
      reality of Jacob's presence.  As if he's seeing his dead
      son.

      Bellamy watches, utterly confused--

                                      JACOB (CONT'D)
                    Frog in a blender.

                                      HAROLD
                    Oh, God...

                                      LUCILLE (O.S.)
                    Harold?  Is that Fred?

      Harold's reaction to seeing Jacob is enough to signal to
      Jacob that Harold recognizes him.  Jacob runs up the stairs,
      grabs hold of Harold's leg--

                                      JACOB
                    Daddy!

      Harold's legs almost give out from the shock.  He braces
      himself against the doorframe.

                                      HAROLD
                    No...

      Lucille comes to the door--

                                      LUCILLE
                    Harold, who is it?

      Harold looks at her, his face pale.  His eyes empty caverns. 
      She looks down at Jacob.  Jacob turns, looks up at her. 
      Doesn't recognize her--

                                      JACOB
                    Who are you?

      Terror registers in Lucille's eyes.

      Bellamy reacts.  Lucille takes a step back, getting weak-
      kneed.  Bellamy instinctively steps forward to help her.

                                      LUCILLE
                    Jacob?

      A hint of recognition in Jacob's eyes.  And that's it. 
      Lucille's eyes flutter as-- LUCILLE'S POV-- the room spins
      with terrifying, accelerating speed until we--

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                        13.

                                        ACT TWO


      Establishing, we get a sense of the town center here.  A few
      couples walk through town, antiquing, brunching, etc.  Sunday
      drivers pass by lazily.  We favor A CAR that drives up to
      the diner, parks.

      IN THE CAR, A radio plays.  CLOSE ON-- A CELL PHONE VIBRATING
      inside a purse.  REVEAL--

      GAIL GARLAND (30ish, tough, attractive, smart with an
      inquistive nature), in the driver's seat.  She doesn't hear
      the phone over the music.  She sings along to the music
      unconsciously (Doobie Brothers or the like)...

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                      "Whoa-oh-oh, listen to the music..."

      She catches herself, turns off the radio realizing--

                                    GAIL GARLAND (CONT'D)
                    I hate this song.                                                                                        17.


      CLOSE ON-- A BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.  REVEAL-- a younger SHERIFF
      FRED (early 30's), standing with a very young GAIL (6). 
      Fred points to a spot in the river, presumably where Barbara
      died.  CLOSE ON-- little Gail.  Looking at the spot.  Trying
      to imagine her mother.  Trying to conceive of death.  She
      tosses the Bouquet into the river.  As it floats downsteam--


      EXTREME CLOSE-UP ON-- AN EYE.  It moves left and right with
      an eerie smoothness.  Because-- it's not human.  REVEAL--
      It's the eye a G.I. JOE DOLL, held by Jacob.

                                      JACOB (O.S.)
                    Like this.

      REVEAL-- Tom and Jacob play with Jacob's G.I. Joe doll (they
      were 12-inch action figures back then, with "eagle eye
      vision." This hi-tech innovation meant you could move the
      eyes when a lever in the back of the head was moved.)

                                      JACOB (CONT'D)
                    Just move the lever and he can see--
                    even at night.

                                    TOM
                    Wish I had one.                                                                                        29.

      Jacob can see Tom's sad--

                                      JACOB
                    Wanna take it home with you tonight?

                                    TOM
                          (excited)
                    Really?

      It was a simple act of kindness Tom's remembered for 32 years.

                                      JACOB (O.S.)
                    Are you a Priest?


      A car pulls up.  Elaine gets out, heads inside to--


      A SIGN on a BUILDING READS: "County Records Office."  Bellamy
      stands with A CLERK (Female, 40's, Asian, overweight, dour). 
      She's got a huge KEY RING, stands in front of the door. 
      Bellamy's in a bit of a tussle with her--

                                      BELLAMY
                    I don't care about your protocol. 
                    This is a federal investigation--
                    are you gonna let me in or not--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Agent Bellamy.
                          (he turns)
                    I wanna help.

      Off Bellamy--


      Bellamy and Gail talk, away from the Clerk.

                                      BELLAMY
                    And your father knew nothing about
                    Jacob's version of things?  The bald
                    man?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    No.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Well, it's an interesting story. 
                    Not sure it sheds much light on who--
                    or what-- Jacob is.

      But Gail's been thinking about this.  On the other hand...

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    If we want to know the truth about
                    Jacob, seems to me the best place to
                    start is the day he died.

                                      BELLAMY
                          (considers, then--)
                    Okay.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    One more thing.  I'd appreciate it
                    if we could keep my involvement in
                    this between us.

                                      BELLAMY
                          (guessing)
                    Not everybody's as eager to dig up
                    the past as you?                                                                                        33.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Something like that.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Sure.  Let's go.
                          (re: Clerk)
                    But be careful, that one bites.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Tina?  She's a sweetheart.

      Tina smiles at Gail.  Bellamy gives her a nasty look as they
      head into--


      Fred and the Nurse have been looking all around, are just
      giving up.  Fred's on his phone, pacing--

                                    FRED (INTO PHONE)
                    He's gone... I don't know, 20 minutes? 

      A DISCHORDANT MUSICAL CUE RISES AND WE--

      PULL BACK, farther and farther with a VERY LONG LENS until
      we're in-- the woods.  The sense we're in someone's POV, and
      Sheriff Fred is being watched.  Because we are.

      REVERSE ANGLE, REVEALING-- The Disheveled Man from the
      busstop.  Is he coming for Jacob?  Already gotten him?

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                        39.

                                        ACT FIVE


      CONNOR'S POLICE CAR slowy cruises.  IN THE CAR, Connor drives
      while talking into his RADIO.  Harold sits shotgun, looking
      out the window for Jacob, tense--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT (INTO RADIO)
                    ...We're heading south on Dover,
                    just north of the Garland's house. 
                    Clear so far--

                                      HAROLD
                    Stop!  
                          (Connor stops)
                    There he is.


      Connor and Harold hop out of the car.

                                      HAROLD
                    Jacob!

      Jacob, in the deep b.g., stops.  Looks back at them.  A beat. 
      Then he turns towards the woods.  He seems torn.  Then, some
      force compelling him, he makes his choice, runs away from
      Harold and Connor towards the woods--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    Where's he going?  What's back there?

                                      HAROLD
                    Nothin'.  Nothin' but woods and... 

      Harold looks at Connor.

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    What?

                                      HAROLD
                    The river.

      Shit.  They run after him--


      A few cuts of Connor and Harold running after Jacob, who's
      well off in the distance--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    Jacob!

      Jacob runs with determination, purpose.

      CONNOR flies ahead of Harold, as Jacob takes a turn behind
      the house, disappearing from view--                                                                                        40.

                                      CONNOR CUPIT (CONT'D)
                    Jacob!

      WITH HAROLD.  Up ahead, Connor disappears from view behind
      the house.  Harold, exhausted, stops to catch his breath. 
      Has to lean over, supporting himself with hands on knees,
      the action triggering a MEMORY HIT--


      We're in a TRACKING SHOT, following Jacob (8), running with
      a football as fast as he can, laughing.  The feeling is
      idyllic, pastoral.

      REVEAL-- Harold (30's, athletic, spry, full of energy) running
      after Jacob.  Effortlessly, he catches up to the boy, scoops
      the laughing Jacob up in his arms.  Back to--


      Harold, still catching his breath--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT (O.S.)
                          (calling in distance)
                    Jacob!

      Harold gathers strength, starts running again--


      Connor's at the edge of the woods, looking around.  Harold
      appears.

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    He's gone.

      They look into the woods.  Could they have lost him that
      fast?  Then Harold sees movement by an ANCIENT TREE.

                                      HAROLD
                    Jacob!

      Jacob's reaching into a HOLE in the trunk of the old tree. 
      As if digging for something.  More spooky behavior.  Harold
        approaches--

                                      HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    What're you doing, boy?

      He doesn't respond.  They come closer, tension mounting.  

                                      HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    What you lookin' for in there?

      Jacob keeps digging, determined.  Then he pulls something
      out of the tree--                                                                                        41.

                                      JACOB
                          (big smile)
                    He's here!

      He triumphantly holds up a 30-year-old tattered, broken G.I.
      JOE DOLL.  He wasn't going to the river at all.  He just
      wanted his doll.  Harold stares at the doll, another memory--


      A 1978 PORSCHE 911 pulls into the driveway, driver-side window
      open.  REVEAL-- the driver is Harold (30's).  He looks up at--
      the WHITE COLONIAL HOUSE.

                                      JACOB
                    Daddy!

      Jacob's outside the car window.  Jacob opens the driver's
      side door from the outside.

                                      HAROLD
                    Hey, Monkey!

      Jacob hugs him.  Harold grabs-- a PAPER BAG, sitting on the
      passenger seat.

                                      HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Hold on, now.  I got somethin' for
                    you.  Back up, go on.

      As Jacob gets out of the car, and Harold follows--

                                      JACOB
                    What is it?

      Harold steps of the car and we now see he's wearing-- AN
      EXPENSIVE SUIT.  He's perfectly groomed, in stark contrast
      to the man in present day.  He hands Jacob the bag--

                                      HAROLD
                    Happy birthday.

      Jacob opens it, pulls out-- the G.I. Joe Doll.

                                      JACOB
                    G.I. Joe!  Awesome!  Mommy!  Look
                    what Daddy got me!

      Jacob runs to the open front door where Jacob joins Lucille
      (30's).  Harold watches Jacob and Lucille, smiling--


                                      JACOB
                    It's Joe!

      Harold's face turns stern, as if Jacob's voice had rudely
      awaken him from a dream--                                                                                        42.

                                      HAROLD
                    That's his.  That's my son's.

      Connor looks at Harold, surprised by his harshness.  Jacob
      is, too.  He starts to put the doll back in the tree--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    That's okay, Jacob.  You can have
                    it.
                          (to Harold)
                    Right?

      Connor looks at Harold, who catches himself.

                                      HAROLD
                    Yeah.  Sure.


      Jacob walks by the river.  He picks up a rock, throws it. 
      Then hears-- what sounds like a BABY CRYING.  In the woods
      by the river.  It's disturbing.  

      He parts some bushes, sees-- a BABY CARRIAGE.  Inside, a
      baby.  Little Gail.  By herself.  He stands there a beat,
      staring at her.  Then hears-- SCREAMING.  "Help!  Help!"  He
      runs down to the river.                                                                                        45.


      Jacob gets to the riverbank, sees-- BARBARA (20's), in the
      water, holding onto a branch jutting from the bank, struggling
      to keep her head above the rushing water.  

                                      BARBARA
                    Jacob!

      Jacob scurries down the bank, carefully climbs out onto the
      branch toward her.

      She's losing her grip.  Jacob gets the farthest point of the
      branch, reaches out, Barbara's just inches too far.  He
      stretches as far as he can, building tension.

      Then-- Barbara slips, and just as she plunges into the water,
      facing certain death-- a HAND comes out and grabs her wrist. 
      The owner of the hand is: a Bald Man.  He's struggling to
      keep hold of Barbara's wrist.

                                    BALD MAN
                          (to Jacob)
                    Run!  Get help!

      Jacob, scared, full of adrenaline, scurries back over the
      log but while he does, slips.  Falls into the water.  Jacob's
      POV-- shooting down the rapids, chaos, rushing water.  Terror.


      Establishing.  Tom gets out of his car.  Heads to--


      CLOSE ON-- AN ANGEL.  A STONE ANGEL, that is.  Widen to REVEAL--

      There are actually 2 ANGELS.  And they're holding up-- A
      BOY.  It's a statue of Jacob, all part of--

      A GIANT MAUSOLEUM, maybe 12 feet high, and 12 feet by 12
      feet wide.  There's also a WOMAN statue featured at the doors
      of the mausoleum, depicting BARBARA GARLAND.  REVEAL--

      Harold, standing at the foot of the thing.  Bellamy appears
      holding a PHOTO--

                                      BELLAMY
                    We have to talk, Mr. Garland.

      Harold turns to him.  Bellamy points to a Bald Man in the
      background of the PHOTO from Act 2--

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    I had a conversation with Jacob.  He
                    told me things about the day at the
                    river.  Told me about a man.  This
                    man.
                          (shows him the photo)
                    Do you know him?

                                      HAROLD
                    Maybe.  I think he was a carpenter
                    at Garland Furniture for a time. 
                    Why?                                                                                        51.

                                      BELLAMY
                    His name is Edward Napier-- I looked
                    up the photo credit.  His current
                      whereabouts are unknown, but back
                    then he had a hunting shack near the
                    river.  Jacob said he tried to save
                    Barbara.  I don't know why he never
                    came forward, but the thing is, the
                    story Jacob told about this man being
                    there checks out.

      As Harold tries to comprehend what he's saying--

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    That's not all.  The DNA test came
                    back.
                          (then)
                    Some how, some way... biologically
                    speaking this is your son, Mr.
                    Garland.

      Harold takes that in, his eyes half closing in anguish.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    But you knew that all along, didn't
                    you?  From the moment you first saw
                    him.  You just didn't want to believe
                    it.

                                      HAROLD
                    Believe what?  The impossible?

                                      BELLAMY
                    I can only imagine how this feels--

                                      HAROLD
                    No, you can't.  How could you?  No
                    one could.

                                      BELLAMY
                    So tell me, Mr. Garland.  Help me
                      understand why you don't want your
                    son back.

      CLOSE ON-- Harold, facing the pain of that question.  SFX--
      the SOUND OF RUSHING WATER rising, building in volume and
      intensity, as if in his head, echoing Jacob in the Teaser--


      The infamous AURORA RIVER.  The rapids are fast but it doesn't
      look all that dangerous.  More peaceful.  Harold and Bellamy
      stand on a BRIDGE above the water-- the same bridge in Gail's
      flashback.  Harold's brought him here.

                                      HAROLD
                    Doesn't look all that dangerous, I
                    know.  But it's deep.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        52.

                                      HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Way deeper'n it looks.  That's why
                    the current's so strong.
                          (then)
                    It took me the better part of three
                    decades to get through Jacob's
                    passing.  To get to the point where
                    I stopped thinking of him everyday. 
                    Of his laugh.  His hair.  A joke I'd
                    like to tell him.  Three decades to
                    heal all those wounds.  And now... 
                    Every gesture, every word reminds me
                    of the life I could have had.  The
                    life I should have...
                          (getting emotional)
                    It's cruel...

      Bellamy considers that, then--

                                      BELLAMY
                    When you lose someone... it can be
                    hard to find your place in the world
                    again.  To give yourself to a world
                    that's taken so much away... it's
                    easy to retreat to a life that's
                    safe.  Easy.

      Bellamy's talking about himself, too.

                                      HAROLD
                    Guess I've lived that way for a long
                    time.
                          (then)
                    So what now?

                                      BELLAMY
                    That depends.

                                      HAROLD
                    On what?

                                      BELLAMY
                    My bosses don't know what I know. 
                    They haven't seen the way he looks
                    at you.  At Lucille.  How much he
                    needs you.

      Harold nods, knowing that's true, feeling guilty--

                                      HAROLD
                    I know.

                                      BELLAMY
                    But if I'm gonna put my ass on the
                    line for him you need to step up,
                    too.  You need to be strong.  If not
                    for your sake then for Lucille's. 
                    For Jacob's.                                                                                        53.

                                      HAROLD
                          (a man at his breaking
                            point)
                    I don't know if I can.

      Off Bellamy, considering that--


      Fred exits, walks up to his car.  Looks up-- Harold is there. 
      Leaning against the car.

                                      HAROLD
                    There's somethin' I need to tell
                    you.  Something' I shoulda told you
                    a long time ago.  It's about Barbara.

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    Okay.

                                      HAROLD
                    There was a man.  A carpenter who
                    worked at Garland Furniture.  His
                    name was Ed Napier.  Jacob says this
                    man was there at the accident.  Said
                    he tried to save her.  I believe
                    that's true.

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    Why?  If this man was there why didn't
                    he ever say something?

                                      HAROLD
                          (hesitates)
                    Because he was sleeping with her.
                          (then)
                    I'm sorry.

      Off Fred, the memory of his wife collapsing all around him--


      A beautiful old WINDMILL spins by the river, its purpose no
      longer practical; a reminder of changing times--


      Gail's car drives up to the house.  She gets out.  Walks up
      to-- Bellamy.  He gives her a slight, reassuring smile. 
      They watch as-- 

      Lucille pushes Jacob in a rope swing, hanging from a tree.
      Jacob is glad to no longer be trapped inside.  Lucille is
      elated as ever to be with him.

      Harold joins them, giving Lucille a cautious smile.  We have
      the sense it's not going to be easy, but they're gonna try
      to make this work.                                                                                        54.

      REVEAL-- Fred watches the strange reunited family from a
      distance, inside his car.  An inscrutable look on his face. 
      He drives away.  Off Gail, concerned, watching him go, a
      MUSIC CUE begins--


      Where we watch the effect of Jacob's return on our main
      players...

      TOM, at home, stares at-- his Bible.  He's glad to have won
      the battle in church, but wonders how he'll get through this
      crisis of faith.  Janine watches him from the b.g., concerned
      about him and their future...

      GAIL knocks on a door of a HOUSE, a worried look on her face. 
      Receiving no answer, she walks away.  

      We move INSIDE THE HOUSE Gail just walked away from, where--
        a half-empty bottle of whiskey sits on a table.  REVEAL -
      FRED, sitting behind it.  Despondent.  He's looking at--
      PHOTOS of him and his young wife.  Along with newspaper
      clippings.  A headline reads: "Sheriff's Wife Dies Trying to
      Save Garland Child."  There's a terrible sadness in him. 
      But also a rage beneath that sadness.  It's clear he's still
      angry.  At God?  At Jacob for bringing all of this up again,
      besmirching the memory of his beloved wife?

      He suddenly stands, grabbing the bottle, and throws it--
      smashing it against the wall.  Is this man dangerous?

      LUCILLE shows Jacob to his "room."  She hands him a new toy -
      an updated version of his old G.I. Joe (perhaps Buzz
      Lightyear).  He loves it.  Harold watches from the door, a
      slight smile.

      END MONTAGE.  The sound of LAUGHTER takes us into--


      Bellamy stands outside the bar, on the phone with Dr. Willis--

                                      BELLAMY (INTO PHONE)
                      ...Everything's under control,
                      Catherine...
                          (lying)
                    He's still at the clinic.  I'm gonna
                    check into a B&B, hang around a few
                    days to monitor the situation... No. 
                    No test results, yet.  I'll keep you
                    updated.

      He hangs up as-- Gail, Connor and Elaine pour out of the bar--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                          (urgent)
                    My car's there--

                                      BELLAMY
                    Dr. Garland--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    It's her brother.  He's off his meds. 
                    He's got a gun.


      Gail, Connor, Elaine and Bellamy run up to-- Ray Dawson,
      eyes WILD, standing outside a tool shed, holding a SHOTGUN--

                                    RAY DAWSON
                          (to shed)
                    Don't you do anything stupid now, ya
                    hear?                                                                                        56.

                                      ELAINE
                    Ray!  What are you doing?  Who's in
                    there?

                                    RAY DAWSON
                          (excited)
                    The demon!  Got him trapped!  Right
                    inside the shed!

                                      ELAINE
                    Calm down, Ray--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    It's gonna be alright.  Just put
                    down the gun down.

                                    RAY DAWSON
                          (realizing)
                    You don't believe me.  None a you.

      He opens the door, bangs the shed with the butt of his gun--

                                    RAY DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Show y'self, Demon!  Come on out,
                    now!

      After a beat, a man steps out.  It's the Disheveled Man.  He
      slowly lifts his head, takes off his hat-- he's NOT BALD.

                                      DISHEVELED MAN
                    Hi, Elaine.

      Elaine looks at him, gasps, scared, backing away.

                                      DISHEVELED MAN (CONT'D)
                    It's okay.

                                      ELAINE
                    No.

                                      DISHEVELED MAN
                    Elaine.  It's okay.  It's me.

                                      ELAINE
                          (softening; emotional)
                    Dad?

      This isn't the Bald Man Jacob saw.  Her father.  Who died 13
      years ago.  This thing hasn't ended.  It's only just begun. 
      Off everyone's reactions--

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

      After a beat, A WHITE TITLE CARD appears, with a bass-heavy
      THUMP:  "The Returned".  Another beat and-- the card
      disappears, plunging us back into darkness.  Some might wonder
      if it ever appeared at all or if they just imagined it.

                                      END PILOT
