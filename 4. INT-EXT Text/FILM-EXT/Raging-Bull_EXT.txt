It's a rough neighborhood, inhabited primarily by welfare
cases and street kids.
In the street, two young PUNKS, 13 or 14 years old, exchange
words and start to fight. Their FRIENDS cheer them on. SALVY
and JOEY turn the corner.
JOEY
Salvy, would I steer you wrong?
Let's say that's the truck; it's
full of cigarettes, right? Now, two
o'clock this morning we move the
truck from here to there,
(he points; the CAMERA
PANS)
take the cigarettes out, sell 'em,
make some cash.
SALVY
Hey but Joey, you're thinking
nickels and dimes. The money's with
your brother.
JOEY
What do you want from my life,
Salvy? He's my brother.
SALVY
He ain't doin' the right thing.
He's makin' beans compared to what
he should be makin'. Can't you make
him understand that?
A COP goes over and starts to break up the fight.
JOEY
(to cop)
Hey, leave the kids alone.
SALVY
Get lost.
(joking, he knows the Cop)
Hey kids, "A cop is a rat."
Remember that, "A rat."
The KIDS yell.
JOEY
(to Cop)
Hey Jimmy, here's a dollar for your
trouble. There's some bums around
the corner -- they need your help.
COP
Keep the dollar, Joey. Get yourself
a new suit.
JOEY
(laughs)
Here's my new suit.
(grabs his crotch)
Right here.
COP
Hey, don't get wise!
JOEY
Just kidding, take it easy.
(to himself)
No fuckin' sense of humor.
SALVY and JOEY continue to walk a little faster, giggling.
SALVY and JOEY approach the building.
JOEY
I can't convince him. He's got such
a thick head, I'd like to crack it
open myself. Believe me, my own
brother. It's very hard. You don't
have to convince me -- I know we
should be with Tommy. You talk to
him. He don't listen to nobody.
SALVY
Look, I'm just tellin' you how
Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard
on himself. Tommy wants him with
us. It's as simple as that.
They stop at the doorway.
SALVY (CONT'D)
Talk some sense into him, will ya?
You're still his brother.
If he ain't gonna listen to you, he
ain't gonna listen to nobody!
JOEY
All right, I'll try. See you later.
SALVY
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
JOEY
Right, the gym.
SALVY leaves. JOEY goes into the building.
Gleason's, a small gym and fight club, stands on 149th Street
and 3rd Avenue above a small sandwich shop.
Each day BOBBY GLEASON posts a small sign alongside the door
listing the fighters who will be working out. JAKE's name is
posted at the top; the other names are unmemorable.
The Shorehaven Pool, spic-and-span in the summer sun is the
closest thing to a country club in the Bronx. An eight foot
fence stands between the pool and the street.
JAKE, wearing slacks and a sportshirt, hangs out with the
"BOYS" near the bar area. Older, "MADE" MEN play cards. A
young FAN walks by and says:
FAN
Hey, Jake.
At the opposite end of the pool where the GIRLS gossip, and
sunbathe, JOEY swaps small talk with VICKIE, a school girl,
about 15. VICKIE is a knockout.
SALVY, FRANKIE and JUNIOR are with VICKIE and her FRIENDS.
They joke with JOEY.
JAKE watches SALVY and VICKIE.
JAKE'S P.O.V.: JOEY is talking (PAN) to VICKIE. VICKIE
giggles. JOEY stands and walks over to JAKE.
JAKE
(referring to Vickie)
Who's that?
JOEY
Whadda you care?
JAKE
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who
is she? What's a matter? You afraid
I'm gonna take her on you?
JOEY
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna
meet her?
JAKE
Yeah --
JOEY
Cause I'll go right over there and
bring her here.
JAKE
Go 'head.
JOEY
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't
make me go over there, you change
your mind and you make me look bad,
cause she's really a knockout.
She's 15, this kid -- a great piece
of ass.
JAKE
How do you know? You know her that
good?
JOEY
No, I see her around the pool. I
know her. I know her like that --
not like that.
JAKE
(gesturing to his bandage)
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I
don't feel right...
JAKE watches VICKIE.
JOEY and JAKE come out of the building and start walking down
the street.
IRMA opens the window on the second floor right above them,
and shouts out to them:
IRMA
Go ahead -- that's all you're good
for -- to go out and leave me here
like a dog. You and your brother!
You don't even look like brothers.
You look like faggots! That's what
you look like -- faggots!
JAKE and JOEY walk faster down the block, pretending that
IRMA must be shouting at someone else.
She throws a bottle at them. It smashes in the street.
ESTABLISHING SHOT.
JAKE watches as SALVY ushers everyone into his Cadillac, and
then drives off.
JAKE stares after the car for a moment, then goes back
inside.
JAKE and JOEY get out of their Packard convertible and walk
over to the fence surrounding the pool. VICKIE is by the
pool.
JOEY
(calling out to Vickie)
Hey, Vickie, c'mere. Don't be
afraid. C'mere. Just say hello.
This is my brother.
VICKIE comes over to the fence.
JOEY (CONT'D)
Vickie, I want you to meet my
brother, Jake. He's gonna be the
next champ.
JAKE puts his fingers through the fence.
JAKE
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is
that right? You wanted to meet me?
VICKIE
(to Joey)
I just wanted to say hello.
JAKE
You wanted to say hello, eh? I
can't believe it. When did you fall
outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you
you're the most beautiful one here,
princess of the pool. You got a
baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha
wanna meet me for?
VICKIE
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
JAKE
(to Joey)
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face
is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now?
You wanna go for a ride?
PAN to car.
VICKIE
Sure. Gimme a few minutes.
She starts to go.
JAKE
Hey...
She turns. JAKE kisses his hand and holds it up to the fence
by her lips.
JAKE drives his Packard convertible down Shore Road. VICKIE
sits in the passenger seat, her blonde hair blowing in the
wind. VICKIE feels JAKE's eyes all over her, and loves it.
On the radio, Bing Crosby sings "Just One More Charce."
JAKE parks across the street from the new miniature golf
course on Shore Road. The Shore Road course is one of the
best. The first green features a pink windmill.
JAKE and VICKIE get out to cross the street.
VICKIE
You don't talk very much.
JAKE
I ain't ever talked to a movie star
before.
VICKIE
(giggles)
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in
high school.
JAKE
Oh no? I thought you was a movie
star.
A bus heads toward them.
VICKIE
Jake! The bus!
JAKE holds up his hand.
JAKE
Any bus gives you trouble, I knock
it out for ya.
The bus stops for them as they cross the street.
JAKE sets VICKIE's ball on the tee facing the windmill.
VICKIE
You go first. Let me watch how to
do this.
JAKE
You don't get nothin' done by
watchin'. You just gotta do it.
Here, I'll help you.
JAKE hands VICKIE the putter, then moves behind her and puts
her hand on the club.
JAKE (CONT'D)
That's it. Just grip up a little
tighter. That's it. You're gonna be
real good at this. How does that
feel?
VICKIE
It feels real good.
JAKE
Just keep your eye on the ball.
VICKIE
Should I hit it?
JAKE
Just give it a nice little tap.
VICKIE swings and the ball rolls into the center of the
windmill. VICKIE breaks free and follows her ball. JAKE
follows.
VICKIE
I can't find my ball.
JAKE
Can you see it?
VICKIE bends and looks under the windmill.
VICKIE
No.
JAKE bends and looks.
VICKIE (CONT'D)
Can you see it?
JAKE
No.
VICKIE
What does that mean?
JAKE takes VICKIE by the arm.
JAKE
It means the game is over.
JAKE throws his putter on the next green.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Let's get outa here.
JAKE and VICKIE pull up to a tenement.
JAKE dashes around the car to open the door for VICKIE.
They enter the building.
JOEY looks up the street for VICKIE. She is gone.
SALVY and PATSY come out of the entrance.
SALVY
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die
young?
JOEY
(as he turns and lashes
into Salvy and Patsy)
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll
fuckin' take the two of you.
After a few moments, PAUL and the BOUNCERS from the Copa come
out. The BOUNCERS pull PATSY away. They try to separate SALVY
and JOEY, but can't.
JOEY savagely beats SALVY on the Copa steps and in the street
against the parked cars.
JOEY (CONT'D)
Fuckin' low-life, cocksucker, etc.
...
SALVY tries to fight back, but JOEY is too tough for him.
SALVY hits the pavement. JOEY kicks him.
PAUL, PATSY, and the BOUNCERS finally pull JOEY away. PATSY
tries to go after JOEY again, but PAUL stops him.
PATSY
(to Paul)
Don't fuckin' put your hands on me!
You're gonna near about this, Paul.
PAUL
(to Patsy)
Get the fuck outa here. Don't come
in my place and start fuckin'
trouble -- I don't care who you
are!
(to Joey)
Get outa here. Go on.
JOEY looks back at him, and then walks away.
Another day. JOEY, fully clothed, opens the gate and looks
around.
JAKE is sitting alone near the deep end. JOEY walks over to
him.
JOEY
Whatcha doin'?
JAKE
I remember the first time I met
Vickie... I know there's somethin'
up. I know she's doin' somethin',
but I can't catch her...
JOEY
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit
her so she can't talk to you the
way she wants to.
JAKE
What do you mean?
JOEY
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife
-- ask her what's the matter.
JAKE
When I'm away, did you ever notice
anythin' funny with her? Tell me
the truth.
JOEY
Jack, if there was anything funny,
I would tell you.
JAKE
I want you to keep an eye on her
when I'm not here. Understand?
JOEY
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
JAKE
What did Tommy say?
JOEY
I got good news, and I got bad
news. The good news is you got your
shot at the title. The bad news
is...
JAKE
(interrupting, resigned)
Yeah, I know.
It's raining outside the stately Book-Cadillac.
A banner above the door proclaims.
The Book-Cadillac Welcomes
Marcel Cerdan
Middleweight Champion of the World
and the Challenger
Jake LaMotta
Bright floodlights illuminate the arena. The weather's clear
and the stadium is filled with cheering fight FANS.
An ANNOUNCER steps into the center of the ring and begins ti
introduce the many CELEBRITIES that have gathered for the
fight.
ANNOUNCER
And here is the young man who has
inherited Marcel Cerdan's European
championship - Laurent Dauthuille.
DAUTHUILLE jumps into the ring.
While WE HEAR him introduce the boxers and celebrities, WE
SEE a rapid MONTAGE: JAKE preparing for the title bout:
PRE-FIGHT MONTAGE
A) JAKE and GROUP arrive in the dressing room.
B) In his bathrobe, JAKE puts on his boxing shoes.
C) We see a pan with raw steak in it. JOEY drains the blood
(juice) into a glass and JAKE takes a long, slow swallow.
D) REPRISE of IMAGES from PREVIOUS SCENE (SLOW MOTION) - NEW
ANGLE.
TOMMY COMO shakes JAKE's hand in the bathroom doorway. VICKIE
kisses COMO. Jake watches.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
And our very special guest tonight
needs no introduction. The only man
to defend the heavyweight crown a
remarkable twenty-five times, the
king of all heavyweights, the Brown
Bomber, Joe Louis. Come into the
ring, Joe.
JOE LOUIS (V.O.)
Thank you, Johnny. Let's bring the
middleweight crown back to the old
U.S.A. where it belongs.
Many cheers.
E) DR. PINTO injects a hypodermic needle filled with
novocaine into each of JAKE's fists.
F) JOEY massages JAKE's neck.
G) JAKE's hands are bandaged
H) REPRISE of IMAGES from PREVIOUS SCENE (SLOW MOTION - NEW
ANGLE)
JAKE strangles VICKIE in the bedroom, then releases her.
JOEY looks after her, but the IMAGE makes them look as if
they're making love. Jake watches.
ANNOUNCER
And in this corner, the
middleweight champion of the world,
from Casablanca, Morocco, the
Casablanca Clouter, Marcel Cerdan!
I) JAKE puts on his cup and trunks.
J) MARIO laces up JAKE's gloves.
K) JAKE, ready to fight, a towel draped around his head,
bounces on the balls of his feet. He starts walking down the
corridor from his dressing room, surrounded by MARIO, JOEY,
DR. PINTO and his HANDLERS. He enters the stadium.
The name "Jake LaMotta's Lounge" is emblazoned in neon across
a lounge/liquor store on Collins Avenue, Miami's main drag.
JAKE's bar is across from The Rooney Plaza, one of Miami's
more prestigious hotels.
Fifties cars are parked outside the club.
VICKIE gives JAKE a final push out the door and then slams it
in his face.
JAKE is left alone on the front steps.
DISSOLVE TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT. The house is quite large, and has
beautiful landscaping and a swimming pool.
JAKE, hungover, his tux wrinkled, walks out of the club to
the adjacent parking lot.
VICKIE is sitting in her yellow Cadillac outside the Club.
The curbside window is halfway up. She calls to him:
VICKIE
Jake.
JAKE, chagrined, steps over to the car.
JAKE
I'm sorry. I had to work late last
night. Slept at the club.
VICKIE
I'm leaving your Jake.
JAKE
Sure, what else is new?
VICKIE
No. This time it's true. I didn't
bother to tell you until I had
everything worked out.
JAKE tries to open the door. It's locked.
JAKE
Open the door, Vickie.
VICKIE
No. I won't talk to you where you
can use your hands on me.
JAKE
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
VICKIE
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting
a divorce. I'm getting custody of
the kids.
JAKE
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
VICKIE
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you
this way. You're too drunk all the
time. There's too many girls. I
can't... I don't wanna talk about
it. I made up my mind.
JAKE tries to reach in the window, but VICKIE hits the power
switch, closing it and catching his hand. She now has to yell
to him:
VICKIE (CONT'D)
You got three days to get your
stuff out of the house. After that,
the cops will be there. I have the
kids with me. I never want to see
you again.
VICKIE turns her face and drives away.
JAKE grabs at the Cadillac, but it is bigger and stronger
than him.
JAKE is left alone in the parking lot. The car is gone.
JAKE, wearing a suit, walks up to the door and pushes the
bell.
VICKIE opens the door and looks at him over the chain.
JAKE
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
VICKIE
Are you drunk?
JAKE
No. Open the door.
JAKE tries to touch her face through the doorway crack, but
she steps back.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Please, Vick. I won't bother you.
I'm out on bail. You can send the
kids next door. I just gotta pick
one thing up, then I'll get outa
here.
VICKIE thinks a moment, then opens the door and lets JAKE in.
VICKIE
The kids are sleeping.
JAKE
I promise I just gotta pick up one
thing.
VICKIE
All right, just don't make any
noise.
JAKE places a call from a booth outside the jewelry store.
JAKE
(on phone)
I can't raise the ten thousand.
Fuck 'em. Let 'em put me on trial.
The Club is closing. JAKE and EMMA, the stripper, come out
and walk by a delicatessen on their way to a parking lot.
JAKE sees his brother JOEY enter the delicatessen.
JAKE
Look, sweetie, be a good girl.
Here's some money. Take a cab. Go
home by yourself. Just wanna walk
around a little, sort of unwind.
OK?
EMMA
Will I see you later?
JAKE
Yeah. I dunno... I'll call you.
JAKE goes to the parking lot entrance as EMMA gets into a
cab.
DISSOLVE TO:
It's about twenty minutes later.
DOLLY INTO A MEDIUM SHOT of JAKE waiting by the parking lot.
He looks at the delicatessen.
JOEY finally comes out carrying a paper bag. Not noticing
JAKE, he walks right past him to his car which is parked near
the rear of the outdoor lot.
JAKE
Hey, Joey --
JAKE walks towards JOEY with his hand outstretched.
JOEY looks at JAKE. Silence. JOEY turns his back and starts
to get into his car.
JAKE runs over to JOEY and grabs his shoulder.
JAKE (CONT'D)
No, Joey, no. Look, wait a minute,
please --
JOEY looks at JAKE like he's shit, throws JAKE's hand off his
shoulder, and starts to get into his car again.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Aw, Joey --
JAKE stops JOEY from getting into his car. He puts his hand
on JOEY's shoulder again.
JAKE (CONT'D)
You're right. You're perfectly
right. You got every right in the
world to hate my guts.
JOEY pulls away from JAKE's hand, and tries to put the paper
bag into the front seat of the car.
JAKE (CONT'D)
No, please. I know I was a
cocksucker. You're right. I shoulda
never raised my hands to you.
JOEY half pushes JAKE away, and begins to get into his car
again.
JAKE pulls JOEY by the arm.
JAKE (CONT'D)
No, Joey, listen to me --
JAKE pulls too hard, causing JOEY to drop the paper bag to
his feet. The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break
open and splatter JOEY's pants legs.
JOEY stares down at his pants, then up at JAKE. Suddenly, he
belts JAKE with a left and a right to the jaw. JAKE is taken
by surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up.
JOEY keeps pouring it on. JAKE drops his hands and takes it.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Go ahead.
(gets punched)
Hit me again.
(gets punched)
I deserve it...
(gets punched)
Pay me back...
(gets punched)
More...
(gets punched)
JOEY stops in mid-punch and stares at JAKE. He can't figure
it out.
JAKE nods and tries to smile, but starts to cry instead.
JAKE (CONT'D)
More. Go ahead, Joey. I deserve it.
JOEY pauses, then finally throws a very weak punch to JAKE's
shoulder.
He leaves his hand there -- then, uncurls his fist -- and
finally puts his hand around JAKE's neck as tears start to
fill his eyes.
JOEY hugs JAKE close to him, crying.
They hug each other, both crying. They don't say anything.
The theater lights are flashing.
This may not be Broadway, but it's a long way from the
Metropole. The entrance to the Barbizon looks out on the
corner of 6th Avenue and Central Park South.
A stand-up billboard in front of the theater advertises "An
Evening with Jake LaMotta." The billboard also lists the
authors whose works will be performed: Paddy Chayevsky, Rod
Serling, Shakespeare, Bud Schulberg, Tennessee Williams.
