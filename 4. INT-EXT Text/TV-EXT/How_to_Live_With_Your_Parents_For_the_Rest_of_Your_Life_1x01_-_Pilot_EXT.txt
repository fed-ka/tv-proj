      CHYRON: 1 YEAR AGO TODAY. POLLY, wearing a m lange of 
      mismatched clothing, and a 4-YEAR-OLD NATALIE, similarly 
      dressed, DRIVE UP to Elaine and Max s idyllic suburban home.

                                  POLLY (V.O.)
                    Exactly one year ago today, my 
                    daughter, Natalie, and I showed up 
                    at my parents  house...



      Polly and Natalie outside Max and Elaine s house.   Polly 
      rings the doorbell.  The door swings open, revealing ELAINE 
      and MAX, both in towels; Elaine's hair all messed up.  

                                  POLLY
                    Mommy, Max, I hope this isn't a bad 
                    time for you, 'cause it is for me.  

      Polly looks down at Max s crotch. Max grabs  The Corrections  
      from the armoire and holds it in front of himself.  Polly 
      rolls her eyes...  really?  



      Polly, Max and Natalie CARRY BOXES into the house.  

                                  POLLY (V.O.)
                    Oh, look, there we are carrying 
                    boxes,  cause we re moving in with 
                    my parents.  Yay!  

      Elaine mimes helping Max, but lets go when her CELL RINGS.



      CHYRON: PRESENT DAY.  Polly and Natalie drive up to the 
      house, looking much more together.  They get out of the car, 
      cross to the front door, which Polly opens with her own key.

                                  POLLY (V.O.)
                    The school district s great. And I 
                    want to be the mother I never had, 
                    and because of the mother I did 
                    have, I don't know how, so I need 
                    her support. Does that makes sense?  
                    (THEN) I should maybe-probably go 
                    back to therapy...



      As Polly pulls out of the driveway, Julian pulls in.  

                                  POLLY (V.O.)
                    My relationship with my ex is... 
                    what s that word that sounds like a 
                    good thing but when people say it 
                    they make a judge-y face?  Oh, 
                    right, codependent.  

                                  JULIAN
                    Guess what I got.

                                  POLLY
                      A checking account?  

                                  JULIAN
                    A life hammer!

      As Julian shows Polly a SURVIVAL TOOL from his bag:

                                  JULIAN (CONT D)
                    It breaks your car window in case 
                    you get trapped in your car 
                      underwater.  I wanna do a test run.  
                    Will you time me? It takes ninety 
                    seconds for a car to fill up with 
                    water...    How To Live                                              7.


                                  POLLY (V.O.)
                    In my defense, when I met Julian he 
                    looked exactly like a young Jeff 
                    Daniels, and I m attracted to 
                    people who look like younger 
                    versions of famous people.



      Polly SEES Max running in his jeans, trailed by a POLICE CAR. 



      Polly runs down the street where she s meeting Luke.  Her 
      CELL RINGS.  It s JULIAN -- wanting to FaceTime with her!  
      She answers, trying to be discreet in case Luke is watching.

                                  POLLY
                    Julian?  Oh my God, I can see you!  

                                  JULIAN
                    (VIA FACETIME) Pretty great, huh?  
                    And did you check out all the cool 
                    apps?  GPS, voice recognition... 
                    and you SEE whatever I'm talking 
                    about. So listen, I just found 
                    this...

      He reveals a SERIOUS LOOKING LETTER WITH BOLD RED WRITING.

                                  JULIAN (CONT D)
                    Is a 'summons' the same thing as a 
                    'bench warrant?' 

      She comes up to Luke s car.  He gets out to greet her.

                                  POLLY
                    (HANGING UP) Okay, bye!

      ANGLE ON - ELAINE AND MAX

      Watching Polly and Luke shake hands, laugh.

                                  ELAINE
                    That guy s cute.  Oh, look, he s 
                    got flowers...

      ANGLE ON - POLLY AND LUKE

      Through the window, Luke hands Polly the flowers.

      BACK TO - ELAINE AND MAX

      Max and Elaine look at each other.

                          MAX*ELAINE*
      She s on a date!*Cha cha cha!*

      They jump up and down, excited.  How To Live                                              19.



      Polly drags a now totally wasted Luke out of the club.  

                                  LUKE
                    Ooo, are we gonna have sex?

                                  POLLY
                    Yeah, like any part of you could 
                    have sex now.

                                  LUKE
                    Boo.  (THEN) There s my car!  

      Luke tries to unlock his car with the remote, sets off the 
      alarm instead.

                                  LUKE (CONT D)
                    Whoops.

                                  POLLY
                    Wow, ativan-tinis: one. Luke: zero. 



      Polly's lost in a sketchy neighborhood.  Luke plays with the 
      MUSIC, fast forwarding through each song.  

                                  POLLY
                    I thought this neighborhood was 
                      artsy-fartsy, but it s more gunsy-
                    knivesy.    

      Polly sees TWO MALE CLUB-GOERS, rolls down her window.

                                  POLLY (CONT D)
                    (BIG SMILE) Hi, hey, we re lost.  
                    How do I get... out of here?

                                  LUKE
                    (CALLING OUT WINDOW) Yo, homes, 
                    where da party at?

                                  CLUB-GOER #1
                    You got a problem?

                                  POLLY
                    (OUT WINDOW) Yes, homes, he has 
                    many problems.    How To Live                                              24.


      Polly peels away, turns to Luke.

                                  POLLY (CONT D)
                    This is no way for a fragile person 
                    to behave!  (THEN) I m totally 
                    lost. (GETTING AN IDEA) Wait a 
                    minute.  

      She pulls out her cell phone, pushes a button.

                                  POLLY (CONT D)
                    (TO PHONE) Please work, please 
                    work, please--

                                  CELL PHONE (V.O.)
                    Hello Polly, how can I help?

                                  POLLY
                    It knows my name!



      Polly pulls into her driveway, SEES Julian's car drive up.

                                  POLLY
                    (TO HERSELF) Oh, crap.

      Julian sees Polly, starts HONKING.  Polly waves, weakly.

                                  LUKE
                    Who s that?

                                  POLLY
                    My ex-husband, so maintain.

      Julian gets out of his car, as does Polly, trying to cover.

                                  POLLY (CONT D)
                    Hey, hi! That GPS thingy on the 
                    phone? Genius. You did good, you.

                                  JULIAN
                    You look hot.  

                                  POLLY
                    Not really, this is fake leather 
                    that just looks expensive. I was at 
                    a boring work party.

      As Luke opens the car door and spills out on the ground:

                                  LUKE

                                  POLLY
                      (MAINTAINING HER DIGNITY, TO 
                    JULIAN) So why are you here?

      Julian knows what s going on but chooses to ignore it.

                                  JULIAN
                    Natalie called me... something 
                    about a dog?

                                  POLLY
                    Max s damn dog sculpture!  That s 
                    it!  I m taking the other ball!

      Polly, pissed, crosses to the front door, followed by Julian 
      and a staggering Luke.



      Polly, Natalie, Elaine, Max, Julian, Luke, and the puppy, 
      look at Julian s car, CRASHED against the curb. 

                                  JULIAN
                    My car has air bags?  Cool.  

      Luke laughs hysterically for an inordinately long time before 
      abruptly hurling.  More BARKING.



      Polly and Julian walk Luke inside -- he has an arm over each 
      of them.  Elaine, Max and Natalie play with the puppy.  How To Live                                              31.


                                  POLLY
                    I m sorry I didn t tell you.  I was 
                    worried it would make things 
                      uncomfortable between us.

      Luke lets loose a massive drunken belch in Julian s face.

                                  JULIAN
                    No, come on, this is great...

                                  POLLY
                    I can t believe my parents got a 
                    dog.  Again.

                                  JULIAN
                    You should give them a break. They re 
                    just trying to take care of you.

      They get to the door, which has a key code.  He turns to Luke

                                  JULIAN (CONT D)
                    Rock Star, what s your code?

                                  LUKE

      Luke passes out on his shoulder.

                                  JULIAN
                    Where d you meet this loser?

                                  POLLY
                    He s Jenn s brother.  He was the 
                    only loser I could get.

                                  JULIAN
                    You?  (RAKISH SMILE) You re catnip 
                    to losers.

      Julian dumps Luke on Polly, grabs his LIFE HAMMER from his 
      pocket and breaks a window.  Just then, Jenn opens the door.

                                  JENN
                    What the hell...?

                                  POLLY
                    Hey, Jenn!  Super date.

      As they all help Luke inside:

                                  POLLY (V.O.)
                    Okay, so I probably won't end up 
                    being the best single working mom 
                    in the Universe.  But that s fine, 
                    because I looked on the internet

                    Even so, I did write a little 
                      acceptance speech.



      Julian leaves a six-pack of Max's cream soda at the doorstep 

                                  POLLY (V.O.)
                    I d like to thank my ex-husband.  
                    I d call him and tell him but the 
                    phone stopped working.

      Julian drives off in his car - THE FRONT BUMPER NOW TIED ON.
