      The car passes through a quiet village.

                                  MALE VOICE #1 (O.C.)
                    You re verified.  Are you calling 
                    from an open line?

                                  MALE VOICE #2 (O.C.)
                    Yes.

                                  MALE VOICE #1 (O.C.)
                    One moment while I secure.

      Ahead we see the lights of a large, isolated house on the 
      edge of the village.  The house belongs to a man named 
      Braddick.

      The car pulls to a stop.  The lights remain on, the engine 
      turns over.



      Two men get out. The driver remains behind the wheel.  The 
      men are late 20s, early 30s.  They re tense.

      The man who got out of the passenger seat is handsome, with 
      a ruthless smile.  His name is MARK VENN.

      The other man is PAUL HILLMAN.                                                                                  2.


      Mark talks through the open window to the driver, Hillman 
      lurking just behind them.

                                  MARK
                    You re gonna be okay, no problem.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      Marks grins. 

                                  MARK
                    It s not complicated.  Me and 
                    Hillman go in, you wait, we come 
                    out, we drive away.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      She walks down the street, tears off the tip of the bread and 
      munches it as she walks.

      An Algerian man, MEZWAR TANZIR, steps out of a doorway and 
      follows her.



      Jennifer turns to see Tanzir behind her.  Tanzir pulls out 
      a KNIFE.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      CLOSE ON - FRANCES

      a woman in her early to mid thirties, dark, beautiful, 
      desperate and trouble.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL:



      Hustle and bustle on the street.  



      Harry walks to his car.

                                  HARRY
                    Clear the rest of the day.  I m not 
                    coming back.  Did you get anything 
                    on Hodgkins Truss Wilson?

                                  MATT 
                    All I could find is their 
                      registered ID, 309098, but 
                    there s no other details, not 
                    even a DX address.

                                  HARRY
                    Nothing?  How do they do 
                    business?

                                  MATT
                    Just the number you gave me.

                                  HARRY
                    Did you try it?

                                  MATT
                    It goes straight to robot.  

                                  HARRY
                    What about Gina Hawkes?

                                  MATT
                    I ve tried Google, Yahoo, 
                    Facebook - nothing.  Which is 
                    only a little weird, because my 
                    mum, she shows up on Google and 
                    the only thing she s famous for 
                    are school dinners.

                                  HARRY
                    We represented a client called 
                    Joe Collins, Joseph Francis 
                    Collins, about five years ago--                                                                                21.

                    the only defendant and he was 
                      acquitted.  Thanks to you.

                                  HARRY
                    Dig out the file.

                                  MATT
                    Harry, I ve got like a million 
                    things to do.

                                  HARRY
                    Call me when you ve got it.  

                                  MATT
                          (resigned)
                    Anything else?

                                  HARRY
                    Don t expect overtime.

      Matt laughs: As if.

                                  MATT
                    Don t forget Frank Hanna.

                          (looking through the 
                            diary)
                    Let s see.  How is next Tuesday?

      Harry ends the call.  He takes out Gina Hawkes s card and 
      hits the numbers.

                                  AUTOMATED VOICE
                    Thank you for calling Hodgkins 
                    Truss Wilson.  Please state your 
                    name clearly and the reason for

                                  HARRY
                    It s Harry Venn calling for Gina 
                    Hawkes.  My number is 07779 
                    271299.

      Harry ends the call.  He s about to get into his car when 
      he sees--


      FENTON RUSSELL

      silky and dangerous.  Now an Inspector.  Russell walks from 
      his car with a COLLEAGUE.                                                                                  22.


      Russell looks directly over at Harry - neutral and menacing 
      at the same time.  

      Harry gets a jolt.  He watches Russell proceed to the gate.  



      LAUREN, attractive, late 30s, is watering plants in her 
      garden.                                                                                23.


      CROSSCUT:

                                  HARRY
                    I ve just seen Fenton Russell.

      Lauren stops what she is doing.

                                  LAUREN
                    Where?

                                  HARRY
                    I need to see you, Lauren.



      Jennifer Moscati walks down the street.  She tears off the 
      tip of the bread and munches it as she walks.

                                                                        BACK TO:



      Jennifer continues down the quiet street.  She becomes 
      aware of someone following her. 

      She turns to see--


      MEZWAR TANZIR

                                                                        BACK TO:



      Coming up behind Jennifer.  She turns.  He pulls out a knife.  
      He indicates her purse.

                                  JENNIFER MOSCATI
                          (in French)
                    Take it.  Take it, don t hurt me.

      Tanzir takes the purse.  A motorbike approaches.  Tanzir 
      turns to go to the bike.

      Inwardly, Jennifer heaves a sigh of relief.  Then Tanzir 
      turns back to Jennifer...

      Tanzir knifes Jennifer.  He grabs the baguette, jumps on the 
      bike and they take off. He tears off a piece of the baguette 
      and starts eating.

                                                                        BACK TO:



      Harry pushes at the door to the building.  To his surprise 
      it doesn t open.

      He checks the time.  It s almost 11.  He gets out his keys 
      and enters, turning off the alarm before climbing the 
      stairs to the first floor suite.



      Watched by the driver in the waiting car, a PASSING POLICE 
      PATROL CAR pulls up.


      HARRY S POV:

      TWO COPS get out...  

      They look around, taking things in, just checking...

      One cop goes to the front door...  

      The other appears at the car window and taps for the driver 
      to lower it...

      Mark hesitates...

      The cop taps impatiently and starts to speak into his 
      radio...

      Mark is about to comply when...

      BANG!  BANG!  BANG!

      The cop at the house is thrown backwards by the force of 
      the blast...

      MARK AND HILLMAN run from the house towards the car...

      The cop at the car blanches.  He turns and puts his hands 
      up...

      Hillman walks up to him, takes aim and shoots him in the 
      head...

      Mark jumps in the car.  Hillman jumps in the back.

                                    HILLMAN
                    What are you waiting for!  Go!

      Harry throws the car in gear and screeches away.

                                                                        BACK TO:



      Gina is heading for the Eurostar check-in.

                                  GINA
                          (into the mobile)
                    This is Gina Hawkes.

                                  HARRY
                    Where are you?  I ll be there in 
                    twenty minutes.  Okay, half an 
                    hour.  We ll have lunch.

                                  GINA
                    I m on my way to Paris.

                                  HARRY
                    I ll take the next train.  We ll 
                    have dinner.  

                                  GINA
                    Have you thought about what we 
                      discussed?

                                  HARRY
                    I ve thought about you, Gina.  
                      Constantly.  Day and night, you 
                    really want to know.                                                                                56.


                                  GINA
                    Will you take the job?

                                  HARRY 
                    If I can have a down payment of 
                    ten thousand pounds.

                                  GINA
                    Call the Hodgkins Truss Willson 
                    number and leave your bank 
                    details.  The money will be in 
                    your account by the end of the 
                    day.  

                                  HARRY
                    You work fast, Gina.  I like 
                    that.  Where should we have 
                    dinner?  I know a place on the 
                    Rue du Bac--

                                  GINA
                    I expect two updates a day, at 
                    midnight and 7am.  If at any time 
                    you find anything significant you 
                    are to call me at once.

                                  HARRY
                    Do you want to define 
                      significant?  For instance, 
                    you ve become a significant part 
                    of my life and--

                              GINA
                    You will receive the balance of 
                    your fee when you locate Collins.  
                    Once you find him you are not to 
                    let him out of your sight until I 
                    get there.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    You know, if I ever get in 
                    trouble I want you to be my 
                    lawyer.  In fact, I would get in 
                    trouble just to have you as my 
                    lawyer.

                              GINA
                    Call me if there s anything else 
                    you need.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, I m sure there will be.

                                  GINA HAWKES
                    Goodbye.

                                  HARRY 
                    Wait.  Hold up.  One more thing.                                                                                57.


      He takes out the PHOTOGRAPH OF STYLES that he took from 
      Gina s room.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Have you ever heard of a man 
                    named Jason Styles?

                                  GINA
                    No.  Why?

                                  HARRY
                    Oh, Gina, lovely Gina.  You d be 
                    smashing in the box, you know 
                    that?  If I didn t know better 
                    I d believe you were telling the 
                    truth, and I never believe 
                    anyone.    

                                  GINA

                                  HARRY
                    Harry.

      She hangs up.  Harry stands holding the phone, smiling.  
      The phone rings and without thinking...

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Gina?

                    Who is this?

      The line goes dead.  Harry gets up.  He motions to Matt.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Come on!

                                  MATT
                    Where are we going?

                                  HARRY
                    Just come!

      He hurries out.  Matt follows curiously.

                                  MATT
                    What s going on?                                                                                58.



      Harry and Matt stare at the building.

                                  HARRY
                    Somebody called and warned me to 
                    get out of the office.

                                  MATT
                    Frances coming with a gun?

      Harry doesn t answer.  They are both quiet.  Nothing 
      happens.

                                  MATT (CONT'D)
                    Some people have a strange sense 
                    of humour, Harry.
                          (shrugs)
                    You can stay out here.  I ve got 
                    work to do.

      He starts back into the office.

      Explosion!

      They are both thrown back.  They stagger to their feet and 
      look at the mayhem in the office where they both could have 
      been killed.
