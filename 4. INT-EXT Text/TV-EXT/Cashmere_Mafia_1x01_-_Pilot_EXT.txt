      Music up, The Pretenders  confident anthem  Brass in Pocket , 
    as you soar in on an approaching aerial shot of the iconic 
      Manhattan skyline, under the following narration, intimate 
    and conversational:

                                  NARRATOR (VO) 
                    I can t remember who first called 
                    them the Cashmere Mafia, but it 
                    stuck. Never to their faces, of 
                    course. They ve been friends since 
                    their days at the Columbia School 
                    of Business together...


      CAMERA SKIDS to a stop in front of a beautifully restored 
      brownstone on a block full of them. A driver, Sam, early 
      50 s, gets out of a MercedesS550and opens the rear door and 
      checks his watch as the narration and music continue--

                                  NARRATOR (VO) 
                    Zoe Burden s what they call a 
                    rainmaker...    


    Zoe puts her briefcase on the roof of the car and holds her 
      arms out at her sides as if at airport security--

                                  ZOE
                    They had oatmeal with syrup--

    Her driver, Sam, gives her a thorough spots-scan, wet-wipe in *
      hand, as she turns around--*

                                  SAM
                    All clear. We re late--

    She ducks in the car and he shuts the door and runs around 
      front and jumps in.

    The car accelerates off; her briefcase goes THUDDING off the 
      trunk; the car SQUEALS to a stop, reverses full speed, 
      SQUEALS to a stop by the briefcase. Zoe opens her door, 
      plucks the briefcase off the street, and they speed off 
      again.

                                  NARRATOR (VO)
                    Then there s Dylan Mason, Associate 
                    Publisher, Barnett-Nash Media 
                    Group...


      A classic building and a  desirable  address, limos and 
      private cars jockeying for pick-ups by the awning.

                    And the fourth is Caitlin Dowd, 
                    Senior VP for Marketing and 
                      Development for the cosmetics giant 
                    Chloe Parrish. 


      A classic Manhattan power lunch venue; deceptively casual in 
      appearance but bubbling daily with an only-in-New-York 
      trifecta of top-drawer media, financial, sports and 
      entertainment players. Zoe s Mercedes pulls up to the curb, 
    she steps out and intersects with Caitlin, cheek-kisses as 
      they head inside.

      A Greenwich Village Pre-K through 8. Find Eric, the lone male 
      among the gathering MOMS waiting for their children, as Luke 
      comes running up--

                                  ERIC
                          (into phone, oblivious)

    Zoe giving  just a second  and  one more second  semaphores 
    to the assembled, juggling between her two roles, as Luke 
      chatters away--

                        LUKEZOE
      I got a reading star! And Mommy s in a meeting honey, 
      guess what else!?so quickly, what else--

      I lost a tooth at lunch.Be sure you give it to Daddy 
                                                  for the Tooth Fairy. And put 
                                                  Daddy on?

      VICTORIA KEENER, mid-thirties, cute and sexy in her sprayed-
    on yoga togs, moves up beside him. Her son Jason, also 5, 
      wraps his arms around her legs.                                                                            21.


                                  VICTORIA
                    Nice day to take them to the park. 
                    Want to?

                                  LUKE
                    Dad? Mom wants to talk to you...

    He hands Eric the phone.

                                  ERIC
                    We re off to the park, I ll call 
                    you later.

    And snaps the phone shut. The four of them move off together--

      --as Zoe turns back to her meeting with determined bravado--

                                  ZOE
                    Okay then! Back on track!


      Luke and play-date Jason on the monkey bars; Eric and 
      Victoria stretched out in the grass nearby.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Jason! Careful not to kick!

    She rolls over closer to Eric, eyes him inquisitively.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    I bet our lives are a lot alike in 
                    some ways.

                                  ERIC
                    Like how?

                                  VICTORIA
                    Well, were both married to Type-A s 
                    who end up running on empty by the 
                    time they get home, no?

                                  ERIC
                    Your husband s a...

                                  VICTORIA
                    Director of South American Emerging 
                    Markets, Smith Barney. Eighty-hour 
                    weeks and a chronic case of jet-
                    lag. We get to it twice a month if 
                    we re lucky.

                                  ERIC
                    You re talking about getting to the 
                    theatre, right?

    She kicks him, playful.                                                                            22.


                                  VICTORIA
                    No, I m not talking about the 
                    theatre. I bet you can be 
                    absolutely infuriating.

                                  ERIC
                    Why?

                                  VICTORIA
                    This whole ironic-distance thing 
                    you ve got going on. It s very sort 
                    of charming but it makes you so 
                    hard to read.

                                  ERIC
                    Yeah, it s a cry for help.

                                  VICTORIA
                    See?

    She shifts a little closer.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Okay, here goes. The only safe 
                    affair is between two people who 
                    are married with young kids and 
                    committed to staying in those 
                    marriages. Nobody s going to fall 
                    in love; everybody just has a good 
                    time and goes home.

                                  ERIC
                    Like, friends with benefits.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Like that, yes. And please don t 
                    make a joke.

    He meets her gaze, unflinching, and smiles, genuine.

                                  ERIC
                    I won t. And if I m understanding 
                    you correctly, I m very flattered.
                    But here s the thing? I don t get 
                    nearly enough sex at home, either. 
                    But where I m kind of twisted? It 
                    means it never gets stale, it means 
                    I m in a kind of perpetual state of 
                    wanting her. 

    She smiles and nods, not so much in concession as in taking 
    up a gauntlet. A JINGLING MELODY sounds, off.

                                  VICTORIA
                    She s luckier than she knows.

                                  LUKE (OS)
                    Dad!? The ice cream truck!?

    He gets to his feet.                                                                            23.



      A white Jaguar XJ8 weaving in traffic and pulling up in front 
    of a soundstage building. You hear Caitlin, over:

                                  CAITLIN (VO)
                    ...it s not unlike what you were 
                    doing at Sony Music. Two-thirds of 
                    the job is launching new product, 
                      one-third s supporting the existing 
                    brands.

      Caitlin gets out the back, offers a hand to Alicia, who takes 
    it. They head to the entrance--


      Escalades and livery limousines idling out front of a hip-
      this-minute diner at dawn. 


      Lurching in traffic on Canal Street.                                                                            27.


                                  ZOE (OS)
                    Manuel, let s cut up Mercer to 
                    Houston?

      Pulls a quick illegal turn--


      Establishing. Toby Lightman s  Don t Wake Me  on the 
      soundtrack.


      Caitlin s Jaguar is idling at the curb, the driver, JIMMY, 
      late 20 s, outside smoking a cigarette.

                                  CAITLIN (VO)
                    Forgive me father for I have sinned 
                    it s been whatever since my last 
                    confession and these are my sins.


      Flags of a dozen nations hanging over the atrium entrance.


      Music continues as Zoe and Kate exit her car on the tarmac, 
      hand off their suitcases to the waiting STEWARD and board a 
      Gulfstream V.

                                  ZOE
                          (into cell phone)
                    Sasha, I ll be at your recital I 
                    promise double pinky swear now 
                    start your homework and put Daddy 
                    on...                                                                            34.



      Caitlin leaning over Patrick s shoulder and going over her 
      schedule on the monitor.                                                                            36.


                                  CAITLIN
                    ...then see if you can move the 
                    European sales meeting to four-
                    thirty...
                            (noticing--)

      ANOTHER ANGLE-CAITLIN S POV

      A strikingly handsome MAN with a stunning armful of flowers 
    on the opposite side of the floor, seen over the tops of the 
      cubicles, as an ASSISTANT points out a door to him and he 
      walks a little further and knocks and opens it and Alicia 
      steps into view and takes the flowers and wraps her arms 
      around him.

                                  PATRICK (OS)
                    It d mean starting market research 
                    no earlier than seven.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Caitlin, resigned. Story of my life.

                                  CAITLIN
                    That s okay, I m not going 
                    anywhere.


      Richard hurrying up the sidewalk, clearly late.


      Richard in golf attire, standing by his Mercedes SL55 as 
      Peter Johnson comes out with a golf bag slung over his 
      shoulder.

                                  PETER
                    Hey Ricardo! What a day for it, 
                    huh?

      Hearty handshakes. Richard takes his clubs and loads them 
      into the trunk.

                                  RICHARD 
                    I asked Eli Manning to join us, 
                    hope that s okay.

      Peter with a chuckling yeah-it s-okay high five as a BICYCLE 
      MESSENGER comes skidding up by the entrance and clocks their 
      attire--

                                  MESSENGER
                    Peter Johnson?

                                  PETER
                    You got him.

    The messenger reaches a couple of shrink-wrapped clubs 
      fastened to his backpack and hands them over.

                                  MESSENGER   
                      Compliments of Dylan Mason.

      Richard with a look like, fucking-a. 

                                  PETER
                    Great! Thanks!

      Slips him a five as Richard struggles to keep his game face 
    on.


      Dylan steps out of a town car, cell phone to her ear.                                                                            40.

                    He got the clubs? Fantastic! Thank
                    you...

      PULLING BACK, revealing Zoe and Caitlin stepping out of their *
      cars as well. Caitlin does a quick scope and winces.*

                                  CAITLIN
                    Jesus, Mary and Joseph; we re all 
                    wearing black.

    As indeed, they are.


      Music continues, over. A line of limousines, a phalanx of 
      PHOTOGRAPHERS, a swell CROWD pouring in. 

      PUSHING IN ON A LIMOUSINE PULLING UP -- the DRIVER opening 
    the rear door -- getting out one by one, Dylan, Zoe, Caitlin 
    and finally, in all her dressed-to-kill glory, Juliet.

    The other three flank her, steady her, forming an iconic 
      flying wedge, Reservoir Dogs meets Prada runway-- 

                                  JULIET
                    Don t pull me off  til he starts to 
                    turn blue.


      Music continues, as Zoe runs double-time down the sidewalk 
    and up the steps.


      Music continues, over and under. Caitlin and Alicia walk out 
      together, lit up with drinks and laughing. Caitlin s Jaguar 
    is waiting at the curb.

                                  CAITLIN
                    Can I drop you?

                                  ALICIA
                    I m meeting my brother for dinner 
                    in Brooklyn. I ll just take a 
                    taxi...

      A shy, charged shuffle; Caitlin takes her gently by the 
      elbows and brushes a kiss to both cheeks. 

                                  CAITLIN
                    This was fun. Good night...                                                                            52.


    But as she steps back, Alicia catches her eye with a 
      challenging, mischievous, unmistakably erotic look and 
      Caitlin s breath catches--

      --and Alicia steps up and kisses her full on the mouth. And 
      they melt together in a shyly passionate little shuffle right 
      there on the sidewalk--

      --as Cilla Grey passes by on her way in, recognizing Caitlin 
      with a look of surprise, quickly turning away and 
      disappearing inside, unnoticed by Caitlin. The kiss ends.

                                  CAITLIN (CONT D)
                          (after a moment, 
                            breathless)
                    I should tell you. I ve had a. 
                    Terrible time with men. And no real 
                      experience. With women. So I m kind 
                    of, you know. Flying without the 
                      instruments here and--

      Alicia silences her with another kiss.

                                  ALICIA
                    And I should tell you that you re a 
                    wonderful kisser. I m late, see you 
                    Monday...

    And with a last peck she runs off towards the avenue, hailing 
      a cab. Caitlin leans back against the wall, closing her eyes, 
      thrilled and scared all at once. 


      CAMERA crossing the street and PUSHING INSIDE. Max is our 
      narrator again, instructive--

                    Another thing about them? They 
                    rarely ask for favors, and when 
                    they do, we hop to it...
