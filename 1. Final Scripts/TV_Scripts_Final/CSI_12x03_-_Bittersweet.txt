                                      TEASER

  FADE IN:


1EXT. LAS VEGAS SKYLINE - NIGHT1*

    Flying over the strip, heading downtown.*


2INT. SIXTH STREET ART GALLERY - NIGHT2*

    CAMERA FLYING over extreme tight shots of TWISTED METAL,*
    JAGGED EDGES, ROUGH CEMENT.  It's dark, creepy.  We don't*
  know where we are or what we're looking at until the CAMERA*
  lands on NICK.  A disgusted look on his face.  We think we're*
  at a crime scene until --

                                  NICK*
                  Five grand?  For this?*

    CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing that we're not at a crime scene,*
  but in an ART GALLERY.  No paintings here.  Looks like the*
    artist was inspired by a junkyard.  Nick, dressed up for his*
  date with CALLIE (20s), hot, leather SKIRT.  She admires one*
  of the "TRASH ART" pieces -- in the form of a body, installed*
  on the floor, with a RUSTED FRYING PAN for a head.*

                                    CALLIE
                It speaks to me.

                                  NICK
                  What's it saying?

                                    CALLIE
                  Look at the face.  No expression.  

                                  NICK
                  It's a frying pan.  

                                    CALLIE
                  I think what the artist is trying
                to say is, we don't need to fear
                  death, because it's universal.  And
                in the end, we all find peace.  

                                  NICK
                  I've seen a lot of very unpeaceful
                  ends.  I think this artist needs to
                get out of the studio more.



                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Bittersweet" - 1203 - WHITE - 8/11/112.

2CONTINUED:2

                                    CALLIE
                          (smiling, then)
                  Come over here.  Tell me what you
                  see.

    Callie drags Nick through this crowd of PIERCED AND TATTED*
    HIPSTERS, everyone drinking red wine out of PLASTIC CUPS. *
  Past more TRASH ART SCULPTURES.  Landing at one made of*
    scavenged car parts, resembling TWO BODIES entwined in a
    grotesque embrace.

                                  NICK
                You getting hungry?  Nugget has a
                  great steak house.

                                    CALLIE
                  C'mon, Nick.  Give it a try.  

  Nick studies the art as if it were a corpse.  Finally --

                                  NICK
                  Muffler from a '59 Chevy.  Says to
                  me... car accident.

                                    CALLIE
                          (sighs, then)
                  Says to me, two people breaking
                  down the walls they've built around
                  their hearts.  Surrendering to their
                  innermost feelings. 

  Is she coming onto him?  

                                  NICK
                  Alright.  I can do a little curating.

  He walks over to a ANOTHER TRASH ART BODY, flying, suspended
  on CABLES and bathed in SPOTLIGHTS.  The SKULL is formed
  from crushed aluminum cans.  ONE ARM from terra cotta tiles. 
  The other encased in a CEMENT BLOCK.  [NOTE: Cables are
    attached to eye hooks drilled into the cement.]

                                  NICK
                Now this one, it's not just speaking
                to me, it's shouting.  The cement,
                the brick...  We all carry a load. 
                But if our burdens get too heavy,
                and we can't rise above them, life
                  will crush us... like a beer can.
                        (off her look)
                  That's all I got.




                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Bittersweet" - 1203 - WHITE - 8/11/113.

2CONTINUED:  (2)2

                                    CALLIE
                          (enthralled)
                  That was beautiful.

  Just then, a RED-BLACKISH LIQUID drips out from the eye-hook
  in the cement ONTO NICK'S CLEAN SHIRT.  She eyes the drip --

                                    CALLIE
                Oh, wow, it's interactive.

  Nick dabs at the stain, takes a whiff.  It's DECOMP.

                                  NICK
                  More than that.  It's the end of
                our date.

                                                                    WHITE FLASH TO:


3EXT. SIXTH STREET ART GALLERY - NIGHT (LATER)3

  Full blown crime scene.  CRIME TAPE surrounds the dripping
    artwork, dripping now into a PLASTIC CUP.  Nick, in just his
    T-shirt, does a HEMATRACE TEST on the dripping liquid --

                                    RUSSELL (O.S.)
                  Nice catch.

    CAMERA FINDS RUSSELL, staring at another CEMENT CUBE mounted
  on the wall nearby.  In the cement is an IMPRESSION of
    something that has caught his eye.  

                                  NICK
                        (re: test)
                  Definitely human.  
                        (re: dripping block)
                  Think there's a real arm in there?

    Russell reads the tag next to the cement cube: "Negativity
  by Slade".  $2200.

                                    RUSSELL
                For these prices?  I won't say it. 
                Oh, I'll say it... arm and a leg.

    Russell cranes his neck one way, then the other, trying to
    interpret the impression in the cement cube.

                                    RUSSELL
                So, Nick, which one is she?

                                  NICK
                  Hunh?



                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Bittersweet" - 1203 - WHITE - 8/11/114.

3CONTINUED:3

                                    RUSSELL
                        (re: evidence shirt)
                  Nice shirt, at least it used to be. 
                Art opening?  I mean, c'mon.  You
                had to be on a date.

    Russell looks up, scans the crowd, zeroes in on Callie.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Cute brunette.  Leather skirt?  

                                  NICK
                  She's Doc Robbins' niece.  Visiting
                  from Ohio.  Just showing her around.

                                    RUSSELL
                You can have a personal life, Nick. 
                  It's okay.

  Nick feels like he stepped in a trap.  Russell returns his
    attention to the cement cube mounted on the wall.

                                    RUSSELL
                  What do you see?

                                  NICK
                Aw, don't start.

    Russell puts his face into the impression of the cube.

                                  NICK
                  I wouldn't be putting my face in
                  there.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Okay.  You do it.  That's an order.

  Nick eyes Russell.  Is he serious?  His look says he is,
    gestures: "Go ahead."  Nick sticks his face into the cube. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  They say beauty is in the eye of
                the beholder.  I'm not saying this
                art is beautiful.  But I think you're
                  beholding half a face there.

  Nick pulls away from the cement, now sees what Russell sees.

                                  NICK
                  Nose.  Cheek.  Eye socket.  I see
                it.  

  Nick turns to Russell, but he's already scanning the rest of
  the gallery --


                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Bittersweet" - 1203 - WHITE - 8/11/115.

3CONTINUED:  (2)3

                                    RUSSELL
                Not saying I'd want this stuff in
                my house.  But I would like to see
                the rest of the collection.  
                        (turns to the crowd)
                Is there an artist in the house?

    A heavily TATTOOED MAN, SLADE, 20s, comes over to them.

                                  SLADE
                  Yeah. I'm the artist.  Slade.

                                  NICK
                And your last name?

                                  SLADE
                  Just Slade.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Okay.  Just Russell.  Just Stokes. 
                  Crime Lab.  Love what you're doing
                  here.  The cement is fresh... and
                  that hint of decomp.  What's your
                  process? 

                                  SLADE
                I'm an artist, man.

                                  NICK
                See that license plate over there? --

  Nick points to a mangled rear bumper masquerading as a dog.

                                  NICK

    Russell finds a HIBACHI.  It's rusty, but in decent shape. 
  He TAGS it and sets it aside.

                No, but electronics have serial
                  numbers.  Maybe one of our litterbugs

  Nick snaps a PICTURE, as Russell digs out another CEMENT
    BLOCK, no bigger than a Zappos box.  Russell turns over the*
    cement block, sees --*

    A YOUNG GIRL'S FACE

  Most of the head encased in the block.  But the dusty, semi-
    mummified face, crawling with bugs, is visible where the

    COLLEEN HUGHES, eyes vacant, in a NIGHTGOWN, tied to a metal
  bed frame.  Lying next to her, in sexy lingerie, is GINA
    SINCLAIR, late 20s, beautiful, intense.  A POMERANIAN BARKS*

                                    RUSSELL
                  Really?

                                    CATHERINE
                  Clearly, as a supervisor, I was too
                  close to my team.  I let one of
                  them walk into a house with a serial
                  killer.  You're here to make sure
                  that doesn't happen again.  

    A beat, as this sinks in.  But Russell's on the fence.

                                    RUSSELL
                  You've got a daughter, right?  

                                    CATHERINE
                  Yeah.

                                    RUSSELL
                So, you know.  With kids, can't
                  hold their hands their whole life.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Don't confuse Sara with your
                  children.  If she thinks justice
                  wasn't served, look out.
                        (then)
                And for the record, I've never 'let
                go' of my daughter's hand.  And I
                got a feeling, you hold on pretty
                  tight, too.  

  OFF Russell's look --


15EXT. NORTH LAS VEGAS UNDERPASS - DAY15*

    A "SHOOTERS" ALLEY, under the freeways.  COUPLE UNIFORMS*
  roust the last of the DRUNKS and DRUGGIES from the area,*
  while ANOTHER UNIFORM seals it off with CRIME TAPE.*

15CONTINUED:15

  FIND GREG grabbing his kit out of a DENALI.  For a trash run
  in a crack alley, he has a surprising bounce in his step. 
  As he rounds the front of the Denali, we see why --

  His partner in crime is MORGAN.  He falls in step with her
  as they both duck under the tape --

                                  GREG
                If you're homesick for L.A., this
                  will cure you.

                                    MORGAN
                        (re: scene)*
                I'm not this homesick.*

    A beat, then...*

                                    MORGAN
                  Listen, I'm not saying I'm one to*
                  date guys on the job, but -- Can I
                ask you a personal question?

                                  GREG
                  Absolutely.  Sure.

  His day just got even better.   

                                    MORGAN
                  I heard Nick was on a date with
                  Robbins' niece.  Know if it's
                  serious?  

  Just then, saving Greg from whiplash --

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                  Hey, guys.  Welcome to my third
                  trash run of the day. 

  Greg and Morgan turn to DAVID PHILLIPS, kneeling over a JOHN
  DOE.  Naked, heavy-set, acne'd skin, mid twenties, face down. *
  What looks like dirt under his nails and in his ears. 

                                    MORGAN
                  Guess I won't ask for I.D.

                                  GREG
                        (looks around)
                  Don't see his clothes.

                                    MORGAN
                  Picked clean.  In L.A., they at
                  least leave the underwear.

  David examines the body.  Feels the vertebrae... spine...
    neck... back of head.  He feels a crushed skull.  

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                  Blunt force trauma.

                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Bittersweet" - 1203 - WHITE - 8/11/1115.

  He pulls his hand away -- there's BLOOD on David's glove.

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                  Blood.  

                                  GREG
                But no blood pool. *

    Morgan notices dual lividity.  *

                                    MORGAN
                  Slight lividity on his back.  But
                  lividity's fixed in the lower
                    extremities.  

                                  GREG
                    Inconsistent with his current
                  position.

  Now, Morgan checks out the SOLES and HEELS of the vic's feet.  

                                    MORGAN
                No blanching on the soles of his
                  feet.  Weird.  Guy died standing
                up, but not standing on anything.  

                                  GREG
                  Maybe he was suspended.  Hung.

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                        (re: neck)
                  I don't see any ligature marks.  

    A beat, as they all consider this.  *

                                  GREG*
                  Roll him.*

  David struggles to roll him, Greg jumps in to help.*

                                  GREG
                  Pretty well fed for a junkie.  

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                No jaundice.  Don't see any track
                  marks.

                                    MORGAN
                  Check his teeth.

  David pries the mouth open.  Guy's got a perfect set of pearly
    whites.  Must've cost him a bundle.  And healthy gums.

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                  Wish I had pearlies like that. 
                  Beautiful gums.

                                  GREG
                Guy wasn't on the pipe.

                So, we can forget trash run.  He
                  didn't die here.  He was dumped. 
                Oh, this is good.  

  OFF Greg, if only Morgan was as excited about him --

  PAN OFF the BLOCK WITH THE FACE, BLOCK WITH THE ARM to FIND --

  -- All the RAVINE CEMENT BLOCKS, also containing dismembered
  body parts, laid out.  Nick and Sara, position the FLUOROSCOPE*
    against one of the blocks.  They flip a switch and as the*
    machine springs to life --  *


17CSI SHOT - FOLLOW THE BEAM17*

  from the machine, THROUGH the cement, INTO the DISMEMBERED
  BODY PART, illuminating an image of the young woman's ARM.  *


18BACK TO SCENE (MONTAGE)18

  -- ON the FLUOROSCOPE DISPLAY the position of the ARM in the*
  block is clearly visible.  BEGIN MONTAGE:*

  -- Nick and Sara FLUOROSCOPE each cement block.  Creating*
  more X-RAYS: LEGS, TORSO, HEAD.  Gradually filling the light*
    board.

  -- Using the FLUOROSCOPE IMAGES as a guide, Nick uses a*
    CONCRETE SAW to score a line around the block.  He uses a
  STONE CHISEL AND MALLET to tap along the scored line,
    splitting the block in half, like a clamshell.  Exposing the
  BODY PART inside.*

  -- Nick processes the ARM.  Uses a TOOTH PICK, scrapes under*
  the fingernails into a BINDLE.  Then snips the fingertips
  into a vial to do printing.

  -- Sara chips away at the cement covering the head.  She*
    removes the head then PHOTOS her empty cement "clamshell". *
  Spots SEVERAL FIBERS in the cement.  SNAP ZOOM TO:*

    Short, ultra thin glass rods, like fiber optic thread.

21INT. CORONER'S OFFICE - AUTOPSY ROOM "A" - DAY 21

    CAMERA PANS ACROSS the table, where we find the girl's body
  parts assembled like a macabre jigsaw puzzle.  LANDS ON -- 

  Nick, Sara and DR. ROBBINS looking down at the body. 

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Based on the lack of eruption of
                the wisdom teeth, I'd estimate she
                was twelve to fifteen years old.

                                  SARA
                  Like all the Sinclairs' victims.*

                                  DR. ROBBINS*
                  I sent her dental X-rays to Missing*
                  Persons.  Hopefully, it'll give us*
                an ID.*

                                  SARA
                  Evidence of sexual assault?*

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  I found significant vaginal trauma.
                  Possibly involving a foreign object.

                                  SARA
                  Gina used to use a beer bottle.

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Sent the SAE kit to DNA.  *

                  COD?

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Aside from the hack-job, no other
                  signs of obvious trauma.  Condition*
                of the body makes it hard to tell*
                  much of anything.

  Sara has now crossed to a COMPUTER MONITOR.  She's staring
  at AUTOPSY PHOTOS of the Sinclairs' prior victims.  *

                  Sinclairs' previous victims were*

                ... Leaving ragged edges, like
                  hamburger meat.  Tool marks are almost
                  identical to our cement girl.*

                                  SARA
                We never did figure out what the
                  Sinclairs used to cut up the bodies.*

                way anyone else could.  Same M.O.,
                  same tool -- says to me we're not
                  looking at a copycat.

22EXT. GINA SINCLAIR'S CONDO COMPLEX - DAY22*

  Sara gets out of her Denali, heads for the condo.  Stops
  when she spots --

    SARA'S POV: AN OLD, RUN DOWN, BLUE SEDAN

    parked across the street.  ED BURROWS (from vigilante website)
  at the wheel.  He's as disheveled and run-down as his car.

  Sara approaches, taps on the passenger window.  Burrows just
  keeps his eyes glued to the condo.  Sara opens the passenger
  door, sweeps away a pile of food wrappers so she can sit.


23INT. MR. BURROWS' CAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS)23

    Burrows still won't look at Sara.

                                  ED BURROWS
                I'm two hundred feet from her place.

  He offers her a MEASURING TAPE --

                                  ED BURROWS
                  Check for yourself.

                                  SARA
                I'm not here about the restraining
                  order.

                                  ED BURROWS
                  Heard you found another body.

  Sara surveys the car, discarded take-out containers, clothes. 
    CAMERA with telephoto lens and binoculars on the floor.

                  going to stand by and do nothing. 

  This is a man at the end of his rope.

                                  SARA
                Go home.  Make up with your wife. 
                Let us do our job.

  Sara gets out of the car.  Stares down Burrows.  A beat,
    then... Burrows starts up his car and drives off.  OFF Sara,
    feeling for this father who lost his daughter.


24EXT. GINA'S CONDO COMPLEX - POOL AREA - DAY24

  PICK UP Sara entering a complex where FAMILIES and teenage
  GIRLS are sunbathing and playing in the pool.  She spots --  

  GINA SINCLAIR, 30s, killer body, flower earrings, drinking a*
  BEER as she soaks up rays on a lounge chair with a POMERANIAN. 
  Gina exudes a cool confidence.  Sara stands in front of her,
    blocking Gina's sunlight.  Her pomeranian BARKS at her.

                  Care for a cold one?

  Sara doesn't take the bait.

                                  SARA
                  Look good, Gina.  Guess prison agreed

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*

  in bikinis, frolicking in the pool.

                                  SARA
                Am I blocking your view?

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                  Just admiring the flowers.

    Sara's had enough.  She steps into the center of the
    courtyard, addressing the whole complex: sun worshippers,
    PEOPLE on their balconies, everyone...

                                  SARA
                  Excuse me, can I have your attention
                  please?  I'm with the Las Vegas
                  Police Department.  I don't know if
                you know this, but your neighbor
                  over here, Gina Sinclair, Apartment*
                  310...  She's a rapist and a
                  murderer.  And if I were you, I'd
                  keep an eye on your kids.

  The whole complex looks at Gina, concerned.  Sara shoots
  Gina a "fuck you" look, more determined than ever to put her
  back behind bars --

                                  SARA
                Get up.  I'm calling your parole
                  officer.  Let's see what kind of
                  mess your maid left.

                                                                            FADE OUT.

25INT. CSI - LAYOUT ROOM - DAY25

  PAN ACROSS a VICTIM BOARD, displaying PHOTOS of the Sinclairs'*
    victims, along with THUMBNAILS of EVIDENCE REPORTS, FIELD
    INVESTIGATIONS, etc.  FIND Sara waiting.  A beat, then Russell
    enters, with a TRANS EX SHIPPING BOX.  *

                                    RUSSELL
                  Sorry to make you wait.  Got a

                          (shakes it)
                  I think I know what it is.

                          (cutting through the bullshit)
                And I think I know why I'm here.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Perfect.  So you went to interview
                  a suspect and in front of seventy-
                  five neighbors, called her a rapist,
                  murderer --

                                  SARA
                -- And psycho.  But that was to her
                  face.  Her neighbors have a right
                to know.

    Russell is opening his shipping box...

                                    RUSSELL
                Her lawyer called, threatened to
                sue the department and you for
                  harassment.  Which he has a right
                to do.

  Sara knows he's right, she crossed the line --

                                  SARA
                You should've seen her, tanned and
                  toned.  Sipping a beer by the pool. *
                  Checking out all the young girls.*

    Russell pulls a WLVU BASKETBALL JERSEY out of the box.  The
  name RUSSELL on the back, number 8.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Look at that.

                                  SARA
                Are we done?

                                    RUSSELL
                My son's a freshman on the WLVU
                  team.  Point guard.  Practiced every
                day since he was six.  In junior
                  high, practiced every night 'til
                  late.  Wanted to walk home.  Only
                  half a mile.  I wouldn't let him. 
                One of us always picked him up.  

  Sara holds his look, what is he talking about?

                                    RUSSELL
                  A kid should be able to walk home
                  from school.  At any hour.  

    Russell turns to the PHOTOS on the board.  His tone shifts --

                                    RUSSELL
                  These girls should've been able to
                  walk home.  I want the Gina Sinclairs*
                of the world off the street, too. 
                        (off her look)
                But to do that, we have to be smarter
                  than them.  

                                  SARA
                  Just taking her temperature.

                                    RUSSELL

                        (then)
                  Sara, you showed your hand.  To a
                  master manipulator... your words.

                                  SARA
                She did it.  Five years ago.  And
                  three weeks ago.  And she's going
                to do it again.

                                    RUSSELL
                And maybe now get away with it. 
                  Again.  
                        (then)
                  We're evidence, too.  It's not just
                  a fiber you bindle that goes into a

                And Gina Sinclair made you lose today*
                  with a jury of seventy-five people.

    A beat, as that lands.

                                    RUSSELL
                  I want to win.  Like I tell my kid,
                you win between the ears.

26EXT. LAS VEGAS SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING - DAY26


27INT. CORONER'S OFFICE - AUTOPSY ROOM "A" - DAY27

  John Doe is Y'd and DR. ROBBINS is removing the chest plate. 
    Morgan next to him.  

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                ... Good call on the dual livor
                  mortis.  

                                    MORGAN
                  Thanks.  Didn't get this job because
                of nepotism.

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Never crossed my mind.

  Just then, Greg pushes in -- they started without him.

                                  GREG
                Am I late?

                                    MORGAN
                No, I'm always early.

  As Robbins lifts the CHEST PLATE, he notices the LUNGS are
  oddly distended -- 

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Don't see this too often.  Lungs
                are distended. 

  Dr. Robbins presses on the lungs.

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  They should feel like deflated
                  balloons.  These feel more like...
                  pillows.  But heavy.  

  As Morgan reaches over and feels them for herself --

                                    MORGAN
                  Awesome. 

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Let's see how much they weigh.

  Dr. Robbins takes a scalpel and cuts the BRONCHIAL TUBE. 
    Suddenly, THICK MILK CHOCOLATE COLORED LIQUID oozes out.

                                  GREG
                  Whoa...

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  That looks like...

    Morgan dips a gloved finger into the liquid, takes a whiff --

                                    MORGAN
                  Chocolate.  Guy's a souffle.

    A beat, as they all mull this, then --

                                  GREG
                  Lungs full of chocolate.  Lividity
                in the lower extremities.  Died
                  vertical.  But not on his feet. 
                And not hung.  

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Victim was floating?  

                                    MORGAN
                  Doc, can a person drown in chocolate?


28INT. CSI - RUSSELL'S OFFICE - DAY28

  Greg and Morgan brief Russell on their "chocolate" John Doe. 
  He's watering his orchid --

                                    RUSSELL
                Was it milk or dark chocolate?

                                    MORGAN
                  Really?  That's your first question?

                  tell her this story.

                                  GREG
                We sent chocolate samples to Hodges.

                        (still watering)
                How much did the guy weigh?

  Greg and Morgan swap a look.  Another seeming non-sequitur.

                                  GREG
                Ah, two-twenty-one.  Give or take a
                  little fudge.

                He drowned in chocolate.  Who cares
                  about his vitals.

                  Five-ten.

    Russell stops watering.  Still holding the sprayer, he starts
  to HAND MIME the rough shape of the vic in the air.  Finally --

                                    RUSSELL
                I'm thinking... at least... hundred
                  plus gallons --
                        (off their looks)
                -- You said he drowned in chocolate. 
                He didn't drown in a candy bar. 

  Now, they get it.

                                  GREG
                He drowned in a lot of chocolate.

33EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY33

    Russell talks to COLLEEN HUGHES, 21, pretty but fragile. 
  Her physical scars may have healed but in her eyes, the pain
  is still there.  Colleen is wearing a waitress uniform.  

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                ... I can't believe they let her out.

    A rush of fears and memories come flooding back.

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                  Where is she?

                                    RUSSELL
                As a condition of her parole, she
                has to stay in Vegas.  

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                Of course she does.  So what, now
                  she's free and I have to hide? 

                                    RUSSELL
                No one's saying you have to hide. 
                But for now, it might be good if
                you move back in with your parents --

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                No way.  You have any idea what
                  it's like to live with parents who
                  thought their kid was dead.  Then...
                  They didn't let me breathe without
                  them for the last four years.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Maybe you have a friend you could
                  stay with.

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                  I don't have friends.  Cause I don't
                  trust anyone.  Shrinks call it PTSD.
                  I say once you've been chained to a
                bed and raped every day for eleven
                  hundred and twelve days... it's
                  better to be alone.

                                    RUSSELL
                  I could see about police protection.

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                No.  Why don't you send the cops
                  over to her place.  I can take care
                of myself.  I'm done being a victim.

    Russell pulls out his CARD, writes numbers on the back.

  She takes the card.  Takes a look from the MANAGER --

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                  I got to get back to work.

  She moves off.  OFF Russell's look.

                                    MORGAN
                  More like inhaling it.  According

                  your Argentinean Virgin Honey Bee
                  chocolate.

                  She's found another Todd.  Weak,
                  someone easily controlled.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Let's go back to 'weak'.  Because
                  that just may be your ticket out of
                the doghouse.

                                  SARA
                  Find the weak link, nail Gina.

    Russell nods.  Just then, his pager goes off.  He checks the
    display, curious.  Then eyes Sara.

                  Just to hear her voice. She wasn't
                  there last night.  Or this morning. 
                  I called the Cafe, she didn't show
                up for work.  So I went over to her
                  house.  That's when I found this --

  She hands Russell his CARD.

                                  MRS. HUGHES*
                  What's going on?

                  I could feel it.  I knew something

                She has her.

                  Greg and I searched his place.

    Morgan pulls PHOTOS from a FILE, gets sticky fingers on them --*

                        (mouth full)
                  Sorry.

  Nick eyes the PHOTOS, featuring empty boxes of chocolate,
  empty chocolate candy wrappers, etc.  

                                    MORGAN
                Guy was drowning in chocolate. 
                  Before he was drowning in chocolate.
                  Could be why he was hitting up Sinful
                  Pleasures for a job.  You know what
                  they say about loving your work.

  Just then, Greg enters, with the victim's LAPTOP.

                                  GREG
                  I love my work, too.  Chocolate
                  wasn't Chad's only obsession.  

  Greg sets the laptop down on the desk, turns the screen toward
  Nick and Morgan --

                                  GREG
                  Archie unlocked Chad's laptop.

                                  GREG
                  Chad had more than a thousand images

  Greg hits a couple keys, bringing up the first of the images.

    Morgan focuses in on the model's eyes -- they're amber.

                                    MORGAN
                  Eyes are amber.
                        (off Nick's look)
                  Photos we saw at the factory were
                all black and white.

  As Morgan's eyes move to the DMV PHOTO of the victim, Nick*
  is right with her --

                                  NICK
                  Victim's eyes are amber.  In order
                to get amber eyes, you need two
                  recessive genes.  One from mom, one
                  from dad.

                                  GREG
                  Amber eyes are typically found in
                  less than one percent of the
                  population.  

                                    MORGAN
                One in a hundred shot.

                                  NICK
                How about one in one.  Pull up Chad
                  Ellis' old DMV records.*

  Greg, on the same wavelength, grabs Morgan's laptop and logs*
  onto the DMV DATABASE. 

    INSERT THE LAPTOP SCREEN: Chad Ellis' DRIVING HISTORY*

    A RECENT PHOTO and an ORIGINAL PHOTO -- taken when Chad was

                  Whoaa.  It's the same guy.  

                                    MORGAN
                  That is so depressing.  Guy gained
                  a hundred pounds and lost his looks.

                                  NICK

                His photos are all over your factory.

  Angie reacts, confused, as Greg now slaps down a PHOTO OF
  THE ADONIS BURSTING OUT OF CHOCOLATE.

                                  ANGIE SALINGER
                  That's Tristan Duran.  Now him, I*

                                    MORGAN
                So you can confirm the birthmark on
                his left butt cheek?  In the shape
                of Rhode Island?

                  Well, Chad Ellis had the same*
                  birthmark.  Only now it's the size
                of Texas.  

  Angie hears what they're saying, but it doesn't compute.

                It was just a fling.  I moved on. 
                He moved on.  Heard he got a job
                  walking the runways in Milan --

                  Don't think he walked them too long. 
                  Like your ad, he dipped into the

                Ate his way out of a career.  Broke, 
                  modeling days over, he came to you
                  looking for a job.  Any job --

                  I think you did.  He drowned in

51INT. CSI DENALI - DAY (TRAVELING)51

    Russell driving, Sara riding shotgun. ON THE RADIO, a book
  on tape plays: 

                                  SARA
                  Book on tape.  Really?

                                    RUSSELL
                In Cold Blood.  It calms me.

                                  SARA
                I'd be a lot calmer if I could turn
                it off.

                                    RUSSELL
                I'd be a lot calmer if you were a

    Russell turns it off.


52EXT. GINA SINCLAIR'S CONDO COMPLEX - DAY (LATER)52*

    Denali pulls up.  Russell and Sara get out.  Sara shoots a
  look across the street, clocks Burrows' sedan.  No Burrows.  

                                  SARA
                  Burrows' car.

                                    RUSSELL
                No Burrows.

    Something's not right.  Suddenly, they hear a WOMAN'S SCREAM!
  Is it Colleen?  They rush toward the building.  Sara pulls
  her gun.  Russell pulls his cell --

                                    RUSSELL
                  Control, Charlie-Zero-One-Russell.

53INT. GINA'S CONDO - DAY (CONTINUOUS)53

  The door is closed, but splintered. Pushes open, Sara steps
  in, leading with her gun.  Russell behind her.  Their eyes
    immediately lock on --  

    REVERSE ANGLE

  Not Colleen, but a BLOODIED and BEATEN GINA SINCLAIR tied to*
    a chair.  An enraged Ed Burrows over her, KNIFE to her throat. 
  BG, Pomeranian BARKING.  Gina looks to our CSIs, pleading --  

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                  Shoot him!

  Sara levels her gun --

                                  SARA
                Mr. Burrows, drop the knife!

    Burrows is startled but doesn't comply.

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                  SHOOT HIM!

                                  SARA
                Mr. Burrows, please, don't do this --

                                    RUSSELL
                  This won't bring your daughter back.

                        (in tears)
                She cut my little Jenny into pieces. 

    Suddenly, Officer Mitchell and UNI appear in the doorway,
  guns out.

                                    OFFICER MITCHELL
                Put the knife down or I will shoot
                  you!

    Burrows doesn't budge. Mitchell is about to fire, when Russell
  puts a hand out to Mitchell --

                                    RUSSELL
                We got this.

  He looks to Sara, who closes the distance with Burrows --

                                  SARA
                Mr. Burrows, Colleen Hughes is
                  missing.  And she's the only one
                who knows where she is.  

    Tension.  All guns on Burrows.  He's deeply conflicted.

  So close to having his revenge, yet --

                                  SARA
                  Colleen has parents, too.  You need
                to help us.  Please.  Put the knife
                  down.  

  Sara holsters.  Takes a step toward him, hand outstretched.

                                  SARA
                  It's okay.

    Burrows holds Sara's look, places the knife in her hand.  IN
  an instant, Officer Mitchell and the UNI take him down.  As
  they put Burrows in CUFFS --  

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                        (to Sara)
                  Thank you.

  Sara says nothing, turns away.  Walks out past Russell. OFF
    Russell, watching her go.

                                                                            FADE OUT.

55INT. CSI - GARAGE - DAY 55

  Not a gun.  But a BLAST OF HIGH-INTENSITY WATER, cleaving
  into a RAW PORK SHANK (locked in a vise).  As the pork shank
    EXPLODES INTO the fat, muscle and bone --


56CSI SHOT - WE DIVE INTO THE PORK SHANK56

  along with the water.  We see the MOLECULES OF WATER IMPACTING
  THE FAT, MUSCLE AND BONE.  RIPPING AWAY chunks of tissue and
    splinters of bone, and carrying them away with the water. 
  Until the water obliterates all the material, leaving RAGGED,
    SHREDDED EDGES between the now TWO HALVES of pork shank.


57BACK TO SCENE 57

    REVEAL Nick, in TYVEK COVERALLS and FACE SHIELD, surrounded
  by a VISQUINE CURTAIN.  He's holding an INDUSTRIAL PRESSURE
    WASHER wand, the source of the water.  He shuts off the
    machine.  Raises his FACE SHIELD.  Examines the ragged cuts
  in the pork.  And compares them to AUTOPSY PHOTOS of the 
    Sinclairs' prior dismembered victims.  *

  Just then, Sara enters, looking a bit ragged herself.

                  Maybe not this time.  Hodges found
                  traces of Sodium Metasilicate and

                You think they used a pressure washer

                        (off his nod)
                  Only we never found any soap trace
                in the original case.

                                  NICK
                Got a theory on that, too.  And
                  you'll like it.  Gina messed with
                the girls, but never messed with
                any pressure washer.  That was Todd's
                  job.

                He knew to wash off the soap.  Gina
                  missed that step.  Or whoever she's
                  teamed up with now.
                        (then)
                So she has access to a pressure

    Russell, carrying a bag of FAST FOOD, pushes in.  The N.D.
  UNI, posted at the door, squints at the bag.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Thought Mr. Burrows might be hungry. 
                Get yourself a cup of coffee.

  Uni nods and exits, as Russell drops the bag on the table
  and takes a seat across from Burrows.

                  Burger and fries.  Better than the

    Burrows eyes him, suspicious.  But digs in and starts eating.

                  place.  Wasn't there.  Someone's
                  sitting on it.  Got a broadcast out
                on his van.

                  Hodges ran the fibers I pulled from
                the cement blocks.  Said it was
                  fiberglass.  Type used in auto body
                  repair.  Also boats. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  Four kids growing up in Seattle, we
                  spent a lot of time on the water. 
                And time off it.  My least favorite
                  part.  Getting the boat ready for
                  storage.  Winterizing it.  Don't
                  guess you get much winter here...

                                  NICK
                ... But we do have a Lake and a lot

                And before you store them, what do
                you do?

                                  NICK

  TRACK FAST ACROSS BOATS, stacked in dry dock.  Suddenly,*
  Nick, Sara, and a couple of UNIS ENTER FRAME, moving fast,*

  They pass by a WHITE VAN.  Nick reads the plate --*

  Nick pulls his gun, looks inside the van.  It's empty.  *

  Just then, Officer Mitchell appears --*

                                    OFFICER MITCHELL*
                  There's a warehouse around back. *
                For lease.  Looks abandoned.*

                  They've got to be there.*

  They all draw guns --*


63INT. MARINA/WAREHOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)63

  Nick, Sara, Officer Mitchell and the Unis enter the warehouse*
  and move through the darkness --*

    A FAINT LIGHT at the rear of the warehouse.  They pass OLD*
    FIBERGLASS BOAT MOLDS.  See BAGS OF CEMENT on a wooden pallet. *
    Stacks of old BOXES obscure their view, as they stealth*
    forward.  Suddenly, we HEAR --

  The HIGH PITCHED BARK of a DOG.  And then, a girl CRYING. 
  Maybe Colleen's still alive.  Officer Mitchell gives hand
    signals to the Unis, telling them to fan out.  As they do,
  they HEAR --

                                    WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                  Don't cry.  Last sip is yours.  

  Nick and Sara swap a look.  Who is that?  Can't be Gina.

                                    WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                You want to be a good girl, don't
                  you?  Say it.  "I want to be a good
                  girl."  

  More SOBBING.  Nick and Sara push through the darkness. *
    There's old BLOOD SPATTERED VISQUINE hanging in front of*
  some METAL SHELVES, obscuring their view.  As they come around*
  the shelves they finally see --*

    A YOUNG GIRL, VICKY (13), in a NIGHTGOWN, tied to a bed. 
  Lying next to her, wearing LINGERIE and holding a BEER BOTTLE
  is... Colleen Hughes.  VIDEO TAPING it all is Ryan Thomas. *
    A POMERANIAN leashed in a corner.*

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                  Such a pretty girl.  Such a good
                  girl.

    Colleen kisses Vicky on the cheek, caresses her with a beer
    bottle.  PUSH IN -- on Sara and Nick as this horrible*
    realization hits them -- the victim has become the abuser. *

                                    OFFICER MITCHELL
                  Police!  On the ground!  Now!

  Ryan tries to run, but a Uniform quickly subdues him. Colleen*
    doesn't move.  Sara watches, still in shock, as Officer Mitchell*
  pulls Colleen off the bed.  Colleen resists, distraught.   *

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                Get off me!  Don't touch me!

  Nick moves to Vicky, who's shaking and sobbing.*

                                  NICK
                  It's alright.  You're going to be
                  alright.

  Nick cuts the ROPE LIGATURES that bind Vicky to the bed. 
  Vicky hugs Nick, grateful to be alive.

  As Nick comforts her...

  ANGLE ON SARA

  as Colleen is cuffed and muscled past her.  Their eyes meet.

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                  I wanted to give Gina another flower. 
                I'm a good girl.  

  OFF Sara's speechless horror --


64EXT. LAS VEGAS SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT64*

  The lights shimmering, but somehow dimmer.


65INT. DESERT PALM HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT65*

  Sara sits on a bench outside Colleen's room.  Uni posted at
  the door. THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see Colleen shackled with
    four-point restraints to the bed, in a heavily sedated state.   
  Next to her, a tearful Mrs. Hughes confers with the DOCTOR.  

    Finally, she exits and joins Sara, who stands.

                                  MRS. HUGHES*
                The Doctor says victims sometimes
                  identify with their abusers.  Colleen
                is who she is because of what Gina
                  Sinclair did to her.*

  Both women are struggling to come to terms with this.

                                  SARA
                  Colleen was at a critical age when
                she was abducted.  Just starting to
                  develop her personality.  

                                  MRS. HUGHES*
                  I thought it was a miracle, a gift,
                  that she survived.  And now --

  She looks into the room at Colleen, then --

                                  MRS. HUGHES*
                How do I protect her from herself?

  Sara has no answer for her.  A beat, then Mrs. Hughes goes
  back into the room and sits with her daughter.  Just then,
  Sara feels a presence and looks up to see --

  Gina, carrying a bouquet of SUNFLOWERS, walking toward her. 
  Gina is bruised and bandaged.

                                  SARA
                  What are you doing here?

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                  Same thing you are.  

                                  SARA
                  Keep walking.  You come anywhere
                  near Colleen, I'll arrest you for
                  violating the terms of your parole.

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                  You're wrong about me, Sara.  You've
                  always been wrong about me.  Hope
                  you're sorry.

                                  SARA
                  I am.  Sorry for Colleen.  For
                  Jennifer.  Sorry for all those girls.
                And all their families.  All the
                  lives you ruined.  

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                  I served my time.  I think you need
                to accept that and move on.   

  Gina shoves the sunflowers into Sara's hands and turns to
  walk away.

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                  Tell Colleen I was here.  I'm
                  thinking about her.

  Sara watches her, barely able to contain her fury, knowing
  she's untouchable.  Sara turns and walks in the other
    direction, dumping the flowers in the nearest trash can.   

  As she approaches the Nurse's Station, several Unis crowded
    around it.  They part to REVEAL --

    Russell, seated on the bench at the end of the hall.  Waiting
  for her.  Who knows how long.  Sara's surprised to see him. 
  He walks over to her.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Have you eaten?

                                  SARA
                  I need to go home. 

                                    RUSSELL
                          (ignoring)
                  Yeah, I'm hungry, too.  You like
                  Italian?
                        (off her silence)
                  Chinese?... Greek?... Sushi?... I
                  will keep going.  

  In spite of herself, Sara cracks the faintest smile.

                                  SARA
                How about eggs?

                                    RUSSELL
                  Eggs are good.  

  As they walk off --

                                    RUSSELL
                  Can't talk you into egg drop soup?

                                  SARA
                No.
