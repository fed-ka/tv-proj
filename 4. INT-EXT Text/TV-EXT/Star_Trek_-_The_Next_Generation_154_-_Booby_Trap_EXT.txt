3B   A PAIR OF HANDS (OPTICAL) 
 
 pick up two half coconuts with two straws in them. As 
 it moves... pull back to reveal GEORDI's the one 
 holding them and he's sitting on a blanket on the sand 
 with a very attractive young woman (CHRISTY) ... a 
 decided tension in the air. 
 
     GEORDI 
   Another Coco-no-no? 
 
     CHRISTY 
   No thanks, I think I've had enough 
   already. 
 
     GEORDI 
   Yeah, me too. 
 
 And he has these two coconuts in his hand... looks 
 around with what to do with them. Finally, just sort 
 of drops them off to the side. He snaps his finger 
 and a GYPSY VIOLIN PLAYER MATERIALIZES beside them... 
 startling Christy. Geordi desperately wants to find 
 the courage to make his move. The gypsy begins to play 
 romantic music. Finally, awkwardly, attempting to be 
 casual, he moves closer to her... raises...

 toward her shoulder... he hasn't touched her yet...

 comfortable but isn't. Slowly...

7    GEORDI AND CHRISTY 
 
     GEORDI 
    (tense) 
   What? 
 
     CHRISTY 
   I'm sorry. I think I better go 
   back now. 
 
     GEORDI 
   You're chilly... ? I can turn down 
   the breeze... 
 
     CHRISTY 
   No, it's been a lovely program, 
   and you're a terrific guy... 
 
     GEORDI 
    (knows what's coming) 
   Yeah... 
 
     CHRISTY 
   I just don't feel that way about 
   you... 
 
     GEORDI 
   Yeah... 
 
 The gypsy violinist plays his soul out... irritatingly 
 loud. 
 
     GEORDI 
   Knock it off. 
 
 The music continues. 
 
     COMPUTER VOICE 
   Do you require full termination

 On Geordi's frustrated sigh... 
 
 
 as the Enterprise alters course. The space debris 
 speeds by -- some fragments dangerously close.

     PICARD (V.O.) 
   Captain's log, Stardate 43799.1. 
   We have arrived at Orelious Nine, 
   to chart the battle in which the 
   Menthars and Promellians fought 
   to their mutual extinction. Among 
   the ruins we have found a relic: 
   a Promellian battle cruiser that 
   has withstood the centuries. 
 
 
 The two vessels lie motionless in close proximity to 
 one another. 
 
 
 
 As before. 
 
 
 A multiple stream of phaser fire fans out in one 
 direction. 
 
54   ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL) 
 
 Phaser fire strikes the debris. The debris absorbs 
 the fire. 
 
 
 In space. The Promellian cruiser lying dead near it. 
 
 
 Time transition. 
 
 
 as the impulse engines flare to life and almost 
 immediately shut down. The ship slowly starts to move.

 as a tiny lateral thruster fires and the ship gently 
 shifts course. A large chunk of asteroid looms ahead. 
 
 
 gradually adjusting course and gliding silently past 
 the asteroid. 
 
 
 heading straight for the massive asteroid and picking 
 up speed. 
 
 
 as a thruster BLASTS to life. The ship, still gaining 
 speed, slowly changes course -- and instead of 
 colliding with the asteroid, it whips around it -- the 
 slingshot effect flinging the Enterprise on a new 
 course, completely out of the debris field. 
 
 
 FIRING a spread of torpedoes that explodes at the 
 ancient vessel... and the entire area goes white with 
 the explosive force obliterating the entire asteroid 
 field.

 As it moves off to explore other worlds...
