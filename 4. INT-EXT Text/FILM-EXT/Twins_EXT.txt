Werner. The ocean spread out below them is vast and
empty. This island is far from anywhere.

You've been here since you were a

Julius -- please -- don't get
your hopes up. Your brother
doesn't even know you exist.
Julius gets in the boat and casts off. The boat takes off
like a streak. Julius, in perfect rhythm, increases the
pace. The boat is almost flying across the water.
JULIUS

meeting their mother.
JULIUS
It's very beautiful, isn't it,
