      Traffic moves briskly on this highway just outside CHICAGO.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    So many people.  Heading to school.  
                    Late for work.  Just singing along.  
                    Living their lives.

      From the shoulder, a LONE DEER peers out at the cars and 
      noise.  And the woman continues to speak to us:

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    None of them sees me.  They don t 
                    even know that I m here.

      Startled, the deer bolts from the shoulder and back towards 
      some NEARBY WOODS.  We follow.


      The young woman here.  On a slab in an open drawer.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    And now I m here.  In a drawer.  In 
                    the dark.  Day after day I ve been 
                    waiting.  Not waiting to be 
                    saved...

      A CORONER makes some final notations on a clipboard.  He 
      slides the drawer closed, one among many.                                                                                        2.



                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Waiting to be found.

      A small ID slot marks the outside of the cabinet.  Written on 
      it:  JANE DOE.  The Coroner shuts off the light.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Loud and gritty and action-packed.  PIMPS chained to desk 
      chairs, inappropriate sexual banter among co-workers, 
      somebody bleeding. 

      Watching and leaning against the front counter, but very much 
      on the other side of it: ALEX DONOVAN (30s).  Handsome and 
      winning, but the passion underneath trumps all.  

      Having seen all of this before, and been in the middle of 
      half of it, he watches with amusement as a biggish female 
      DESK CLERK doesn t even look up from her paperwork.

                                  DESK CLERK
                    You miss it, Alex?

                                  ALEX
                    I miss you.  Sexy.

      She smirks but still doesn t look up.  Alex sees DETECTIVE 
      GRACE OLIVO (20s) walking over.  She s city tough but has a 
      soft spot for the man opposite.  She hands him a file.

                                  DET OLIVO
                     Highway Jane.   Here it is.

                                  ALEX
                    Here she is.  She s a person, 
                    Grace.  Did I teach you nothing?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Right.  Sorry.

      She s not being sarcastic, she just forgot how particular he 
      gets over such things.  He s looking through the file.

                                  ALEX
                    Five days and she s in the ground?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Yeah.  Keep in touch, all right?  
                    And thank you.

      He offers a reassuring smile.

                                  ALEX
                    I m late for court.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Witness or defendant?                                                                                      3.



      He walks out the door--


      Empty seats, some low-level matter.  Alex stands before the 
      weary JUDGE (female).

                                  JUDGE
                    Mr. Alex Donovan.  You know this 
                    fine individual?

      Seated at the defendant s table: TYLER DAVIES (early 20s), 
      lean and raggedly handsome, guilty of something, unhappy in 
      his only suit. 

                                  ALEX
                    It s personal, your honor.  I mean, 
                    it s not  it s personal  like  I 
                    can t tell you,  I mean it s not 
                      professional.  I was in Homicide 
                    for seven years, a uniform for five 
                    before that.  I didn t know him 
                    there.  Did that make sense?  

                                  JUDGE
                      Eventually.

                                  ALEX
                    I ve known Tyler since he was--
                          (turns to someone)
                    --you were six, right?

      Tyler just stares at Alex, expressionless.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    First grade.  At Newport Prep.  My 
                    wife, at the time, was a teacher s 
                    aide there.  We became friends with 
                    the family, with Lars and Brenda...

                                  JUDGE
                    This is fascinating.

                                  ALEX
                    All I m saying, your honor, is that 
                    Tyler s a good kid.  He completed 
                    an alcohol abuse program--

                                  JUDGE
                    Which clearly didn t take.

                                  ALEX
                    True.  But he has so much 
                      potential.  The artisticness is 
                    bursting out of him.

                                  JUDGE
                    Onto the overpass at State Street.  
                    In several different colors of 
                    spray paint.                                                                                      4.



                                  ALEX
                    Exactly.  Which is why we need to 
                    find a way to channel that energy.

      Alex takes a few steps towards the judge.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    May I approach?

                                  JUDGE
                    You are approaching.

      As Alex and the Judge confer, Tyler watches with interest 
      from his seat...


      Middle class, quiet.  A BABY sleeps in a crib.  LINDA MANNING 
      (late 30s), looks out from a window at the world.  Single 
      minded, sharp focus, hard shell.  We ll learn why.

      She s looking at something in particular: an AMAZON BOX, 
      halfway up her front walk.  She can feel herself tensing up.  
      If she could will it into the house, she would.

                                  LINDA
                          (to herself)
                    It s four steps.

      Finally she takes a deep breath and heads                                                                                      5.



      OUTSIDE

      to retrieve it, quick focused steps--

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    One two three four...

      It s all going well, but then as she bends to grab it the 
      WORLD GOES HAYWIRE as she wavers, sounds get loud and crazy, 
      neighbors stare and whisper, her heart THUMPS in her chest... 

      She scrambles to pick it up, almost stumbling as she grabs it 
      finally, then turns and RUNS back inside.


      She s drained.  The PHONE is ringing.  She rushes in to 
      answer it, tearing open the box as she speaks.

                                  LINDA
                          (into phone)
                    Alex-- you got it?  

      She jots something down on the cardboard flap, sounding 
      commanding and unafraid, contrary to what we ve just seen...

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    That works.  I ll let them know.

      She hangs up.  Tearing off the note, leaving the box, we see 
      what s inside: GROCERIES.  She moves to her 

      LIVING ROOM

      which is more of a great room-- couch and TV, plus a dining 
      area, then a little work area in the corner: desktop 
      computer, filing cabinets, an empty CORKBOARD.  Some kind of 
      home business.  Or something else.  She sits down at the 
      computer and calls up an INSTANT MESSAGE WINDOW--


      A large WOMAN (40s) blows out candles on a birthday cake.  Co-
      workers cheer and line up for a slice.  We MOVE AWAY from 
      them to show a LARGE PLAIN OFFICE: cubicles, paper pushing, 
      soul crushing.  And all the workers drawn to the party 
        distraction, except one--

      CANDACE BUTLER (20s).  Dark good looks and whip-smart, she 
      retains her quirks and sarcasm in a sea of gray, but it s a 
      losing battle.  She yawns and works on some documents; the 
      Meaning Of Life is not herein.  

      An INSTANT MESSAGE goes PING on Candace s computer:

                   HIGHWAY JANE 7PM tonight

      Candace perks up.  This she cares about.  She grabs her cell 
      phone and begins typing a text message--                                                                                      6.




      Linda pours coffee for Tyler.  

                                  LINDA
                    So Alex explained who we are?   The 
                    Identity Network? 

                                  TYLER
                    Not really.  He said you were a 
                     victims  rights group. 

                                  LINDA
                    We help identify John and Jane 
                    Does.   A body is found, no wallet 
                    or anything, no friends or family 
                    come forward... the police have 
                    done what they can.  

                                  TYLER
                    Okay...

                                  LINDA
                    So  The Identity Network  is made 
                    up of volunteers across the 
                    country, connected on the Internet.  
                    We share tips, ideas, we use our 
                    own knowledge and expertise... and 
                    we re all committed to finding out 
                    who these people are.

      Tyler nods.  Maybe getting it.  Linda starts walking towards                                                                                      7.



      THE LIVING ROOM

      and Tyler follows.  She turns to him:

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    So this is it.  The Midwest 
                    Regional Headquarters of  The 
                    Identity Network. 

      It s a middle class living room with a bassinet in the 
      corner.  Tyler can t hide the skepticism.  Walter looks up--

                                  WALTER
                    What, you were expecting  CSI? 

      Before Tyler can react--

                                    CANDACE
                    Just ignore him.  I m Candace.  

      She extends a hand and smiles.  Tyler shakes.  Maybe this 
      won t be so bad.

                                  LINDA
                    Tyler does facial reconstructions.
                          (to Tyler)
                    Sometimes a guy in Texas helps us 
                    out, but it s good to finally have 
                    one of our own.

                                    CANDACE
                    You complete us, Tyler.

                                  LINDA
                    He and Alex go way back.

      She gives Tyler a wry smile.  But before he can respond, 
      Walter walks over.  He s wearing his blue coverall from work.

                                  WALTER
                          (to Tyler)
                    What happened to your face?

                                  TYLER
                    Excuse me?

      Walter gives Tyler a long hard look.

                                  WALTER
                    That bruise.  On your cheek.  It 
                    tells me ten different things about 
                    you.  Maybe ten things you don t 
                    want me to know.

                                  TYLER
                    It s paint.  I m an artist.

                                  WALTER
                    Oh.                                                                                      8.



      Alex hurries into the room, carrying a file box.  And PIZZA.

                                  ALEX
                     Highway Jane.   Murdered. 
                      Interstate 88, the Westside Road 
                    exit.  Behind it there s an access 
                    road, Diehl Lane.  No ID on the 
                    body, no DNA match in the 
                      databases.
                          (takes a breath)
                    Hello everyone.

      Alex hands some photocopies to Linda as everyone assembles 
      around the dining table.  She begins passing them out as Alex 
      wheels in the CORKBOARD that was in a corner.  

      Alex tacks a GOOGLE MAP to the corkboard at one corner, and a 
      MONTHLY CALENDAR to the other.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    She was found here...
                          (circles a date)
                    And now we re here...
                          (2 weeks later)
                    And we have until here.

      Five days from now.  Tyler leans over to Candace.

                                  TYLER
                    What happens then?

                                    CANDACE
                    They bury her.  Unmarked grave in 
                    Potter s Field.  Everyone forgets 
                    about her.

                                  ALEX
                          (to Tyler)
                    And a murderer goes free.
                          (to group)
                    Here s our girl--

      He thumbtacks some CRIME SCENE PHOTOS to the board.  

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    White.  Dyed black hair.  Five foot 
                    seven.  Approximate weight 110 
                    pounds.  Approximate age 18-22.  

      Photos aren t pretty; the team reacts.  

                                  WALTER
                    Whoa.  That s a lot of decomp.

                                  ALEX
                    Which is why I ve recruited our 
                    face friend here.  Highway Jane was 
                    in the ditch at least a week.  
                    Animals probably got to her.
                    Cause of death was strangulation.                                                                                      9.



                                    CANDACE
                    That s a crime of passion.  

                                  WALTER
                    Like Jennifer Levin.  Central Park, 
                    1986.

                                  ALEX
                    Remember it s about her story.  
                    Because without who  is  it--

                                    CANDACE
                    There s no who  done  it.  We know.

      Alex smiles.  They re well trained.

                                  ALEX
                    Okay.  Here s what we ve got: black 
                    nail polish--

      Linda is up at the corkboard.  She s writing on an index 
      card: NAIL POLISH.  

                                    CANDACE
                    Goth chick?

                                  ALEX
                    Maybe.  
                          (next)
                    Clothes--

      Linda shrugs as Candace gets out her computer and powers up, 
      Linda tacks up another index card: CLOTHES.

                                  LINDA
                    Jeans and shoes look pretty 
                    regular.  But this blouse--

                                  WALTER
                    So the card should say  blouse.   
                    Alex always says to be specific.

                                  ALEX
                    I m standing right here, Walter.
                          (smiling)
                    He s right.  Chassoni.  Expensive.

                                  LINDA
                    A fancy blouse with black nails?

                                  ALEX
                    Police checked the boutiques--

                                    CANDACE
                    What about thrift stores?  She s 
                    not rich.  Rich girls have someone 
                    looking for them.                                                                                    10.



                                  ALEX
                    Good idea.  Can you get a clean 
                    photo of the blouse somewhere, 
                    something we can show around?

      Candace nods.  Linda rips up the CLOTHES card and writes 
      BLOUSE.  Alex keeps going--

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Tattoo, on her ankle--

      Alex tacks up the photo-- it looks like a bunch of SQUIGGLY 
      LINES.  Linda gives it a TATTOO card.

                                  WALTER
                          (looks at photo)
                    Of what?

                                  LINDA
                    Looks like a foreign alphabet.

                                    CANDACE
                    Maybe it s a tag.  Like a human 
                      trafficking thing.

                                  ALEX
                    We ll need some help from the 
                    Network. 

                                  LINDA
                    I ll highlight it when I set up the 
                    web page.

                                  ALEX
                    Great.  And last but not least-- 
                    this was found in her back pocket.

      Alex puts up a photocopy of a crumpled SCRAP of paper.  
      Handwritten on it:  747 - 50 

                                    CANDACE
                    It s a math problem.

                                  WALTER
                    Phone digits.

                                  LINDA
                    A flight number.

      Alex looks at it too.  Unsure.  Linda makes a card that says 
      NOTE.  Meanwhile Walter writes his own index card and puts it 
      on the corkboard.  It says ID-COC.

                                    CANDACE
                    Id-Cock?

                                  WALTER
                     ID Community Outreach 
                      Coordinator.   That is me.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    11.

                                  WALTER (CONT'D)
                    In charge of flyer production and 
                      distribution.  

      Everyone ponders this in silence.  

                                  ALEX
                    Of course.  We just didn t 
                    recognize the... evocative 
                      abbreviation.

      Then Candace realizes--

                                    CANDACE
                    Hey.  Where d Face Boy go?

      Tyler is gone.  They hear the front door CLOSE.  Alex hurries 
      out after him.


      Sparsely furnished, Tyler home, having a drink.  He types in 
      a web address: 

                       www.idnetwork.org

      He sees the homepage for  THE IDENTITY NETWORK.   It s easy 
      to navigate, but homey and not high tech.  In a word: 
      amateur.  There s a US map with different regions... listings 
      of HOT CASES... a button to REPORT A TIP... 

      Tyler goes to the Highway Jane page, which is now up: the 
        information, the headings, recapping what we know:

      HOT CASE MW-209
        UNIDENTIFIED WHITE FEMALE
      VITAL STATISTICS
      ESTIMATED HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
      CLOTHING

      and then the empty square where it says PHOTO NOT AVAILABLE.

      Tyler packs up some of his paints and works in progress, 
      clears a table, loads up a paint-splattered CD player, and 
      grabs a beer from a fridge that holds little else.

      He opens the ENVELOPE that Alex gave him: photos from the 
      morgue, close-ups, measurements.  Then he gets to work--

      -- pouring RESIN into a cast, then removing it to reveal the 
      basic shape of a CRANIUM;

      -- attaching the CRANIUM to the lower part of a separate 
      skull cast...

      Tyler consults the photos and measurements.  Then he begins 
      cutting small RUBBER PEGS into distinct lengths and numbering 
      them with a fine black pen.

      He installs two EYEBALLS into the dried skull... painting 
      them brown... shining a flashlight into each to align them... 

      We pull away, seeing Tyler s focus and skill, yet knowing 
      he ll be at this long into the night.                                                                                    14.




      Alex follows Linda back into the living room.  Tyler, 
      Candace, and Walter are standing there, in a small circle...

      They step aside, and on the dining room table we see the back 
      of a YOUNG WOMAN S head.  As Alex comes around the front, the 
      group parts slightly so Alex can see--

      The FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION of Highway Jane: black hair, brown 
      eyes, expressionless but impeccable.  And THE VOICE OF OUR 
      VICTIM RETURNS:

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    So there I was.  With a name that 
                    isn t  Jane.   With a family that s 
                    waiting.  And I don t want them 
                    waiting anymore.

      Alex gives Tyler a look of thanks.  But it s the face that 
      draws him.  And gives all of them pause, and focus.

                                  ALEX
                    This is her.  This is our girl.  
                    Her story starts here.

      Linda moves forward, puts her hand lightly on Alex s arm.

                                  LINDA
                    She s not your daughter, Alex.

      He turns to her.  He looks okay with it.  Or as okay with it 
      as someone could be.

                                  ALEX
                    I know.  But she s somebody s 
                    daughter.

                                  TYLER
                    So what do we do now?

                                  ALEX
                    We get to work.


                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    15.



                                            ACT TWO




      A closer look.  A few customers, a small shop.  No carwashes 
      or sub shops attached.  Walter drives in and parks.  


      Walter climbs over the front seat and into the back.  He 
      unzips the coverall-- and is fully clothed underneath in 
      slacks, short sleeve dress shirt, and tie.  The full 
      Sipowicz, ready for action.


      The bell CHIMES as Walter enters.  The CASHIER (20s) looks up 
      briefly: dark hair, ponytail, not friendly.

                                  WALTER
                    Hey there.  Cold out.  Chilly.

      Cashier nods but doesn t say anything.  Walter pretends to 
      look at items on the counter, fingering a keychain.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Business pretty slow, huh?

                                    CASHIER
                    The porn s over there.

                                  WALTER
                    No, no-- I was wondering if I could 
                    ask you something.  I don t know if 
                    you re aware of this, but there was 
                    a murder a couple of weeks ago, 
                    over there across the road.  

      Walter gestures out the window, towards the highway and woods 
      in the near distance, a slight ditch alongside the access 
      road where the body was dumped.                                                                                     17.



                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    And I was hoping we could leave 
                    some flyers here, for the 
                      customers.

      He puts a stack on the counter.  We catch a glimpse: they say 
      DO YOU KNOW HER? and there s pictures of the facial 
        reconstruction, the tattoo, the note.  Cashier pushes them 
      away.

                                    CASHIER
                    No.  That s against store policy.  

      Walter seems surprised.  But he s ready with a comeback.

                                  WALTER
                    Really?  Well your policy is 
                    against my policy.

                                    CASHIER
                    Get them out of here.

      Cashier seems pretty serious.  Walter nods, picks them up, 
      but he isn t done yet.

                                  WALTER
                    This is the closest gas station 
                    around.  It s the only gas station 
                    around.  You were here that night, 
                    right?  By yourself?

                                    CASHIER
                    So what?

                                  WALTER
                    So maybe you saw something.  Or 
                    maybe... you did something.

                                    CASHIER
                    I already talked to the police.  
                    And unless you ve got some kind of 
                    badge, we re done talking.

      Walter s done.  He s leaving.  But as he s walking out he 
      quickly turns back-- and SNAPS a PHOTO.

                                  WALTER
                    I m watching you.

                                    CASHIER
                    Rock on, Shaggy.

      Walter exits.  Cashier returns to a magazine.


      We follow Candace through the store at a high angle as she 
      ends up browsing at the cosmetic counter.  The place is luxe 
      and the CLERKS look down at her if they look at all.  And THE 
      VOICE OF OUR VICTIM returns: 

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    I was always a ruby and peach kind 
                    of girl.  Bright red, soft pink.  
                    Nothing in between.

      Candace realizes what she s looking for isn t here.  She 
      exits.


      Like that HOT TOPIC store: black velvet posters, goofy gifts, 
      jailbait fashion.  Candace shows the flyer to the SALES 
      CLERK, but she doesn t recognize the picture.  

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    But that was the old me.  The new 
                    me wanted it dark and different. 

      Candace buys several different black nail polishes.  

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    It s amazing how just a little 
                    thing -- the color of your nails -- 
                    can change not just how you see the 
                    world... but how you see yourself.

      As Candace waits to pay for them, she notices several 
      different HANDOUTS next to the register.  Advertisements for 
      CLUBS, CONCERTS, etc.  One in particular has striking, snazzy 
      graphics:  SILVERTONGUE.   She grabs all of them and we:

                                                                            CUT TO:

       DOE MOMENT 

      and this time we get a tight close-up of Highway Jane s 
      nails, and then her hands... perhaps a hint of her forearm... 
      tantalizing glimpses of a moment she lived... slow motion, 
      sound muted... a dream we can t fully remember...

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    So all I can say is-- paint it 
                    black, baby.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    19.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I didn t do it to match my mood.  I 
                    did it to give me one.

      And she paints her nails, blows them dry, assesses them in 
      the light... holding them up to a face we still can t see...

                                                                              RESUME:


      Candace back at her cubicle.  She has just finished painting 
      her nails black.  She looks at them, kind of digging it--

      Co-workers MONICA and MEL (20s) watch from another cubicle.

                                  MONICA
                    What a freak.

      Candace has had enough.  She stands up and smiles sweetly.

                                    CANDACE
                    Hey Monica, Melanie.  It s so 
                    totally weird.  There s like, ten 
                    different kinds of black nail 
                    polish.  Did you know that?

      They re a little put off, office cowards smiling awkwardly.  
      Candace shows them all ten fingers.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    Anyway, I m not sure which I like 
                    best... but I m leaning towards 
                    these two.

      She curls up her hands-- only middle fingers now extended.   
      Monica and Mel are shocked, faces filled with OMG.  Candace 
      sits back down, loving it.  Maybe the nails have done 
      something to her mood, too.


      CLOSE on some new cards: USHER/AUGUSTA, PSYCHIC/DETROIT... 
      Candace writes the second one and pins it to the board.  
      Everyone present.  Empty pizza boxes, coffee cups... Walter 
      peers at Linda s computer screen.

                                  WALTER
                    Ten new  forwards  already? 

      Tyler looks at Candace, confused.

                                    CANDACE
                    It s a person who comes  forward  
                    with a tip.

                                  TYLER
                    Ah.

      Tyler sits down on the couch and it SQUEAKS.  He looks 
      underneath: he sat on a baby toy.                                                                                    20.



                                  LINDA
                    Actually 12 now.  The flyers and 
                    the email blast really helped.

      Tyler tosses the toy to Linda, who is printing pages, hands 
      them to Candace, who reads the pages and shakes her head but 
      makes a new card anyway-- DRAG QUEEN/HOUSTON. 

                                    CANDACE
                    Some better than others.

      It joins the rest under a new heading on the corkboard: 
       FORWARDS.   Meanwhile Alex is attaching a business card and 
      photos from the thrift shop to the corkboard under BLOUSE.  
      The first of many fragments of her life, a collage that has 
      begun to come together.

                                  ALEX
                    The blouse was purchased at 
                    Sunshine Thrift, on Ashland Avenue.  
                    Record of the sale but no record of 
                    the buyer.

                                    CANDACE
                    West Loop, right?  The University s 
                    near there.  Was she a student?

                                  LINDA
                    I don t think any of the local 
                    colleges reported anyone missing.  
                    But I ll double check that.

      Another heading now says MISSING CROSS-CHECK and has a list 
      of states and a STATE MAP.  Linda has several windows open on 
      her computer monitor and a couple of three-ring binders open 
      on her desk-- all featuring FACES OF YOUNG WOMEN. 

                                    CANDACE
                          (to Alex)
                    Anything on the tattoo from 
                    Detective Olivo?

                                  ALEX
                    She says there s nothing from the 
                    federal or international databases, 
                    so it s nothing with organized 
                    crime or trafficking.  

                                  LINDA
                    I got an email from a new member, 
                    this professor of Near Eastern 
                    studies at UCLA.  He thinks it s 
                    the Arabic word for  thunder. 

                                  ALEX
                       Thunder?   That s an interesting 
                    choice for a teenage girl.

                                  WALTER
                    Maybe she was dating an Arab guy.  
                    Part of a sleeper cell.                                                                                    21.



                                  TYLER
                    Or studying to be a meteorologist.

      Alex smiles, appreciating Tyler s humor-- but he is also 
      looking at a photo on the cork board-- the gas station 
      attendant.

                                  ALEX
                    Who s that guy?

                                  WALTER
                    The gas station clerk.  I m 
                    watching him.

      Alex considers this and is tempted to comment... then just 
      shrugs and accepts it.

                                    CANDACE
                      I couldn t really narrow down the 
                    nail polish--

                                  TYLER
                    There s more than one black?

                                    CANDACE
                      Apparently.  But I did pick up 
                    these.

      She shows them the flyers from the mall store.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    If she gets her nail polish there, 
                    maybe she gets her social life 
                    there, too.

                                  ALEX
                    Good.  We ve got less than four 
                    days, people.  Remember-- she s 
                    still Highway Jane because it isn t 
                    obvious.  If this were easy she d 
                    be home already.
                          (to Candace and Tyler)
                    You guys want to handle it?  You 
                    look like the nightclubbing types.

                                  TYLER
                    I went to Catholic school.

                                    CANDACE
                    We ll go.

                                  ALEX
                    Great.  Check in later.  And be 
                    careful.  Her story s out there but 
                    so is the person who ended it.

      They nod and get up to head out.  Meanwhile Walter is also 
      putting on his coat.                                                                                    22.



                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Uh Walter?  Most social 
                      establishments have a  no jumpsuit  
                    policy.

                                  WALTER
                    I m not going with them.  I have to 
                    go to work.  

                                  ALEX
                    Oh.  Okay.

      Walter gets defensive (for no reason).

                                  WALTER
                    I m sorry, all right?  But they 
                    don t let people at the phone 
                    company take their pension at 40.

      Linda looks at the clock.

                                  LINDA
                    I thought you were supposed to be 
                    there two hours ago.

                                  WALTER
                          (irritated)
                    We can only provide a window, 
                    Linda.

      Walter leaves.  Alex and Linda exchange a look.


      Dark and crowded, we hear more than we see: a METAL BAND 
      plays on stage, the music is LOUD and AGGRESSIVE, bodies 
      mashed together, corners and shadows where we don t want to 
      linger...  

      Candace and Tyler climb to a BALCONY, jostling as they go.  
      Tyler looks particularly unimpressed with the crowd.

                                    CANDACE
                    This one s even more crowded.  Who 
                    are these people?

                                  TYLER
                    Please tell me we re out of flyers.

      They reach the balcony where there s another BAR crammed with 
      people, they look down at the crowd and take it in as we:

                                                                          FLASH TO:                                                                                    23.



       DOE MOMENT 

      As in the crowd we see a snippet of Highway Jane dancing... 
        slow-motion, almost dreamlike... another one of her 
      footprints in the world...

                                                                              RESUME:


      Candace takes a picture of the downstairs with her phone.  
      Then she pulls a stack of flyers from her bag, handing a 
      bunch to Tyler and starting to work the crowd:

                                    CANDACE
                    Hey do you know this girl?  No?

      But Tyler s still at the railing-- and ONE GUY is looking 
      right back up at him... he s got a SHAVED HEAD, skull tattoo, 
      flesh tunnels on both ears-- but his cold eyes are the most 
      frightening thing of all.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    Tyler!

      Candace grabs his arm and he turns suddenly-- but she s not 
      in any danger, she just wants him to get to work.  Tyler 
      nods, taking some of the flyers-- when he turns back to look 
      down below for Shaved Head, he s gone.

      Tyler s puzzled, but Candace has already pushed him forward 
      into the crowd at the bar as she s handed a flyer to a YOUNG 
      DRUNK GUY:

                                  YOUNG DRUNK GUY
                    That s awesome!  You re really 
                    talented!

      People pushing, it s difficult to hear (or be heard) over the 
      music-- behind them they don t notice as Shaved Head has 
      climbed the stairs and spotted them--

                                  TYLER
                    Have you seen her before?

                                  YOUNG DRUNK GUY
                    Her eyes are haunting, man!  It s 
                    like the despair of a generation!

                                    CANDACE
                          (yelling)
                    Do you know her?!?!

      He nods and shakes his head and smiles, bobbing, huh?  
      Candace and Tyler look at each other-- and then Shaved Head 
      grabs Tyler roughly from behind--

                                  TYLER
                    Hey--                                                                                    24.



                                  SHAVED HEAD
                    You cops?

                                    CANDACE
                    No.  We re just looking for anyone 
                    who knows this girl--

      She holds up a flyer, and he grabs it and crumples it.

                                  SHAVED HEAD
                    You don t belong here.  Get out.

      Tyler puts his hands up in surrender, but Shaved Head is 
      still herding them towards the stairs.  

      Busy with Tyler, he doesn t notice as Candace leans behind 
      and stashes a bunch of flyers on the edge of the bar... 


      Alex and Linda are comparing a MISSING PERSON PHOTO to the 
      sculpture of the head, which is on the coffee table.

                                  ALEX
                    Nope.

                                  LINDA
                    That s the last one.

      Alex gets up and wanders into the kitchen.  Meanwhile Linda 
      goes to the corkboard and crosses off OHIO and colors it in 
      on a US map, then moves up a card that says IOWA...  

      Alex walks back in.  He s chugging something into his mouth.  
      Linda reacts, replacing one binder off the shelf and grabbing 
      another.

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Please tell me that s not baby 
                    food.

                                  ALEX
                    It tastes like chicken.

                                  LINDA
                    It is chicken.

      He looks at the jar.

                                  ALEX
                    Cool.  

      Suddenly there s a CRACK CRACK CRACK noise out front.  Alex 
      turns to Linda as they both look up.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    What was that?

      Alex heads out--                                                                                    25.




      Alex storms back in.  

                                  ALEX
                    If I were still a cop--

                                  LINDA
                    Don t.

      Linda is unperturbed, she has gone back to the binders, 
      sorting out the relevant pages...

                                  ALEX
                    Screw it.  I m calling it in.

      She turns to him, much more insistent.

                                  LINDA
                    Don t.

                                  ALEX
                    You can t live like this.  You re 
                    husband is the criminal.  He s the 
                    murderer.

                                  LINDA
                    And to them I m the one who didn t 
                    do anything to stop him.

      She points outside: the street, the world.

                                  ALEX
                    What could you have done?  You 
                    didn t know anything about it, 
                    Linda.  You didn t do anything 
                    wrong!

                                  LINDA
                          (re corkboard)
                    She needs us.  We re wasting time.

      She s tough.  And as determined for her own reasons.                                                                                     26.

                    I should stay--

                                  LINDA
                    No.  Go home and get some rest.

      She smiles at him faintly.  

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

      It s friendship, and support, but there s limits to it all.  
      Alex nods.  Grabs his coat.


      Still going strong, upstairs at the bar those flyers Candace 
      left have spilled onto the floor.

      But a few are left on the counter, and a girl named JESSICA 
      leans over and a wet one sticks to her arm, she laughs as she 
      talks with her FRIENDS and peels it off... but then she sees 
      the picture on it and her face changes...

      She makes sure no one s looking... then folds it up and puts 
      it in her pocket.


      Olivo at her desk, jotting it down.

                                  DET OLIVO
                          (into phone)
                    Okay.  I ll take a look.

                                                                              RESUME:


      Linda walks in from the back door, Alex behind.

                                  ALEX
                    You okay?

      She nods.  Candace is at the corkboard, adding photos from 
      the club-- plus photos of the bouncer and Jessica.  Walter 
      looks up at it.

                                  WALTER
                    So crime of passion.  It all makes 
                    sense.  You ve got the boyfriend--

                                    CANDACE
                    I don t know that I d call him 
                       boyfriend.   According to Jessica 
                    it may have been more like  creep 
                    with benefits. 

      Alex joins her, adding: another map, a card that says VIVIAN 
      and then has a blank line after it for the last name.  The 
      board has really filled up.

                                  ALEX
                    Whatever.  Olivo s running his 
                    priors.  Maybe we ll get a hit.

      Tyler pours coffee for Candace.  Alex looks up at the 
      corkboard: that TATTOO card and accompanying photo are alone 
      and forlorn; so is the NOTE from her pocket.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Tattoo and note are looking pretty 
                    lonely.

                                  WALTER
                    Note s gonna take a miracle.

                                  TYLER
                    I thought the tat was Arabic for 
                    thunder.

                                  LINDA
                          (shakes head)
                    I posted the UCLA guy s tip.  Four 
                    other people emailed today to say 
                    the loop is wrong.  Or something.                                                                                    33.



                                  ALEX
                    So she s not a meteorologist.

      Linda finishes printing out a COLORED MAP.  Hands it to Alex--
      he attaches it to the corkboard.  It s a COLORED RAIL MAP for 
      the CTA - Chicago Transit Authority.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    There s two CTA lines off Kedzie, 
                    near the club.  Green is north.  
                    Blue is south.

                                  LINDA
                    And Jessica said--

                                  ALEX
                    Our girl walked South.  To the blue 
                    line.  Which means--

      He points to the map.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Highway Jane had a wild side but 
                    she wasn t stupid.  When you can 
                    walk to either train, you choose 
                    the one that takes you straight 
                    home, right?   

      He points to a broad area slightly north of downtown.

                                  TYLER
                    West Loop.  Near the thrift store 
                    where she bought the blouse.

                                  ALEX
                    Yup.  Which means our girl slept 
                    there.  She woke up there.  She 
                    bought... cereal there.

                                  LINDA
                    And maybe she worked around there--

                                  ALEX
                    Yes!  You don t just wander through 
                    the world without leaving tracks!  
                    She was here!  We ve only got three 
                    days but we re close!  Let s find 
                    her!

      Alex SMACKS the corkboard map of her neighborhood.  He s 
      fired up.  And that gets them fired up.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    We re gonna expand the radius.  Use 
                    the Division El stop at the center 
                    and go from there.  Walter--

                                  WALTER
                    I m on my way.                                                                                    34.



      Walter heads out.  


      Homey but worn (sort of like Walter).  He unlocks the door 
      and enters, moving with a purpose.  

      But then he stops and takes it in: his son WALTER JUNIOR (10) 
      playing a violent video game in the living room.  Nut cutting 
      wife ARIANNA (40s) cooking something nasty in the kitchen.   
      This is his life. He walks past them both into a

      SUNPORCH

      which has been modified and transformed into Walter s 
       MYSTERY STUDY.   

      Walls overflowing with books and binders, hundreds of mystery 
      novels, crime encyclopedias, DVD box sets.  A signed headshot 
      of PATRICIA CORNWELL; a photo of Walter and DENNIS FRANZ on 
      some golf course (possibly photoshopped).  

      This is his haven; these people -- real or otherwise -- his 
        inspiration.  As Arianna finally looks up he closes the 
      sliding door and that world disappears.  

                                  WALTER
                    Expand the radius... find her 
                    haunts...

      He calls up GOOGLE EARTH and types in the address of the 
      thrift store and the DIVISION El stop.  It shows up visually 
      and then he works outward from there, the train station 
      visible as the epicenter.  There s names/addresses of the 
      nearest drug stores, gyms, dry cleaners... 


      There s a new heading on the corkboard: HAUNTS.  Linda is 
      printing them out as Walter sends them, adding lists and maps 
      and check-off boxes... 

                                  LINDA
                    Come on... someone send her home...

      She finishes an email, sends it on to Candace--


      Tyler chats with the FRONT DESK CLERK, showing him the new 
      flyer, the clerk shaking his head.  Tyler CHECKS OFF another 
      business on his own HAUNTS phone file.  It s all coordinated.


      Candace chats with a group of CASHIERS, showing them the 
      flyer.

                                    CANDACE
                    Any of you guys remember her?  

      No response.  Candace shows them a bottle of black nail 
      polish, trying to make friends.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    She might have bought this.  You 
                    don t sell a lot of it, do you?  
                    You probably thought to yourself, 
                     wow that stuff s really ugly, but 
                      whatever. 

      Still nothing from the clerks.  Candace a bit frustrated.  
      Then one in the back pipes up:

                                  CLERK
                    Oh yeah.  I seen her.  She was in 
                    here like a month ago.  She was in 
                    here a bunch of times.
                          (to other clerks)
                    Remember?  Paid with all those 
                    coins and ones?

                                    CANDACE
                    Small bills?

      Candace nods and thinks about this... looking out the window 
      at a CAFE across the street...


        A sandwich/coffee shop in the neighborhood.  Alex and Candace 
      are there with the MANAGER.  Good-looking, mid 20s.  She s 
      given him a flyer.  

                                    CANDACE
                    They said she paid with coins and 
                    small bills.  So I figured she was 
                    using tip money--

      She points across the street where the DRUGSTORE is.  Alex 
      smiles at her-- impressed.  They turn to the manager.

                                  ALEX
                    So?

                                    MANAGER
                    It s her.  She quit three weeks 
                    ago.  Something happened.  Someone 
                    came in, she got really upset.

                                  ALEX
                    A guy?

                                    MANAGER
                    No.  A woman.  

                                    CANDACE
                    This woman?

      She holds up a photo of Jessica.

                                    MANAGER
                    No.  Older.  Maybe 40.  Brown curly 
                    hair.  With her husband and a 
                    little boy.

      Alex nods.  It gets even more complicated.  And now he waits 
      for the rest...

                                    MANAGER (CONT D)
                    Simmons.  Her name is Vivian 
                    Simmons.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Detective Olivo walks through the busy office. 

                                  DET OLIVO
                          (on phone)
                       Simmons?   Alex are you sure?

      She stops, grabs a pen from a COLLEAGUE, jots it down.                                                                                    37.




      Alex on the phone--

                                  ALEX
                          (on phone)
                    I m sure.  The manager gave her 
                    address, it s six blocks away on 
                      Hennessey.  We re gonna go knock on 
                    the door, maybe there s a roommate.  
                    Get started on the permanent 
                    address.

      He hangs up.  The manager going through some folders, finds 
      the right one and hands it to Alex--


      Olivo standing there with a dead phone.  A little put off.

                                  DET OLIVO
                          (to herself)
                    Yes sir...

      Behind her, another COP is bringing in Quint (the bouncer) 
      for questioning.  Not pleased.  The Cop looks to Olivo, who 
      gestures where she wants him.


      The elevator opens-- Alex emerges, Tyler in tow.  The 
      building is modest, not fancy.  Alex knocks on the door.  No 
      answer at the door.

                                  ALEX
                    Let s try the neighbors.

      They knock on another door.  One side, then the other-- a 
      DOOR finally opens and a YOUNG GUY leans out.  Glasses, 
      khakis, clean cut and normal.  His name is CLAY.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Hey.  Did you know the girl who 
                    lived here?

      He points to Vivian s door.

                                  CLAY
                    Vivian?  Sure.

                                  ALEX
                    She lived by herself?

                                  CLAY
                    I think so.  Pretty sure, yeah.  I 
                    haven t seen her in a while.  I 
                    thought she d moved somewhere else.

                                  ALEX
                    Any idea where?                                                                                    38.



                                  CLAY
                    No.

                                  ALEX
                    You were friends?

                                  CLAY
                    I guess.  I mean, we were.
                          (laughs)
                    Strange girl.

                                  ALEX
                    What do you mean?

                                  CLAY
                    She moved in, like, a year ago?  
                    I d see her once in a while, here 
                    or at Cafe Helene when I was 
                    studying.  We d say hello, no big 
                    deal.  And then about six months 
                    ago...

      He stops, not sure how to describe it.

                                  TYLER
                    Six months ago?  What happened?

                                  CLAY
                    Her hair.  Her clothes.  Everything 
                    changed.  It all went... dark.

                                  ALEX
                    So she wasn t always like that?

                                  CLAY
                    Not at all.  It was like the sun 
                    went down.  I saw her in the mail 
                    room-- whoa.  I didn t even 
                    recognize her.  Overnight she was 
                    somebody else.

                                  TYLER
                    Any idea why?

                                  ALEX
                    Any guys hang around?  Maybe a big 
                    guy, shaved head?

      Clay shakes his head, stumped.  Before Alex can press him, 
      his phone RINGS.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Excuse me.
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah?

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    39.




      Alex hangs up.  Turns back to Clay.

                                  ALEX
                    We have to go.  What s your name? 

                                  CLAY
                    Clay.  Is Vivian all right?  

                                  ALEX
                    Not exactly.  Thanks for your time, 
                    Clay.

      They hurry towards the elevator.  Clay watches them go, 
      shrugs, and heads back into his apartment.


      Status meeting.  The corkboard is almost full, but it feels 
      like a fraud.  They seem blindsided by what has happened.

                                  ALEX
                    So the real Vivian Simmons had her 
                    purse stolen at the Art Institute 
                    almost three years ago.

                                  LINDA
                    Highway Jane must have done it.  
                    She took her identity.  

      Walter attaches a photo of the  real  Vivian to the 
      corkboard, taken from the front of her Evanston house.

                                    CANDACE
                    Highway Jane became this girl.  She 
                    didn t want to be found.

                                  TYLER
                    I know the feeling.

                                  ALEX
                    So where are we?

                                  WALTER
                    Back to calling her  Highway Jane  
                    for one thing.

      Walter pulls down some credit card receipts, then crosses out 
      Vivian s name on the card, then grabs and crumples it. 

                                  ALEX
                    No.

      Alex smooths out the VIVIAN card and puts it back on the 
      board; it s a record of everything, the hits and the misses.  

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    The things she did, the places she 
                    went... we still have that.  We 
                    don t have the name but we ve still 
                    got two days and it s still her.  
                    This is still her.

      Alex gestures towards the corkboard.  They seem willing to 
      concede it.  As they study it--

                                  TYLER
                    What about the bouncer?

      On Alex:                                                                                    42.




      Bulletproof glass, wrong side of town.  Bouncer Quint 
      finishes paying for a pack of cigarettes and a newspaper and 
      exits.


      Candace, Tyler, Alex at a booth.  They ve got some of the 
      files spread on the table in front of them.  

                                  ALEX
                    Why just become someone else?   You 
                    move here, you re 17 or 18--

                                    CANDACE
                    Maybe she didn t know who she was.  
                    Maybe she was still trying to 
                    figure it out.                                                                                     44.



      Meanwhile Tyler is sort of half listening... he s found the 
      photo of the tattoo, half-buried under some other stuff.  
      Alex is still pondering.

                                  ALEX
                    No.  Something big must have 
                    happened.  Her world changed.  This 
                    was her way of fighting back.

      Walter arrives and slides into the booth.  He s got a rising 
      bruise on his cheek.  He s nonchalant, going with the Badge 
      of Honor approach.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    What happened?

                                  WALTER
                    Hey.  It s okay.  This is what we 
                    do.

                                  TYLER
                    Get hit in the face?

                                    CANDACE
                    He s been seriously id-cocked.

      The Manager approaches, surprised to see all of them.

                                    MANAGER
                    You re here.

                                  ALEX
                    Because she was here.  

      Manager doesn t get it.  Meanwhile Tyler has figured 
      something out.  He takes the edge of the sheet, slides it 
      DIRECTLY up to the edge of the tattoo, and begins sketching.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                          (to Tyler)
                    Hello?

                                  TYLER
                    It s not a word.  It s part of an 
                    animal.  

      As Alex, Candace, and the Manager move closer to look: the 
      outline of the bottom half of an ANIMAL is clearly visible... 
      and Tyler has added a rough sketch of the other half...

                                                                            CUT TO:

       DOE MOMENT 

      There s a glimpse of her hair and her cheek, maybe the corner 
      of a smile or laugh... 

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    I can make fun of it now, but at 
                    the time?  When you re 17?

                    Making that choice?  Feeling that 
                    pain?  Doing something permanent?

      And now that we know so much more, we don t just watch her 
      wander in a club or down a street-- we stay with her.  
      Friends in the room, context of life.  She gets that tattoo.  

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    It s like the most important thing 
                    that has ever happened in your 
                    entire life.

                                                                              RESUME:


      The Manager studies it.  Stunned.

                                    MANAGER
                    I know that picture.

                                  ALEX
                    You do?

                                    MANAGER
                    The woman who came in, the one who 
                    got Vivian so upset-- remember how 
                    I said she had a little boy with 
                    her?  It was on his sweatshirt.  
                    With a big C around it, like this--

      He takes a pen and draws a large C around the animal.  They 
      look at each other--

                                  TYLER
                    It s a mascot.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Linda at her computer, Tyler, Walter, Alex at the dining room 
      table, pouring through CLIP ART books, GRAPHIC CATALOGS--

                                    CANDACE
                    Here.  School ring catalogs.

                                  TYLER
                    Why only part of a tattoo?  She run 
                    out of money?

                                  ALEX
                    Maybe her parents.  

      He throws more books onto the table.  They keep searching...

                                  WALTER
                    She was pretty.  I bet she was a 
                      cheerleader.                                                                                     46.



                                    CANDACE
                    That s sexist.

                                  TYLER
                    Girls on the math team don t get 
                    tattoos on their ankles.

                                    CANDACE
                    How would you know?
                          (thinks)
                    Don t answer that.

                                  LINDA
                    Got it.

      They hurry over to her computer, where the tattoo fragment is 
      side by side with the image from a high school.

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    It s a tiger.  A Bengal tiger, to 
                    be specific.  The ear is different 
                    and the stripes are slightly wider.

      Candace has her own computer out, she types something in--

                                    CANDACE
                    There s 15 high schools with Bengal 
                    mascots in Illinois and Iowa--

                                  LINDA
                    But only one starts with a C.

      Linda has called up a HIGH SCHOOL HOME PAGE.  An exact match.

                                          ACT FIVE




      A hundred students, hastily assembled.  Some of the TEACHERS 
      as well, supervising and shushing.  Alex and Olivo on stage.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    I m Detective Grace Olivo from 
                    Chicago.  And I d like to introduce 
                    Alex Donovan, who works with a 
                    group called The Identity Network.

      No applause or anything, but they are basically paying 
      attention.  Alex takes the microphone from Olivo.

                                  ALEX
                    Thanks.  
                          (to kids)
                    Hello.                                                                                     48.



      He seems pretty comfortable on stage.  Meanwhile Candace has 
      brought up a cardboard box and places it on a table.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    So-- there s a girl who went to 
                    school here, three years ago.  We 
                    don t know her name.  We don t know 
                    exactly how old she is, so we re 
                    not exactly sure if she was a 
                    junior then, or a senior and she 
                    was graduating...

      Students fidget: what does this have to do with us?

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    I know.  It sounds crazy.  But she 
                    ran away to Chicago, someone killed 
                    her there.  She was strangled, she 
                    was left by the side of the road. 

      Now he has their attention.  For better or worse.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Now we know where she s from.  We 
                    know she s one of you.  And we re 
                    hoping one of you can tell us 
                    exactly who she is.

      Alex opens the box and pulls out the facial reconstruction.  
      The students MURMUR -- one part nervous laughter, two parts 
      morbid fascination -- and Candace presses a button on her 
      laptop and the image goes up on two large MONITORS so all the 
      students can see... 

                                  DET OLIVO
                    If anyone has any information--

      Suddenly a FEMALE STUDENT bolts from her seat, running back 
      out of the auditorium--

                                  ALEX
                    Excuse me?  Hey!

      She doesn t stop.  She s out the door, Alex and Candace look 
      at each other and then head for a side exit--


      Alex and Candace into the hallway-- the girl visible at the 
      other end--

                                    CANDACE
                    Hey!  Stop!

      She doesn t.  She s out the door--                                                                                    49.




      The house is clean, quiet, a sense of absence.  Alex and 
      Olivo sit across from Sally.

                                  SALLY
                    She was a great girl.  Honor

                                  ALEX
                    Her father?

                                  SALLY
                    They were very close.  She and I 
                    got along, but Tracy was Daddy s 
                    little girl.  He d been sick.  
                    Cancer.  But we didn t know how to 
                    tell her.  She was so busy with 
                    school, and activities... before we 
                    figured it out, he had a seizure on 
                    his way to work.  Car accident, he 
                    ran off the road.  Killed 
                      instantly. 

                                  DET OLIVO
                    I m sorry.

                                  SALLY
                    She was cutting class, getting a 
                    tattoo with a couple of her 
                    friends.  It wasn t a big deal.  
                    Until I had to pull her out and 
                    tell her that her father was dead.
                    She ended up with this half 
                    finished tiger on her ankle.  She 
                    wore it like a badge of honor.  

      Sally remembers the moment with a faint smile.

                                  ALEX
                    But she was angry.

                                  SALLY
                    She blamed me.  She stopped 
                    speaking to me and her sister.  
                    Tracy and I had argued about things 
                    before, but Trevor was always there 
                    to work it out between us.  This 
                    time there was no one.  And a few 
                    weeks later she was just gone.  

      Candace comes downstairs.                                                                                    51.

                    Amy s resting.

                                  SALLY
                    Thank you.
                          (to Olivo)
                    I filed a missing persons report 
                    three years ago with the Iowa State 
                    Police.  Wouldn t that have somehow 
                    gotten to Chicago?  

                                  DET OLIVO
                    It may have, but with missing 
                    persons, the databases... they 
                    aren t always linked between 
                    different cities or states.

                                  SALLY
                    Oh.

                                  ALEX
                    And some of the details were 
                      complicated.

      We PAN over to some FAMILY PHOTOS, including a SCHOOL 
      PORTRAIT-- and Tracy was BLONDE.  Alex notes this.  


      The team all looking up at the board.

                                  ALEX
                     Loose ends.   What did Tracy mean?

                                  WALTER
                    Well she quit her job.

                                  LINDA
                    No.  It has to be more than that.

                                    CANDACE
                    Tracy became Goth Girl in Chicago.  
                    But if she was going home, maybe 
                    she needed time to change back.

                                  TYLER
                    Yeah.  She bought the nice blouse.

                                  ALEX
                    She did.  But a loose end isn t a 
                    piece of clothing.  It s a person.                                                                                    54.



      Alex takes the whole board in.  And we follow all we ve 
      learned as he narrates--

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Her father dies, she gets half a 
                    tattoo, she has a falling out with 
                    her family and runs away to 
                    Chicago.  She has no idea who she 
                    is.  No idea who she wants to be.  
                    That one anchor in her life-- gone.

      Alex is looking at the picture of Vivian, the card that says 
      PURSE STOLEN FEB 07.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    She goes to the Art Institute one 
                    day.  A young woman s there, with a 
                    different look, a purse left on a 
                    bench... she steals it.  The name, 
                    the look, a face for the world.  
                    I ll be her.  I ll get a job-- 

      He moves on-- but then stops.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Wait a second.
                          (to Tyler)
                    Clay.  The guy in the apartment 
                    building.  He said they were cool, 
                    right?

                                  TYLER
                    Yeah...

                                  ALEX
                    But he said six months ago she 
                    changed.  Dyed hair, the nails--

                                  TYLER
                    Right.  So?

      Alex turns to everyone.  Using the board to illustrate:

                                  ALEX
                    But Vivian had her purse stolen two 
                    years before that.  Tracy became 
                    Vivian-- she became Goth Girl then.  

                                  LINDA
                    So why did Clay tell us it happened 
                    six months ago?

                                  WALTER
                    Because he s lying.

      Alex is already out the door--


                                      END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    55.



                                            ACT SIX




      Olivo knocks on Clay s door.  Alex stands behind.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Mr. Manning?  Chicago Police.

      No answer.  She knocks again-- CRASH!  Something s going on, 
      they look at each other, Olivo doesn t hesitate, she draws 
      her gun and kicks in the door and they are inside-- 


      A quick look around, starving student chic: hot plate, futon, 
      desk overflowing with books--

                                  ALEX
                    There!

      They look towards the window, it s open, CLATTERING on the 
      fire escape, Alex leans out and sees him nearing the ground--

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Freeze!  Police!

      But Clay doesn t stop, and when Alex feels for a gun of 
      course he doesn t have one--

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                          (to Olivo)
                    Call it in--

      As she takes a step back and gets on her phone Alex climbs 
      out onto the                                                                                    56.



      FIRE ESCAPE

      and hurries down after him, Clay jumps the last ten feet to 
      the ground and takes off running, Alex halfway down now--


      Olivo and another DETECTIVE interrogate Clay.  He sits with 
      arms folded.  Alex watches from another room.

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    But even though the apartment was 
                    clean, denial only gets you so 
                    far...


      Two DETECTIVES coming out of the building carrying boxes of 
      evidence, including a worn SMALL BLACK SUITCASE:

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    When they found my bag in his 
                    campus locker...


      They re going through his car.  A LAB TECH holds up a sliver 
      on a pair of tweezers... it looks black in the light...

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    ...and fragments of my nail polish 
                    on his clothes and in the passenger 
                    seat of his car...


      All of this has been presented to Clay.  

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    And now they re gonna fry the 
                    bastard.

      They ve got him... and he s smart enough to know it.  He 
      breaks down crying.  And as starts to talk, Tracy tells us 
      their story:

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    We met at Cafe Helene.  I was 
                    working.  He was studying.  Day 
                    after day... a smile becomes a 
                    word, a word becomes a 
                      conversation... he flattered me.  
                    He adored me.  He said he d never 
                    met anyone like me.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    58.

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And what did I see in him?  He was 
                    smart.  Caring.  Most Likely To 
                    Succeed.

      Olivo listens, unmoved.  She slides a sheet of paper and a 
      pen across to him.  

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I saw myself.

      And as Clay begins to write we:

                                                                            CUT TO:

       DOE MOMENT 

      our final one, where dreamy snippets become fleshed out 
      reality and we ll see the whole picture for the first time... 

      And we re back at the GAS STATION as Tracy sits in the 
      passenger seat, drumming her fingernails...

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                      Eventually I realized it.  I told 
                    him how I d seen an old friend and 
                    now I knew it was time for Vivian 
                    to say goodbye.  Not just to him, 
                    but to everyone.  He said he 
                      understood and I believed him.  I 
                    wanted to believe him.  

      And we pull back and see Tracy s face IN FULL for the first 
      time... so beautiful, as we d guessed...  And she smiles, as   
      Clay returns to the car...  

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But he lied.  Nothing I said 
                    mattered.  He wasn t taking me 
                    home.  We were together six 
                    months... but he knew from the 
                    beginning he would never let me go.

      They pull out of the gas station...

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    He took my life.  He took my name.

      And as they head to the access road she looks out the window, 
      not noticing that Clay is looking at her with longing and 
      lust and simmering rage that fuel the crime he is about to 
      commit...

                                                                              RESUME:


      As Clay is cuffed and led away.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    59.
