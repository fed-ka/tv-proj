      Noah washes his mouth out with toothpaste and scrubs his 
      hands vigorously in the sink. He breathes into them and 
      sniffs.

      An old-fashioned ALARM CLOCK goes berserk in the adjacent 
      bedroom. Noah s wife, HALLA, 40, reaches one hand out from 
      under a pile of covers and attempts to blindly silence it. 
      Her hand flails, landing to the left and right of the clock, 
      missing it every time.

      Noah laughs.



      Sitting on the edge of the bed, Noah turns off the alarm 
      clock and pulls back the covers. Halla opens one eye and 
      looks up at him, groggy.

                                  HALLA
                    Hi friend.

                                  NOAH
                    Hi friend.

      Noah leans over and kisses her forehead. Her cheek. Her neck.                                                                                      2.


                                  HALLA
                    You smell good.

      She reaches up for him and he climbs on top of her. More 
      sleepy kissing. As his hands move down her body -

      The BABY MONITOR on the other side of their bed crackles 
      alive and then admits a CRY.

      Noah groans and rolls off of Halla.

                                  NOAH
                    I ll get it.

                                  HALLA
                    No, I ll get it. You load the car.

      Halla slips out of bed, wearing his tee-shirt. He watches her 
      go.

                                  NOAH
                    Nice bum.

      Halla slaps her ass in response. Noah grins. 



      Noah sits in front of a massive floor-to-ceiling bookshelf, 
      pulling select volumes and adding them to the pile. 

      His younger son, TREVOR, 8, walks through the room on his way 
      to the kitchen.

                                  NOAH
                    Trevor. Come here for a second. 

      Trevor looks at Noah in trepidation. He s been in similar 
      situations. He knows they don t end well for him.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    What are you going to read this 
                    summer?

      Trevor shrugs.                                                                                      5.


                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Come on, you ve got three glorious, 
                      uninhibited months ahead of you and 
                    a whole bookshelf in front of you. 
                    Pretty soon, you ll be nine and 
                    then ten, you ll get a job, you ll 
                    meet a girl, you ll have kids and 
                    you ll never have the chance to 
                    read for pleasure again. You have 
                    to make the most of the time you ve 
                    got, little man. While the world is 
                    still your oyster.

      Trevor reaches up and pulls down a book.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                          (taking the book)
                    No. Not that one. 

                                  TREVOR
                    Why not?

                                  NOAH
                    You re too young.

                                  TREVOR
                    Is it dirty?

                                  NOAH
                    No. Who told you that?

                                  TREVOR
                    My friend at school. She said her 
                    mom read your book and she said it 
                    had too much s-e-x.

                                  NOAH
                    First of all, there s no such 
                    thing. And second of all, you go 
                    back to school and tell your little 
                    friend to tell her mother that you 
                    and all your siblings were the 
                    products of immaculate conception. 
                    So if she thinks my book is 
                      pornographic, it s her dirty mind 
                    at work, not mine. Tell her that.

      Trevor sighs. 

                                  TREVOR
                    Do I have to?                                                                                      6.



      Noah wanders through the house, looking for his son.

                                  NOAH
                    Martin? Martin?

                                  VOICE
                    So can you tell us a bit about who 
                    you were in the summer of 2013?

      Noah checks the kitchen .... it s empty.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      He checks the living room. Empty.

                                  VOICE
                    Mr. Kalish?

                                  NOAH S VOICE 
                    I don t understand the question.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Empty.                                                                                      8.


                                  NOAH
                    Martin? Come on dude, this isn t 
                    funny. Everyone is waiting on you.

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    What, exactly, do you want to know?

                                  VOICE
                    Anything you think is relevant.


                                                                            CUT TO:



      Nothing but sheets and towels. 

                                  VOICE
                    How were you feeling about your 
                    life?

      Noah closes the closet and heads down the hall towards a door 
      with a KEEP OUT sign on it.

                                  NOAH S VOICE 
                    Fine.

                                  VOICE
                    Can you say a little more?

      Noah s hand is on the doorknob-

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    Great. I was feeling great. My kids 
                    were healthy. My wife was 
                      beautiful.


                                                                            CUT TO:



      A terrible mess. Basketball posters on the wall. Clothes 
      strewn across the floor. Cereal boxes. Piles of sneakers.

      Noah crosses the room -

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    My life was pretty fucking perfect.

      And opens the door to an adjacent bathroom -                                                                                      9.



      Martin is dangling from the light fixture on the ceiling, 
      HANGING by a cord.

      Noah s heart stops.

                                  NOAH
                          (small)
                    No.

      Noah reaches up and rips the cord off the light. Martin falls 
      to the ground. He lays there in a crumpled huddle.

      Then he starts to giggle.

      It takes Noah a moment to realize what s just happened. He 
      SEES that the cord continues beneath Martin s collar. He 
      yanks up Martin s shirt to reveal a rock-climbing harness, 
      which was actually supporting the boy s weight.

      Noah grabs Martin by the arm and pulls him to his feet with 
      so much force he almost dislocates Martin s shoulder.

                                   MARTIN
                    Ow! Dad! What the fuck?



      Noah THROWS Martin into a chair.

                                  NOAH
                    What is wrong with you?

                                  MARTIN
                    It was a joke!

                                  NOAH
                    You thought that was funny? You 
                    think killing yourself is -

                                  MARTIN
                    I looked it up on the internet! It 
                    wasn t easy! They pay people a lot 
                    of money to fake a hanging. In, 
                    like, movies and shit. It s a real 
                    skill.

      Noah stares at Martin.

                                  MARTIN (CONT D)
                    I thought you d be proud of me.                                                                                    10.


                                  NOAH
                    Are you insane? Everyone is in the 
                    car waiting for you. Is it so much 
                    to ask that for one day - one day 
                    out of your entire life - that you 
                    think of somebody other than 
                    yourself?

      Martin s eyes start to swell. 

                                  MARTIN
                          (mumbling)
                    It was supposed to be a joke.

      Noah doesn t know what to do. He would like to punch 
      something. His kid, perhaps, or at least, a wall. Instead, he 
      takes a deep breath and sits down heavily on the edge of the 
      bed.

                                  NOAH
                    Dude, what is going on with you? 
                    Last summer you were this happy 
                    little kid. What happened?

      Martin doesn t respond. He can t. He s concentrating too hard 
      on not crying. Noah picks up a cereal box, looks inside and 
      RECOILS.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    You have to clean up this room. 
                    You re going to get maggots.

                                  MARTIN
                          (sniffling)
                    Now?

                                  NOAH
                    No, forget it. We ll have it 
                    fumigated at the end of the summer.

      Noah stands.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Let s go. Before your mother comes 
                    in.

      Martin doesn t move.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Come on, man.

                                  MARTIN
                    I hate Grandpa.                                                                                     11.


                                  NOAH
                    I know. So do I. But look at it 
                    this way. At least you stand to 
                    inherit some of his money when he 
                    dies.

                                  MARTIN
                    I won t take a penny of it.

                                  NOAH
                    You ll change your mind.



      Noah gets into the passenger s seat. Halla is driving.

                                  HALLA
                      Everything okay?

                                  NOAH
                    Fine.

                                  HALLA
                    What happened?

                                  NOAH
                    He had a stomach ache.

      Halla turns around, worried.

                                  HALLA
                    You feel okay, Marty?

      In the backseat, Martin nods, subdued. Noah counts the his 
      children.

                                  NOAH
                    One, two, three, four. 
                          (to Halla)
                    That s all the kids I ve got, 
                    right?

                                  HALLA
                    From me at least.

      Noah smiles. Halla turns on the car.                                                                                    12.



      A few hours later. Stuck in bumper-to-bumper beach traffic on 
      the one stretch of highway that takes vacationers from the 
      city out to the beaches of Long Island.

      In the backseat, Whitney is on her phone. Martin is staring 
      out the window. Stacey is sleeping. And Trevor is, for some 
      unknown reason, SINGING  Kumbaya  on an endless loop.

      In the front seat, Noah squints at the road. He closes his 
      eyes tightly and then opens them again.

                                  NOAH
                    That s weird. My vision just got 
                    blurry for a second. 

                                  HALLA
                    You okay?

                                  NOAH
                    Yeah, it cleared.

                                  HALLA
                    I spoke to my Dad. Guess what? He s 
                    read your book.

      Noah s jaw tightens automatically.

                                  NOAH
                    And?

                                  HALLA
                    He really liked it. He said he s 
                    excited to talk to you about it.

      Noah rolls his eyes.

                                  HALLA (CONT D)
                    What? 

                                  NOAH
                    Nothing. That s great. I m excited 
                    to talk to him too.

                                  HALLA 
                    I don t understand why you have 
                    such a chip on your shoulder about 
                    him. You act like he s out to get 
                    you or something.

      Noah doesn t answer.                                                                                    13.


                                  HALLA (CONT D)
                    He s actually quite generous to 
                    younger writers. He s famous for 
                    his mentorship-

      Noah closes his eyes again and takes a sharp breath in.

                                  HALLA (CONT D)
                          (worried)
                    What s going on?

                                  NOAH
                    Nothing. I have a headache.

                                  HALLA
                    Do we need to stop?

                                  NOAH
                    No.

      In the backseat, Trevor, who has fallen silent, starts to 
      sing  Kumbaya  again.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Trevor?

                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah?

                                  NOAH
                    I ll pay you ten dollars to shut 
                    up.

                                  TREVOR
                            (cheerfully)
                    Okay.

      The car inches forward.



      The family sit around a booth, looking at their menus. 
      Whitney is still wearing her sunglasses.

                                  HALLA
                    Whit, can you take those things off 
                    inside?                                                                                    14.


                                    WHITNEY
                    I m sure I can.

      Noah reaches across the table and takes the sunglasses off 
      his daughter s face.

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)
                    Hey!

      She looks up at him, angrily, through BLOODSHOT eyes.

                                  NOAH
                    Where were you last night?

                                    WHITNEY
                    I was at Courtney s.

                                  HALLA
                    What were you doing at Courtney s?

      A WAITRESS, early 30s, comes over to take their order. She s 
      very pretty, with dark hair and wide-set eyes. Her name tag 
      reads  Alison .

                                  ALISON
                    What can I get you all?

                                    WHITNEY
                    We were studying.

                                  MARTIN
                    I ll have the burger.

                                  NOAH
                    Really.

                                  ALISON
                          (to Martin)
                    Fries?

                                  MARTIN
                    Yeah.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Really.

                                  NOAH
                    Studying for what?

                                  ALISON
                          (to Martin)
                    Cheese?                                                                                    15.


                                  MARTIN
                    Yeah.

                                    WHITNEY
                    The SATs.

                                  NOAH
                    That test is in November.

                                  ALISON
                          (to Noah)
                    Something to drink?

                                  MARTIN
                    Sure. Surprise me. Something stiff.

      She looks up at him. He smirks. She smiles and writes his 
      order down.

                                  HALLA
                    Your father and I are not morons, 
                    Whitney. We know what it looks like 
                    when someone has been smoking pot.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Oh my God. First of all, no you 
                    don t because I ve been high, like, 
                    fifty times in the last year and 
                    you have never noticed -

                                  HALLA
                    Excuse me?

                                    WHITNEY
                    And second of all-
                          (to Alison)
                    Is there anything on this menu that 
                    is under 1000 calories? 

                                  ALISON
                    Probably not.

                                    WHITNEY
                    That s what I thought. I ll just 
                    have a diet Coke.

      Halla grabs a menu-

                                  HALLA
                          (to Alison)
                    Oh for God s sake, Miss, don t you 
                    have a salad or -                                                                                    16.


                                    WHITNEY
                    Forget it. I m not hungry.

                                  HALLA
                    You have to eat.

                                  TREVOR
                    Can I have the blueberry pancakes 
                    please?

                                  ALISON
                          (writing on her pad)
                    Excellent choice.

                                  NOAH
                          (to Halla)
                    Look at it this way ... if she s 
                    not hungry, she s not high.

                                  ALISON
                          (to Whitney)
                    I could get the cooks to make you 
                    an egg white omelette. That s what 
                    I usually have them make me.

      Whitney looks at her suspiciously.

                                    WHITNEY
                    But they cook in like, a ton of 
                    butter, right?

                                  ALISON
                    No, I ll make sure they use a 
                    nonstick frying pan. With a little 
                    cheese maybe-

                                    WHITNEY
                    No cheese.

                                  ALISON
                    No cheese. But how about some 
                    avocado? Because it s the good fat. 
                    The kind that helps you burn more 
                    fat.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Fine.

      She passes her menu over. Alison looks at Noah and WINKS.

      The noise of the scene starts to recede. There s a slight 
      RINGING in Noah s ears.                                                                                     17.


                                  VOICE
                    Do you remember the first time you 
                    saw her?

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    Like it was yesterday.

      Noah s POV: Alison is standing in a lotus position, with her 
      right foot braced against her inner left thigh. Noah can SEE 
      a glimpse of yellow underwear. 

                                  NOAH S VOICE (CONT D)
                    There was something so easy about 
                    her. So effortless.

      Alison turns to Noah and says something that he can t quite 
      hear. He frowns. 

                                  NOAH
                    Sorry, what?

                                  ALISON
                          (far away)
                    What would you like to order?

      He stares at her for a moment too long. Her gaze becomes 
      concerned.

                                  HALLA
                    Noah? Are you alright?

                                  NOAH
                    I m fine. I m fine. I just need to 
                    use the... where is the ...

                                  ALISON
                    Past the bar, take a left -

      Noah gets up and heads quickly across the restaurant, to a 
      door marked  RESTROOMS . He pushes through the door and then -


      BLACKOUT.



      A little hallway in front of the bathrooms. Noah is lying on 
      the floor, in a daze. His head is bleeding.

      Noah s POV: A figure kneels in front of him, blurred. He 
      blinks. It s clearly a woman. He blinks again and Alison 
      comes into focus.                                                                                     18.


                                  ALISON
                    Can you hear me? Are you alright?

                                  NOAH
                    I think so.

      He tries to sit up. He s overcome with dizziness -

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Oh God.

                                  ALISON
                    Should I call an ambulance?

                                  NOAH
                    No!

                                  ALISON
                    Are you sure?

                                  NOAH
                    How long was I out?

                                  ALISON
                    I m don t know. A few minutes?

                                  NOAH
                    Okay. I ll be fine. I m just going 
                    to rest here for a moment.


      The door to the restaurant swings open and a WOMAN enters. 
      She eyes Noah and Alison strangely, then disappears into the 
      women s bathroom.

      Alison turns back to Noah.

                                  ALISON
                    Let s at least give you some 
                    privacy. 

      She gets behind him, hooks her arms under his shoulders -

                                  NOAH
                    Wait, no. What are you -

      She pulls him into the men s room. The door closes behind 
      them.                                                                                    19.



      Alison props Noah up against the wall and crouches down to 
      examine the cut on his forehead. She moves his hair to touch 
      it. He GASPS in pain.

                                  ALISON
                    That needs stitches.

      Noah reaches up to feel for himself.

                                  NOAH
                    I m bleeding?

                                  ALISON
                    You must have hit your head on 
                      something.

                                  NOAH
                    Shit. Is there a first aid kit 
                    around here, or -

                                  ALISON
                    Why don t you just let me call you 
                    an ambulance?

                                  NOAH
                          (slightly panicked)
                    That really isn t necessary. If you 
                    would just pass me a few paper 
                    towels - 

                                  ALISON
                    Okay. Okay. You re in charge.

      Alison stands, wets a pile of towels and kneels in front of 
      him again to clean the wound. He WINCES.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    So is this like, a typical day for 
                    your family?

                                  NOAH
                    I m not usually the one bleeding, 
                    but yeah. 

      She smiles.

                                  ALISON
                    I m Alison, by the way.

      Noah looks up at her. She really is very beautiful. He has a 
      sudden urge to reach out to her. To pull her towards him -                                                                                    20.


                                  NOAH
                    I m Noah.

      A KNOCK on the door -

                                  MARTIN S VOICE
                    Dad! Are you in there?

                          (calling)
                    Yeah man. I m here. 

                                  MARTIN S VOICE
                    Is something wrong? 

                                  NOAH
                    No, just got the runs. You may not 
                    want to stand too close to the 
                    door.  

                                  MARTIN S VOICE 
                    That s disgusting, Dad. 

                                  NOAH
                    Tell your mother I ll be right 
                    back.

      They listen to the sound of Martin s footsteps walking away. 
      Alison turns back to Noah. Her face is inches from his own. 
      She is staring at him, curious. Waiting for an explanation. 

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I just don t want to worry them. 

      Beat. Then Alison nods and finally stands. 

                                  ALISON
                    Wait here. I ll find a band-aid.



      Noah slides back into the booth with the rest of his family. 
      Halla immediately spots the bandage under his hair.

                                  HALLA
                    Oh my God, what happened to you?

                                  NOAH
                      I slipped. Hit my head on the sink.

                                  HALLA
                    Just now? In the bathroom?                                                                                    21.


                                  NOAH
                    Yeah, the waitress brought me a few 
                    bandages -

      Halla watches Alison leave the restroom area and cross the 
      restaurant. 

                                  HALLA
                    She was in the bathroom with you?

                                  NOAH
                    No, of course not. She showed me 
                    where the first aid kit was and -

      A chicken finger hits his head. Courtesy of Stacey.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Is this for me? Why thank you very 
                    much. Is it a cookie? Can I dip it 
                    in your milk?

      Noah attempts to dip the chicken finger in Stacey s glass of 
      milk. She SQUEALS with delight.



      Noah enters from the outside. Alison is clearing off the 
      booth. He watches her from behind... her long, bare legs... 
      her slim waist... her neck...

      Just for a moment though. Then he pulls out his wallet, opens 
      it, finds a bill-

      She s moving back across the restaurant, trays in both hands, 
      stacked high with dirty dishes-

      Noah steps in front of her. She stops and smiles. It s 
      radiant.

                                  ALISON
                    Miss me?

                                  NOAH
                    I forgot to leave a tip. I m sorry. 
                    I m a little out of it today.

                                  ALISON
                      Understandably so.

                                  NOAH
                    This is, uh, this is for you.

      He holds up the twenty. But she has no hands. 

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Do you have a pocket or -

      He scans her body for someplace to tuck the money.                                                                                     23.


                                  ALISON
                    On my ass.

      She steps towards him. He looks over her shoulder, down her 
      back. Sees a pocket in the skirt.

                                  NOAH
                    Oh, you want me to ... okay.

      She moves even closer. Her breasts brush his chest. Before he 
      can think about what he s doing, Noah reaches around her 
      waist and slips the twenty into her back pocket.

                                  ALISON
                    Thank you.

                                  NOAH
                    You re welcome.

      Alison pivots gracefully and moves past him, into the 
      kitchen. He stares after her.



      Halla and her mother are making dinner in the kitchen. Stacey 
      is coloring at the table. Noah enters and retrieves another 
      beer from the fridge.

                                  NOAH
                    I m going to take a walk.

                                  MARGARET
                    Don t go far. We eat promptly at 
                    six. Otherwise Bruce gets 
                      heartburn. 

      Noah leaves.



      Halla applies a fresh bandaid to the cut on Noah s forehead.

                                  HALLA
                    How did it happen again?

                                  NOAH
                    I told you. I slipped in the 
                    bathroom while I was washing my 
                    hands. The floor was wet. It was 
                    just ... it was stupid.

      Halla hesitates-

                                  HALLA
                    I was afraid you were having 
                    another seizure.

                                  NOAH
                    Stop -

                                  HALLA
                    You weren t feeling well all day.

                                  NOAH
                    There s nothing wrong with me. The 
                    doctors said so. You re making us 
                    both crazy worrying about it. 

      Halla s eyes start to well up.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Hey. Hey, look at me.

      She looks at him.                                                                                    31.


                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    What s the matter?

      She shakes her head.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    What s going on?

                                  HALLA
                    I don t want to lose you.

                                  NOAH
                    Halla. Baby. You re not going to 
                    lose me. You will never, ever, lose 
                    me. 

      She moves into his chest and he wraps his arms around her. He 
      kisses the top of her head ... her ear ... her neck... her 
      mouth...



      Noah and Halla make love silently in a little attic room. 
      They move with the practiced familiarity of two people who 
      have been together for years, who know each other s bodies 
      like their own...

      Noah is close to coming. He shuts his eyes. His tongue slides 
      out of his mouth a little. Halla laughs.

      Noah s eyes pop open.

                                  NOAH
                    What?

                                  HALLA
                    Your face when you re about to come 
                    is funny.

      There s a SOUND outside the door. Halla freezes.

                                  HALLA (CONT D)
                    Did you hear something?

                                  NOAH
                    No.

                                  HALLA
                    I did. Stop, stop.

      From outside the door, comes a light scratching, and then-                                                                                    32.


                                  STACEY S VOICE
                    Mama? I had a bad dream.

      Noah groans and rolls off of his wife for the second time 
      that day. Halla scrambles out of bed and opens the door. 
      Stacey is huddled on the floor, crying. Halla swoops her 
      daughter up in her arms.

                                  STACEY
                    I don t like it here.

                                  HALLA
                    It s okay, baby. It s just a 
                    strange house. You can sleep with 
                    us. 



      The room is dark. Noah and Halla lie in bed with Stacey 
      between them. The girls are fast asleep. Noah is awake, 
      staring at the ceiling. He turns and looks out the window. 
      From this high up, he has a clear view, past the backyard, 
      over the dunes, all the way to the water. There, in the 
      distance, he can see the distinct flicker of fire.

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    I was a little restless, sure. But 
                    all men are a little restless.

      He turns and looks at his sleeping family. 



      Noah is sitting across the table from a POLICE OFFICER, mid-
      40s. His hair is shorter, almost cropped. He s older too, 
      though it s difficult to say how much. He looks beyond tired. 
      He s weary.

      He stares off into space, remembering.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Mr. Kalish? Mr. Kalish?

      Noah snaps back to the present moment.

                                  POLICE OFFICER (CONT D)
                    Then what happened?

                                  NOAH
                    What do you mean?

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    You walked her home and then?

      Noah looks at the cop. Confused. Innocent. He shrugs.

                                  NOAH
                    Nothing. I left.



                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                  PART TWO: ALISON



      Ditch Plains, Montauk. Dawn. The same beach cottage. Up on 
      stilts, with a view of the ocean.

      ALISON, 31, lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. She turns 
      over and looks at COLE, 35, sleeping next to her. He s facing 
      away from her, curled around a pillow.

      Alison stares at his back. Between his shoulders, there s a  
      striking TATOO of the archangel Gabriel, as a child, sitting 
      down, holding his knees to his chest. His wings are spread 
        majestically behind him. A sword lies at his feet.

      Alison reaches her hand out to touch the tattoo, then thinks 
      better of it, and slips out of bed instead.



      Cosy and cluttered. Shells from the Maldives, rocks from 
      Hawaii, wood carvings from Indonesia. The old wood floors are 
      covered with colorful rugs. The couches are deep and faded by 
      the sun.

      Alison fills a tea kettle with water and sets it to boil on 
      the stove.

                                  COLE (O.S.)
                          (from the other room)
                    Where d you go?

                                  ALISON
                    Nowhere. 

                                  COLE (O.S.)
                    Come back to bed.

                                  ALISON
                    Okay.

      She doesn t move.



      Alison climbs back into bed. Cole turns and wraps his arms 
      around her. 

                                  COLE
                    How d you sleep?                                                                                    41.


                                  ALISON
                    Fine.

                                  COLE
                    Any dreams?

      Alison frowns, trying to remember -

                                  ALISON
                    No.

                                  COLE
                    You re supposed to write them down 
                    as soon as you wake up.

      Alison looks to the bed stand on her left, where a silly pink 
       dream journal  remains in its packaging.

                                  ALISON
                    Okay.

                                  COLE
                    That lady we talked to said it 
                    would really help.

                                  ALISON
                    I know.

                                  COLE
                      I remember my dream.

      He pulls her closer to him. 

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    Want to hear?

                                  ALISON
                    I don t know... 
                          (she kisses his neck)
                    Was it dirty? 

                                  COLE
                    Not exactly.

      She moves down his chest.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    You were pregnant.

      She freezes.

                                  ALISON
                    Really.                                                                                    42.


                                  COLE
                    Really. 
                          (beat)
                    What do you think about that? 

      They stare at each other. It s a serious question. 

      Alison doesn t answer. Instead, she moves her mouth farther 
      down his stomach. Cole makes a half-hearted attempt to stop 
      her -

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    Ali...

      Her head disappears from frame. Cole gives up. He lies back 
      and groans. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Alison and Cole having sex. He s on top. She s staring at the 
      ceiling. Her arms are wrapped around him. But her expression 
      is oddly vacant. Like her mind is someplace else entirely. 

      Cole comes ferociously. He rolls to one side. She looks at 
      him and smiles.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    How was that?

                                  ALISON
                    Really good.

      Cole knows she s lying. He sighs. 



      In a dirty, cramped employee bathroom, Alison changes into 
      her uniform. A short, candy-striper dress. She rolls her hair 
      into a tight bun and covers it with a baseball cap that reads 
      ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE.



      Alison emerges from the bathroom into the restaurant kitchen. 
      The LINE COOKS are behind the counter, prepping food. 

                                  LINE COOKS
                    Alison! Que pasa?

                                  ALISON
                    Otro dia juntos en el paraiso.


      They laugh. She goes to the linen closet, finds an employee 
      apron, order pad, etc., then turns and bumps smack into -

      LUTHER, mid-thirties. Too handsome for his own good.                                                                                    45.


                                  LUTHER
                    Hey, good morning.

                                  ALISON
                    Luther. What are you doing here?

                                  LUTHER
                    I own the place.

                                  ALISON
                    It s seven am. Isn t that your 
                    bedtime?

                                  LUTHER
                    Ha.



      Alison stands behind the counter, wiping down menus and 
      stacks them in a pile. Luther hovers.

                                  LUTHER
                    So what s going on, Bailey?

                                  ALISON
                    Not much.

                                  LUTHER
                    You know what I was thinking about 
                    last night? That first summer you 
                    came to work for us. What were you, 
                    sixteen? My father still owned the 
                    place. I was working behind the 
                    counter. Remember that?

                                  ALISON
                    Sure.

                                  LUTHER
                    God, you were so hot back then, in 
                    your little candy stripes. 

      She tries to ignore him.

                                  LUTHER (CONT D)
                    Not to say there s anything wrong 
                    with you now, but fifteen years 
                    ago... jesus. I thought, if I just 
                    put my noodle in that girl s ca-ca 
                    before I turn 18, I will die a 
                    happy man. And then I did. The end.

      She glares at him. He grins.                                                                                    46.


                                  LUTHER (CONT D)
                    I love that story.

      Alison moves down the counter and begins scooping butter from 
      a large tubs, into individual serving trays.

                                  LUTHER (CONT D)
                    How s Cole?

                                  ALISON
                    He s fine.

                                  LUTHER
                    You guys still shacked up together?

                                  ALISON
                    We re married, Luther.

                                  LUTHER
                    Listen. I didn t want to be the one 
                    to have to tell you this, but the 
                    last couple of times I ve been down 
                    to Ditch Plains, he s been joined 
                    at the hip with this girl named 
                    Jolene.

                                  ALISON
                    She works for him. Just like I work 
                    for you.

                                  LUTHER
                    Okay maybe. But have you seen her? 
                    Because assuming she s not half the 
                    bitch you are (and honestly, how 
                    could she be) and assuming Cole has 
                    eyes in his head, I m telling you, 
                    it s just a matter of time until -

                                  ALISON
                          (annoyed)
                    Don t finish that sentence.

      JANE, late twenties, enters the restaurant from the outside 
      door, already in her uniform.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry I m late.

                                  LUTHER
                          (displaced sexual 
                              frustration)
                    Jesus Jane.

      She stops. Confused.                                                                                    47.


                                  JANE
                    What the hell are you doing here?

                                  LUTHER
                    This is my restaurant. Why does 
                    everyone keep asking me that?

                                  JANE
                          (to Alison)
                    How are you?

                                  ALISON
                    I m fine.

                                  JANE
                    Isn t today - 

                                  ALISON
                          (quickly)
                    Yes.

                                  JANE
                    Why did you come in?

                                  ALISON
                    I m meeting Cole later. 
                          (to Luther)
                    I have to leave a little early 
                    today. 

                                  LUTHER
                    What? Why? Is it like your fucking 
                      anniversary or something?

                                  JANE
                    Luther!

                                  LUTHER
                    What?

                                  JANE
                    Are you high?

                                  LUTHER
                    No, this is natural charm.


      He storms out of the restaurant, back into the kitchen. The 
      girls look at each other and laugh.                                                                                    48.



      Mid-afternoon. The lunch rush is finally clearing out. Jane 
      and Alison are both back behind the counter, looking worse 
      for wear. Alison consolidates ketchup bottles. Jane empties 
      the coffee and makes another pot.

                                  JANE
                    I went to see that psychic 
                      yesterday.

                                  ALISON
                    The one your cousin knows?

                                  JANE
                    Yeah. Her boat is parked down at 
                    the Marina.

      Jane finds a glittering business card in her purse and holds 
      it up for Alison to see.

                                  ALISON
                    And?

                                  JANE
                    She was incredible. I swear to God 
                    I didn t tell her a thing, but she 
                    knew my whole life. All about Tim. 
                    She knew that he was married and 
                    that he had three kids. She told me 
                    that it was an impossible 
                      relationship and that I had to end 
                    it.

                                  ALISON
                    I ve been telling you that for six 
                    months.

                                  JANE
                    Yes, but she s a professional. And 
                    she said she had a vision of me 
                    standing beneath a waterfall with 
                    the man I was going to marry.

                                  ALISON
                          (genuinely)
                    That s very exciting.

                                  JANE
                    Isn t it? Do you know where I can 
                    find a waterfall?                                                                                    49.


                                  ALISON
                    I think there are some in upstate 
                    New York. I ll borrow the truck 
                    from Cole and take you next 
                    weekend.

                                  JANE
                    Really? 

                                  ALISON
                    Sure. We ll make a day of it. Maybe 
                    go into the city afterwards. Find a 
                    club...

                                  JANE
                    What if we meet my soulmate?

                                  ALISON
                    We ll bring him with us.

                                  JANE
                    What if he doesn t like clubbing?


      A BELL rings to indicate the front door has opened. Noah and 
      his family enter the restaurant. Noah is holding Stacey, 
      who s half-dozing, sucking her thumb against his shoulder. He 
      talks to her softly, trying to wake her up. She nods and then 
      cranes her little neck to kiss him on the cheek.

                                  VOICE
                    Do you remember seeing him for the 
                    first time?

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    Yes.

                                  VOICE
                    Do you remember what you thought?

      No response.

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    Ms. Bailey?

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                      I remember he was holding his 
                    daughter.

      Halla looks around the restaurant for someone to help them. 
      She sees Jane and Alison behind the counter and gives an 
      impatient little wave.                                                                                    50.


                                  JANE
                      A six-top. Awesome.

      She grabs some menus off the pile.

                                  ALISON
                    I ll take them.

                                  JANE
                    Don t you have to go soon?  

                                  ALISON
                    I ll cover this table. Then I ll 
                    leave.

      Alison takes the menus from Jane and heads across the 
      restaurant.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Welcome to Elmo s. Will you need a 
                    high chair?

      Noah looks up at her and smiles.

                                  NOAH
                    That would be great.


                                                                            CUT TO:



      A few minutes later. Alison fills six glasses with ice water.

      She notices the card for Jane s psychic lying on the counter. 
      She picks it up, considering...

      Suddenly, Noah and Stacey appear on stools in front of her. 
      Alison quickly pockets the card.

                                  ALISON
                    Why hello.

                                  NOAH
                    Hello. We re sorry to bother you. 
                    We were wondering if you had any 
                    crayons.

                                  ALISON
                    I bet I do.

      Alison smiles at Stacey. The little girl just looks at her 
      shyly. She s sucking on a necklace of plastic beads.                                                                                    51.


                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    My God, she s cute.

                                  NOAH
                    Yeah, I think so.

      Alison finds a pail of crayons behind the counter.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Oh Stacey. Look what the nice 
                    waitress gave you. What do you say?

                                  STACEY
                    Thank you very much.

      Alison s heart melts. 

                                  ALISON
                    You re very welcome, Darling. 

      Meanwhile, Noah has put two crayons up his nose and he s 
      coloring with them on the back of paper place mat.

                                  NOAH
                    Look at me. I m a coloring walrus!

      Stacey laughs. Alison notices one of the beads in her 
      necklace is MISSING.

                                  ALISON
                    Oh no, you ve lost a bead.

                                  NOAH
                    What?

      Noah takes the necklace out of Stacey s mouth and looks at 
      it.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Shit. Stacey, did you swallow one 
                    of these?

      Before she can respond, Noah dumps the crayons out on the 
      counter. Then he plugs Stacey s nose, put his finger in her 
      mouth and makes her vomit into the pail. It all happens so 
      quickly, and he s so nonchalant about it, that Stacey doesn t 
      even have time to get scared. She whimpers a little, when 
      it s over, but doesn t cry. Noah pulls her onto his lap.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    You re okay, baby. You re okay.

      Noah looks down into the bucket and pulls out a bead.                                                                                    52.


                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Look at what was in your tummy! 
                    That s not food.

      Alison stares at him, amazed. She s never seen a man handle a 
      child so easily.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                          (re: the bucket)
                    I m sorry about the -

                                  ALISON
                    No, it s okay. Is she-

                                  NOAH
                    She s fine. Maybe, if you have some 
                    apple juice or something?

                                  ALISON
                    I ll bring it right over to you.

      Noah picks up Stacey and carries her back to the booth. 
      Alison turns to the soda fountain, reeling.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Alison carries a tray full of drinks across the restaurant. 
      Noah comes towards her, from the other direction. He looks 
      suddenly quite pale. There are sweat beads forming along his 
      hairline

                                  ALISON
                    Are you alright?

                                  NOAH
                    Fine. Could you just tell me where 
                    the bathroom - 

                                  ALISON
                    Past the bar. Door on the left.

      Noah presses past her, stumbling a little. She watches him 
      go, concerned.



      Alison pushes through a door marked  Restrooms , which opens 
      unto a little hallway. Noah is sitting on the ground, in a 
      daze. His head is bleeding.                                                                                    53.


                                  ALISON
                    Oh my God! Are you alright?

                                  NOAH
                    I think so.

                                  ALISON
                    What happened?

                                  NOAH
                    I m not sure. I may have had a 
                    seizure.

                                  ALISON
                      A seizure? 

                                  NOAH
                    Just a little one.

                                  ALISON
                    Wait, I ll go get your wife.

                                  NOAH
                    No -

                                  ALISON
                    No?

                                  NOAH
                    I ll be alright. Could you just... 
                    could you sit with me for a second?

      Alison looks at him warily.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I m really okay. This has happened 
                    before. I just need to rest for a 
                    moment.

      She sits down next to him. He looks at her. Tries to smile.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I m Noah, by the way.

                                  ALISON
                    I m Alison.

      Noah leans his head back against the wall and closes his 
      eyes. Alison watches him. She s suddenly overwhelmed with 
      tenderness for this man. She wants to reach out to him. To 
      take his hand or something.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    This really isn t your day, is it?                                                                                    54.


                                  NOAH
                          (eyes still closed)
                    I ve had worse.

      A phone RINGS in Alison s pocket. She takes it out and looks 
      at the caller ID. It s Cole.

      Alison quickly silences the ringer and puts the phone away.

                                  ALISON
                    Sorry. Wait here. I ll find you a 
                    bandaid.

      Noah opens his eyes and looks at her.

                                  NOAH
                          (sincerely)
                    Thank you. 



      The restaurant is practically empty. Alison clears off the 
      carnage that Noah s family left in the booth. Jane comes up 
      with a tray, to help her.

                                  JANE
                    Please go. Let me finish this.

                                  ALISON
                    You sure?

                                  JANE
                    Yes, go. Get out of here. Tell Cole 
                    I say hello.

                                  ALISON
                    You re the greatest.

      Alison removes her hat and apron and shakes out her hair.

                                  JANE
                    How d you make out?

                                  ALISON
                    What? Oh, they stiffed me.

                                  JANE
                    Really?

      Alison nods.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Assholes.                                                                                    55.



      Alison points to a chocolate cupcake covered with rainbow 
      sprinkles.

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    Look, I can t really tell you what 
                    I was thinking. That first year, 
                      everything was still such a blur.

                                  ALISON
                    Three please. And some candles.



      WHACK. A knife descends on a cutting board, severing a fish 
      head. 

      A woman, ISABEL, mid-60s, with a crown of kinky grey hair, 
      tosses the head in a nearby bucket. Alison nervously sits at 
      a little card table, watching her.

                                  ISABEL
                    So you re a friend of Jane s?

                                  ALISON
                    We grew up together.

                                  ISABEL
                    Where?

                                  ALISON
                    Here.

      Isabel turns and looks at Alison over her crooked wire-rimmed 
      frames.

                                  ISABEL
                    In Montauk?

                                  ALISON
                    That s right.

                                  ISABEL
                    A native. That s very good. That 
                    means your reading will be very 
                    clear. 

      With one swift motion, Isabel tears out the fish s spine.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Isabel sits across the card table from Alison. A line of 
      tarot cards are spread between them.                                                                                     57.


                                  ISABEL
                    And the final card.

      Isabel flips over The Devil.

                                  ISABEL (CONT D)
                    Lucifer. That s worrisome. 

                                  ALISON
                    Am I going to die?

                                  ISABEL
                    No, that s not what Lucifer means. 
                    This is the card of temptation. 
                    Something is coming. Something... 
                      powerful... wild... ... it may be a 
                    very good thing... or he may 
                    enslave you. 

                                  ALISON
                    He?

      Isabel frowns at the cards.

                                  ISABEL
                    This is very strange.

      She holds up another card. It s the picture of a very young 
      squire. 

                                  ALISON
                    Who is that?

                                  ISABEL
                    The Page of Cups. Do you have any 
                    children?

      Beat.

                                  ALISON
                    No.

                                  ISABEL
                    Huh. Then I think you are about to 
                    receive a message. Be careful with 
                      messenger. He is very sensitive. 
                    You must be clear with him. Or he 
                    will misunderstand you. He wants to 
                      misunderstand you.

      Alison picks up the card and stares at the smiling little 
      boy.                                                                                    58.



      Alison is back at the same the intersection. Again, she 
      stares down the dirt road lined with holly trees. 

      She gets off her bike and starts to walk it slowly up the 
      lane.



      Alison opens the oven. She pulls out a tray with dried pot 
      leaves spaced in neat rows. 



      Alison sits in the interrogation room. She looks radically 
      different. She s wearing a business suit. Her wild hair is 
      pulled tightly back and clipped into a neat bun. There s a 
      briefcase on the floor next to her. She s older too, though, 
      like Noah, it s difficult to tell how much. 

      She s staring off at the wall...

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Ms. Bailey?

      Alison turns and looks at him.

                                  POLICE OFFICER (CONT D)
                          (gently)
                    It s almost three o clock. You said 
                    you had to pick up your kid at 
                    three.

      Alison looks at her watch.

                                  ALISON
                    Oh God, thank you. Can I go then?

      The officer nods.

                                    OFFICER
                    You can go.

      Alison gathers her things and leaves.


                                        END OF PILOT
