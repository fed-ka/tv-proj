      MacLeod and Theresa walk arm-in-arm in the moonlit garden,
      the Duenna now walking behind them, chaperoning.

                                            THERESA
                            (with a smile)
                        I think it's fifty years since a man
                        turned my Tialita's head.
                              (gently chiding)
                        Be careful you do not break her heart. 
                          A gentleman of Spain does not speak
                        to a woman of love unless he has
                        serious intentions.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (beat)
                        Neither does a gentleman of Scotland.

      He plucks a rose from the garden and offers it to her. 
      She takes it and they continue walking.

                                            THERESA
                        All my life I have been accused by
                        my teachers of being forward and
                        outspoken.  Of having too many
                          opinions for a young woman.
                              (beat)
                        Do you think that I am too forward
                        or have too many opinions?

                                            MACLEOD
                        No.

      Theresa looks at her Duenna.  The look says volumes.  The
      Duenna stops for a moment and turns away to look at the
      night, giving the couple what privacy they are allowed.

                                            THERESA
                        Good.  Then it won't shock you when
                        I tell you that I love you and have
                        been in love with you from the very
                        first moment I met you.

      MacLeod reacts, then touches her face gently.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You know nothing of me, Theresa.

                                            THERESA
                        I know what I feel.

                        Good opinion or not, your father
                        will want you to wed someone from a
                        noble Spanish family.

                        I know enough.  I know how I feel
                        when you touch me.  I know when I
                        look into your eyes that you love
                        me.  Nothing else matters.

                              leans close and
                              whispers)

      He kisses her tenderly.  The Duenna watches with calibrated
      indulgence, then --

                                            DUENNA
                          Theresa?  It's getting chill... 
                        time to go in.

      The Club is closing.  Richie and MacLeod are leaving,
      stepping into the street, and Richie looks a little

                        If you want to learn, Anna could

                          I thought Luisa was the dancer.

      MacLeod pauses a beat, a slight shadow passing over his
      face.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Luisa's good.  Anna was the best.

      As they round a corner they see --

      ANNA AND LUISA by the stage door, in the midst of a heated
      argument.

                          practice.

                        It's not my fault you can't dance
                          anymore.

      Anna, stung by the remark, slaps her daughter across the
      face.  They stand motionless, frozen in the moment.  Anna's
      emotion carries her to a brief moment in her past.



      We see almost surreal FLASHES of Anna dressed in a beautiful
      long, red coat as she crosses the boulevard

      THEN THE CAR

      That bears down on her, the driver unseen.

      Raises her hand to ward off the oncoming vehicle.

      MacLeod steps up to her and takes her arm.

                        Good night, Duncan.

      Drawing up her dignity, she moves away, leaning on her
      cane as she walks.  MacLeod turns to look in the direction
      of the disappearing limo.



      MacLeod and Richie are working on the deck of the barge. 
      Richie senses MacLeod's distraction.

      Richie tries to lighten MacLeod's mood.

                        So, how'd you learn to dance like

      THE QUAI

      where Anna is leaving a taxi, walking toward them.  Her
      face is tight with worry.  MacLeod drops what he's doing
      and moves to meet her.

      NEW ANGLE

      As MacLeod reaches Anna on the quai.

                        What's wrong?  Luisa?

                        She never came home last night.



      The limo is stopped on the quai.  Leaning casually against
      it -- Consone.  He is plucking, one by one, the petals of
      a FLOWER he holds in his hand.

      MacLeod approaches, and it's clear that he hates Consone
      deeply.  Consone flexes a gloved hand with an elegant
      flourish, and plucks out the last three petals.

                                            CONSONE
                        She loves me not... She loves me.
                              (beat, looking up)
                        Is that ferocious look really meant
                        for me?

      MacLeod reins in his anger.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Where's Luisa Hidalgo?

                                            CONSONE
                        Where she wants to be.  With me, of
                        course.

      He runs his eyes over the barge with disapproval.

                                            CONSONE
                          I thought you had hopes of becoming
                          a gentleman someday, MacLeod... but
                        here you are, living in a dump on

                        You're still a Gypsy.

      MacLeod pushes in close to him.

                        Then let's find somewhere more to

                              (fierce)
                        We'll talk about old times.

                                            CONSONE
                        I remember you as clumsy, MacLeod.
                              (beat)
                        But hot stupid.

      There's a hint of steel in his voice.



      Consone faces MacLeod.

                                            CONSONE
                          I haven't come here to fight, MacLeod. 
                        I'm here to offer you a simple choice.
                              (beat)
                        Stay away from the Hidalgos -- or
                        die.

                                            ANNA (O.S.)
                        You.

      Anna moves toward him, all the hate and pain rushing back.

                                            ANNA
                        The police stopped searching, but I
                        have found you.

      She throws herself at him, trying to strike him with her
      hands, her cane.

                                            ANNA
                          Monster!  Diablo!  You killed him!
                        You killed my Rafael!

      Consone catches her hand, stopping the cane.

                                            CONSONE
                        There is a limit to my patience,
                          MacLeod.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Anna, no!

      He tries to pull her back, but she's hysterical.  Luisa
      hurries from the Limo.

                                            LUISA
                        Mama, stop it!  What are you doing!

      Anna freezes at the sight of Luisa.

                                            ANNA
                        Him...?  You're with him!?

      She pulls away from MacLeod and SLAPS Luisa across the
      face.

                                            ANNA
                        He killed Rafael!  He killed your
                        father!

      Luisa's hand goes to her stinging face, her eyes well with
      tears.

                                            LUISA
                        Are you crazy, Mama?!  That was twenty-
                        five years ago!  Look at him.  Think,
                        Mama.  How can it be the same man?

      Anna falters as it hits her.

                                            ANNA
                        But he looks exactly like... I
                        thought...
                              (faltering)
                        I'm sorry....

      She reaches for Luisa, but Luisa flinches away.

                                            LUISA
                        Don't!  Don't touch me!  Just stay
                        out of my life!

      Holding her face, she turns and runs to the limo.  Anna
      takes a faltering step after her.

                                            ANNA
                        Luisa, come back!  I'm sorry!

      But Luisa gets in and slams the door.  MacLeod holds Anna.

                                            MACLEOD
                          Richie... take Anna home.

      Richie gently pulls the shell-shocked Anna away.  As she
      moves, she keeps looking back at Consone.

      Consone turns to MacLeod, composes a look of sympathy.

                                            CONSONE
                        Maybe therapy would help.

                                            MACLEOD
                        See you... soon.

                                            CONSONE
                        Wrong choice.

      He adjusts a glove, slips into the limo and slams the door. 
      The limo pulls silently away.  MacLeod watches it go.  And
      OFF his look --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:



      MacLeod approaches hurriedly.  As he reaches the gate in
      the garden wall

                                            THERESA (O.S.)
                        Never!  I would rather die!

      MacLeod hastily pushes on the gate.  Locked.



      MacLeod comes over the wall and lands inside the courtyard. 
      He hurries toward the house.  As he does, Theresa runs
      out, sobbing, and nearly runs right into him.

                                            MACLEOD
                          Theresa!

      She stumbles, startled; he reaches out and steadies her.

                                            THERESA
                        Oh, Duncan...  You're too late.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (understands)

                        I'll speak to your father.  I'll

                                            CONSONE (O.S.)
                        He already has.  His daughter will
                        marry one of Madrid's finest
                        gentlemen.

      They both turn to see that CONSONE has followed MacLeod
      into the garden.

                                            CONSONE
                            (to MacLeod)
                        Leave.  I won't ask again.

      MacLeod shakes his head.

                                            CONSONE
                        She is my betrothed.  Have you no
                        honor?

                                            MACLEOD
                        How can you force yourself on a woman
                        who doesn't want you?

                                            CONSONE
                        You underestimate Theresa, MacLeod.
                        You think you can turn her head with
                        your gypsy dancing and talk of love...
                              (beat)
                        But she knows who she is.  What she
                        Is.  And where her duty lies.

                                            THERESA
                        No!  I'll never marry you!  I hate
                        you!

      Consone reacts, stung.  He turns to MacLeod.

                                            CONSONE
                          I warned you.
                            (he draws his sword)
                        Let's see if the barbarian can die
                        like a gentleman.

      MacLeod salutes him with his sword.

                                            MACLEOD
                          Theresa, go inside.

                                            THERESA
                        No!  No, don't do this --
                            (a plea)
                        Otavio, you mustn't.  Please, he's
                        your friend.

                                            CONSONE
                        No more.

      With that, he strikes.  MacLeod reacts, parries well.  His
      fighting instincts are alive, every nerve alert for
      Consone's next move, his eyes locked on his opponent.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96514  "Duende"               30.    Final Shooting Script 11/16/96

      The two fighters exchange rapid-fire strikes and parries,
      the long swords flashing as move and counter-move are
      executed with precision.

      Consone may be the Master of the form, but MacLeod has
      been well taught.  He presses the offensive, testing his
      opponent, driving Consone around the imaginary circle with
      a series of attacks to head and heart.

      Consone deftly dodges and parries, surprises MacLeod with
      a low move, slashing his thigh.

                                            THERESA
                        No!

      MacLeod's attention is momentarily diverted by her outcry.

                                            MACLEOD
                          Theresa, go inside.

      It's the moment's distraction Consone needed.  He attacks,
      catching MacLeod out of position, and his blade finds its
      target in MacLeod's shoulder.

      MacLeod falls to his knees, his own sword dropping from
      his nerveless hand.  His eyes are wide with astonishment
      and realization -- he's about to die.

                                            CONSONE
                            (to Theresa)
                        Go now.

      But, as Consone raises his sword for the beheading stroke --

                                            THERESA
                        Wait.

      The desperation is gone from her voice.  Her tone is flat,
      firm.  It stops Consone.

                                            THERESA
                        Spare his life, Otavio.  Spare him...
                        and I'll marry you.

                                            MACLEOD
                        No!

      He's on hands and knees, weak, disoriented -- he can't
      stop her.  Theresa doesn't look at him.  She can't.

                                            THERESA
                            (to Consone)
                        Do this for me, and I will be your
                        wife.  Kill him, and I will be in a
                        convent by nightfall.

                          I swear.

      A long moment.  Finally -- Consone releases MacLeod from
      the point of death with great satisfaction.  He offers his
      arm to Theresa.  She takes it.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Theresa...

      She finally looks at him, eyes shining with unshed tears.

                                            THERESA
                        I have given my word.  Go.  Go, and
                        think of me no more.

                        It is my honor, now.

      She turns away.  As she and Consone move off, push in on
      MacLeod, on his knees in the dirt, helpless and shattered.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

                              (doubtful)

                        It's a lot of things.

      Richie watches as MacLeod opens the carved box, removes
      the dagger and sword, preparing to step into the circle.

      Slowly, ceremonially, he starts to move the blades, moving
      faster as his body remembers the moves he learned 150 years
      ago.

                        You really think this guy's gonna
                        stand in that thing while you fight?

      MacLeod doesn't stop moving.

                                            MACLEOD
                        This little circle was his world. 
                        He was the master of it.
                              (beat)
                        He'll come.

                              (exasperated)
                        Why not just whack the guy?  Why
                        play his game, on his turf?

      MacLeod pauses.  This is hard to put into words.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Because it all comes back to this.

                                            RICHIE
                              (shakes his head at
                              this folly)
                        Mac, this isn't poetry.  It's a fight
                        to the death!  Why give him an edge
                        you don't need to?
                              (beat)
                        If Consone beat you before, he could
                        beat you again.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (tight)
                        I'm better now.

                                            RICHIE
                        Yeah.
                              (beat)
                        But maybe he is, too.

      MacLeod pauses, the blades stopping in mid-flight.  He has
      thought of it -- but he doesn't care.  He continues to
      spin the blades, and OFF THIS --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        ACT THREE

      FADE IN:



      MacLeod is gazing at one of framed PHOTOS on the wall: a
      photo of Anna, a striking young beauty, dancing.  She looks
      like a bird caught in mid-flight.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Beautiful.

      He moves past other photos of Anna in different poses,
      different costumes.

                                            MACLEOD
                        The Soleares, Baile Grande, the
                          Fandango...
                              (turning to Anna)
                        I heard no one moved like you, Anna. 
                        No one.

      Anna shrugs, modestly accepting the compliment.

                                            ANNA
                        I was pretty good, wasn't I?
                            (sad smile)
                          I thought my Luisa would be better.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Maybe she will be.

      She turns to him.

                                            ANNA
                        She's all I have left, Duncan.  I
                        don't want to lose her.
                              (beat)
                        Even if she never danced again.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You won't lose her.
                              (beat)
                        Are you certain she hasn't mentioned
                          anything about where he lives?  Where
                        he takes her?

                                            ANNA
                          Nothing.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What about the other dancers in the
                          company?

                                            ANNA
                        They tell each other everything. 
                        But they're her friends.
                              (beat)
                        I'm the boss.  They'll never tell
                        me.  And they've seen you with me
                        before.  They know we're friends.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (beat)
                        Then we'll just have to find
                        Someone they don't know.

      And off his thoughtful look --



      An expensive house in the outskirts of Paris, at the end
      of a drive.  MacLeod climbs from his car, and gazes at the
      house for a long moment.  An old HOUSEKEEPER is exiting
      the house.  As MacLeod sees her --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:



      Theresa's Old Duenna is picking roses.  Two years have
      passed since MacLeod lost Theresa -- but the Duenna looks
      10 years older, her face lined.

                                            MACLEOD (O.S.)
                            (loud whisper)
                        Senora!

      She turns to the sound.  MacLeod has ridden up on horseback. 
      She almost faints when she sees who it is.  She hurries to
      the gate.

                                            DUENNA
                        You're mad, Senor.  What are you
                        doing here?!

      He dismounts.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I have to talk to Theresa.

                                            DUENNA
                        Senor Consone will kill you if he
                        sees you.  Please, ride on.  Leave
                        this place.

                                            MACLEOD
                        After I see Theresa... just for a
                        moment.

                                            DUENNA
                          Impossible.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Then please... at least take her a
                          message.

                                            DUENNA
                        Oh, Senor MacLeod.  You don't know
                        what you ask.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Tell her... tell her I haven't
                          forgotten her.  Tell her I cannot. 
                          I haven't had her out of my heart
                        for two years.

      He takes her hand, tearing up --

                                            MACLEOD
                        Senora, I know you had a love when
                        you were young.  A man you never
                          married.
                              (beat)
                        If he rode up to this gate today,
                          wouldn't you want to see him?  To
                        talk with him?

      The Duenna's face shows how right MacLeod is... He pushes
      the advantage:

                                            MACLEOD
                        If you love her, Senora, please.
                        Let me see her.

      Duenna sighs deeply, then relents.  Opens the gate.

                                            DUENNA
                        Come, Senor... prepare yourself.

      She hurries out through the gate.



      MacLeod and the Duenna stand at Theresa's grave.  The
      headstone reads: "THERESA DEL GLORIA CONSONE, Beloved
      Daughter, Sister, and Wife, 1829-1853.  Gone to God."

      MacLeod looks down at the gravestone in silent grief.

                                            DUENNA
                        Only three months ago.
                              (beat)
                          I shouldn't have told you.  Better
                        you should think of her as you knew
                        her.
                              (beat)
                        She is happier now, I am sure of it.

                        An accident.

                        The stairs.



      The Duenna turns away from MacLeod.  Her tone changes.

                                            DUENNA
                        She must have slipped.

      Something about her tone alerts MacLeod

                                            MACLEOD
                        Was she alone when it happened?

                              silence)
                        Was he there?

                              (unconvincing)
                        No, Senor, you mustn't say such a
                        thing!

      She crosses herself devoutly.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Tell me the truth, Tialita.

                                            DUENNA
                        No one saw anything.  We only heard.
                              (beat)
                        She never stopped loving you.  It
                        made the senor insane with jealousy.

      His hand goes to his sword.  The Duenna reacts in fear.

      She grabs his arm with surprising strength, her voice filled
      with grief and passion.

                        She gave her happiness to spare your

                        you were safe.

      The Duenna's tears finally come.

      MacLeod's gaze moves down to the door where an old SPANISH
      HOUSEKEEPER is just stepping out, locking up the house. 
      He approaches her.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I'm looking for Senor Consone.

                        happy together.

                              pride)
                        Luisa Consone, since this afternoon. 
                        The senor gave us the week off.
                            (a smile)
                        Newlyweds.  You know how they are.

                        I've come to bring him a gift.

                                              HOUSEKEEPER
                        Would you like to leave it?  I'll
                        make sure he receives it.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Thank you, Senora... but I'd like to
                        give it to him in person.

      She nods and moves off.  As she goes, MacLeod turns back
      to watch the house.



      The car hits Anna with a shuddering impact.

      ANNA

      Lies there motionless.

      THE CAR

      Drives away.  We see the driver is Consone.



      MacLeod waits in his car, watching Consone's house.

      HEADLIGHTS

      Sweep across the drive.  A car pulls up.  There's no BUZZ. 
      No Consone.

      LUISA

      Gets out of the car.  She moves toward the house.  As she
      reaches the front gate, pulls it open

      MACLEOD'S HAND

      Pushes it shut.

      Luisa turns in surprise.

                                            LUISA
                        Duncan!

                                            MACLEOD
                        Where's Consone?

                                            LUISA
                        Did my mother send you?  Look, I
                        love her, but she can't keep doing
                        this.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Where is he?

                                            LUISA
                        He had an errand to run.  He'll be
                        home soon.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Get your things.  You're leaving.
                              (beat)
                        You don't know what he's done... 
                        who he is.

                                            LUISA
                        I know enough.

      MacLeod winces at the reminder of Theresa's words to him.

                        What if I told you held been married
                        before?

                                            LUISA
                        So what?

                                            MACLEOD
                        And that the woman he married meant
                        a great deal to me.

                                            LUISA
                        I think you should leave.

                              (intense)
                        And he killed her.

                                            LUISA
                        You're as crazy as my mother.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Your mother's not crazy.

      MacLeod gets the BUZZ.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Go inside, Luisa.  And stay there.

                                            LUISA
                        But --

                        Now.

      MacLeod's intensity frightens Luisa.  She quickly does as
      she's told.  MacLeod moves down the drive to face

      CONSONE

      as he arrives.

                                            CONSONE
                          Highlander.  I always seem to find
                        you bothering my women.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Theresa was never yours.

                                            CONSONE
                        Don't flatter yourself.  She never
                        thought of you again.

                        What you mean to say is that she
                        never spoke of me again.
                              (pressing)
                        But she thought of me, Consone.  She
                        thought of me every night.  Every
                        time you looked at her.  Every time
                        you touched her.

      Consone is shaken, but covers quickly.

                        Forget her, Consone.  I sent her
                        back to her mother.

                                            CONSONE
                          Impossible!  She's mine.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You think any woman would stay with
                        you once she knew the truth?

      Consone's face darkens.

                                            CONSONE
                        She can run all she likes.  If it
                        takes another twenty years, I'll
                        find her.



                                            CONSONE
                        If she has a lover, I'll kill the
                        lover; if she has a daughter, I'll
                        seduce the daughter.

      The door is flung open and Luisa runs out of the house.

                                            LUISA
                        You son-of-a-bitch!

      Luisa flings herself at Consone.  MacLeod hauls her back.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Luisa, don't!

                                            CONSONE
                        That was a mistake.  It's too bad.
                              (beat)
                        For both of you.

      MacLeod gets between Consone and Luisa.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (giving her a shove)
                        Go, Luisa!  Get out!  Run!

      She hesitates, then sees his expression -- and runs to her
      car.  As she goes, Consone draws his sword.

                                            CONSONE
                        I'll find her.  I'll have her.
                            (with sarcasm)
                        Your noble sacrifice will be for
                          nothing.

      MacLeod draws his own in return.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Did I say anything about a sacrifice?

      Consone bows acknowledgment.  Gestures MacLeod toward --



      A tiled patio with the circle of combat embedded in the
      design.  The two opponents face each other, twin blades in
      hand.  A bow of respect, and then the fight is engaged.

      There's no question that Consone is still a Master.  He
      moves around the circle with ease and grace -- thrusting,
      parrying, slicing.  MacLeod defends himself well, but can't
      get the upper hand.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96514  "Duende"               47.    Final Shooting Script 11/16/96



1437CONTINUED:1437

      Consone is working up a sweat.  This isn't as easy as he
      expected.  More than once he's forced to parry hastily,
      breaking form to protect his flanks.  MacLeod grins at him
      wickedly.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Still think you could make a swordsman
                        of me, Otavio?

                                            CONSONE
                        You were born a pig farmer, and you'll
                        always be a pig farmer.

      He makes a concerted rush, forcing MacLeod onto the
      defensive.  MacLeod's face shows his surprise -- Consone
      has moved the fight up a level, and MacLeod is pressed to
      deflect his opponent's sword.  He'll have to win this
      quickly, or not at all.

      MacLeod dodges Consone's blade, sees an opening, advances --

      And finds CONSONE'S BLADE in his path.  The Master has
      anticipated him.  Consone's stabs him with his blade.

                                            CONSONE
                        And you die a pig farmer.

                                            MACLEOD
                          Maybe...

      MacLeod drops his dagger, grabs Consone's arm in his left
      hand, and pulls himself deeper onto the sword and closer
      to his opponent.

      If it hurts, he doesn't feel it -- he's reached that state
      of grace that the dancers call duende.

      Consone is taken completely by surprise.  He's unprotected
      as MacLeod swings with his free hand --

                                            MACLEOD
                        ...but not today.

      Consone's body falls.  MacLeod, gravely wounded, falls
      beside it.

      The Quickening plays along the lines and arcs of the
      Mysterious Circle, outlining MacLeod's body against the
      tiled pattern.



      Richie's out on the deck of the barge.  Pacing back and
      forth.  He alternates between nervously looking at his
      watch and at the quai where MacLeod should be arriving.

                                            RICHIE
                            (to himself)
                        C'mon, Mac.  Where are you?

      As if on cue, the BUZZ.  Richie turns in relief to see

      MACLEOD'S CAR

      Finally arriving.  As a weary MacLeod climbs out, he sees
      Richie approach.

                                            RICHIE
                        You won.

      MacLeod nods.

                        Was he as good as you remembered?

                        He was better.

      He starts moving up the gangplank.  Richie stays on his
      heels.

      MacLeod stops at the top of the steps, thoughtful.

                        Consone thought the fight was all
                        about control.  About mastering every
                        line, every step.

                        you do things beyond what your
