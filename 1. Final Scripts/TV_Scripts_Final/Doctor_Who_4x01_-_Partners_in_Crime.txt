22EXT. NOBLES' HOUSE - DAY 1

      Fast, cheeky music, sc.2-13. 

      DONNA steps out of her front door.  Smart, head held high;
      she's on a mission.  And as Donna heads left to right -

                                                                            CUT TO:

66EXT. ADIPOSE INDUSTRIES - DAY 1

      DONNA stops in the street, looks up...

      A TOWER BLOCK looming above.  Cool, sleek, stylish, the
      London HQ of Adipose Industries.

      Deep breath, Donna heads towards it.

                                                                            CUT TO:

77EXT. ADIPOSE INDUSTRIES - DAY 1

      THE DOCTOR stops in the street, looks up...

      THE TOWER BLOCK looming above, Adipose Industries.  But
      this is the opposite side to Donna's, the back.

      Deep breath, the Doctor heads towards it.

                                                                            CUT TO:

99EXT. ADIPOSE INDUSTRIES, BACK YARD - DAY 1

      THE DOCTOR's down a flight of steps, sonicking a basement
      door - PRAC EXPLOSION on the lock, and he slips inside.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      The doors on the right-hand lift open - it's come up from
      the basement - and THE DOCTOR steps out, heads off, curious.

                                                                            CUT TO:

1313INT. CINEMA - DAY 1

      Part of the Tower Block HQ, with Adipose Industries logos
      on the walls.  Slogan: The Fat Just Walks Away.

      The logo is on screen, as MISS FOSTER steps forward, at
      the front.  She's 40s, handsome, strong.  She addresses
      the audience, 40 PEOPLE or so, scattered about, taking
      notes - they're JOURNALISTS; this is a Press Launch.

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    Adipose Industries.  The twenty-
                    first century way to lose weight. 
                    No exercise, no diet, no pain. 
                    Just lifelong freedom, from fat,
                    the Holy Grail of the modern age. 
                    And here it is! 

      Holds it up, an ordinary red & white capsule.

                                    MISS FOSTER (CONT'D)
                    You just take one capsule.

                    One capsule, once a day, for three
                    weeks.  And the fat, as they say...

      ON SCREEN, GRAPHIC, the logo does a little spin, the jingle
      sings: The Fat Just Walks Awaaaaay! 

      CUT TO DONNA, in amongst the audience, as a WOMAN near to
      her pipes up - PENNY CARTER, late 20's, sharp.

                                      PENNY
                    Excuse me, Miss Foster, if I
                    could..?  I'm Penny Carter, Science
                      Correspondent for the Observer  

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    Oh yes.  You've written quite a
                    bit about us already. 

                                      PENNY
                    And I'm not about to stop.  But
                    there's a thousand diet pills on
                    the market, and a thousand conmen
                    stealing people's money.  How do
                    we know the fat isn't going straight
                    into your bank account?
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
                                    MISS FOSTER
                    Penny.  If cynicism burnt up
                    calories, we'd all be thin as rakes. 
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    But if you want the science, then
                    I can oblige...

      She nods up to the PROJECTION BOOTH.

      The projected beam of light flickers, changes.

      The next reel starts up, GRAPHICS showing a pill, and a
      layout of the Human body, with arrows going from the pill,
      to the body, then flowing round the bloodstream.

                                      VOICEOVER
                    The Adipose Capsule is composed of
                      a synthesised mobilising lipase,
                    bound to a large protein molecule. 
                    The mobilising lipase breaks up
                    the triglycerides stored in the
                    adipose cells, which then enter
                    the bloodstream... [etc.]

      But during this, on Donna, watching, suspicious.  And then
      PAN UP to see behind her, THE DOCTOR, in the PROJECTION
      BOOTH WINDOW.  (Not seeing Donna, just watching the screen.)

      CUT TO INT. PROJECTION BOOTH, THE DOCTOR at the window, a
      FILM PROJECTOR whirring away, manned by a BLOKE.  The Doctor
      shows him the psychic paper, keeping his eye on Miss Foster.

      FOSTER steps forward again.  CUT BETWEEN THE DOCTOR & DONNA
      watching, separately.

                                      PENNY
                    But can I ask, how many people
                    have taken the pills, to date?

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    We've already got one million
                    customers within the Greater London
                    area alone.  But from next week,
                    we start rolling out, nationwide. 
                    The future starts here.  And Britain
                    will be thin!

1414INT. SALES CUBICLES - DAY 1

      The sales floor.  Divided into those American-style
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
      cubicles, as functional as possible, like Keanu Reeves's
      office in The Matrix.  Just a desk, a computer, a phone. 

        www.thewriterstale.com
      TRACKING along, passing one SALESPERSON after another, all
      on headsets, all cold-calling the spiel.  'Good morning, I
      represent Adipose Industries...' 'Good morning, I represent
      Adipose Industries...' 'Good morning, I represent...' etc.

      TRACKING TO FIND DONNA, walking in - on edge, cautious,
      armed with a clipboard - she grabs a spare chair, pulls it
      over to a CUBICLE, where CRAIG, 20, is at work, on headset.

      CUT TO the opposite side of the room, THE DOCTOR entering -
      cautious, on edge - he grabs a spare chair, slides it across
      to CLAIRE'S cubicle.  She's 20, on headset.

      he's got a script, and a sample Adipose Industries box at
      his side - a small white cardboard box, full of 21 pills
      in packets, information leaflets, etc.

                    worth of pills, a full information
                    pack, and our special free gift,
                    an Adipose Industries pendant...

      But Donna's taking the pendant out of the box.  Simple
      gold chain with a gold representation of an Adipose capsule.

      CUT TO the Doctor & Claire.

                                      CLAIRE

                    don't give away pens.  Sorry.  No,
                    I can't make an exception, no.

      He's already taken the pendant, holds it up, examines it.

      CU on the gold Adipose capsule. 

      CUT TO Donna & Craig.  He's now taking off his headset, to
      look at her properly, as she puts the pendant in her pocket.

                                      DONNA
                    I'll just keep this for testing.  
                    And I just need a list of your
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
                      customers, can you print it off?

                    Where's the printer..?

                                      CRAIG
                    Just over there, by the door.

      WIDE SHOT, as she pops her head up over the partition. 
      The only face visible among the rows of cubicles.

                                      DONNA
                    Which door, that door?

                    Lovely.

      She pops back down, gone - and in that second -

      - THE DOCTOR pops his head up, far across the room.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And that's the printer, over there?

      And he pops back down -

      - as Donna pops back up, looking towards the printer.

                                      DONNA
                    Does it need a code?  Last place I
                    worked, the printer needed a code.

                                      CRAIG OOV
                    No, I can do that from here.

      And she pops back down -

      - as the Doctor pops back up, looking round.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Has it got paper?

                    Yeah, Jimbo keeps it stocked.

      But the Doctor gives an 'oops!' and ducks down, seeing -

      MISS FOSTER striding in.  With 2 SECURITY GUARDS, her
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
      permanent escort.  She goes to the centre, claps her hands.

                                    MISS FOSTER
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    Everyone!  Excuse me!  If I could
                    have your attention!

      Heads pop up all around the cubicles, some standing, some
      just with eyes over the partitions.  Donna stands up...

      As the Doctor slowly stands up...

      Miss Foster takes a single step forward, just in time to
      completely mask the Doctor from Donna's POV, and vice versa. 

                                    MISS FOSTER (CONT'D)
                    On average, you're each selling
                    forty Adipose packs per day.  It's
                    not enough!  I want one hundred
                    sales, per person, per day, and if
                    not, you'll be replaced.  Cos if
                    anyone's good at trimming the fat,
                    it's me.  Now back to it!

      All heads duck down, Donna sinking back down as -

      Miss Foster clears Donna's previous POV, revealing the
      Doctor, just ducking back down into the cubicle.  To Claire:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Anyway!  If you could just print
                    that off, thanks.

                    Lovely, thanks, see you.

      WIDE SHOT, as she stands, hurries over to the printer -

      The Doctor pops up for a micro-second, about to go -

                    Thanks then -

      - before he can look in Donna's direction, he's pulled
      back down again!  By Claire, holding out a piece of paper.

      And as she swings it open, foreground, and disappears

      And he hurries away, going across to the printer.

      No papers, nothing.  Eh?!  He lifts the photocopier lid,
      checks all round, no sign of them.  Damn.

      CUT TO CLAIRE, as the Doctor reappears.  Big smile.

                    flaps.  They don't just let things
                    in.  They let things out as well.

      little fang.  It's strangely sort of cute.  Like a soft
      toy.  It seems to be waving, little stumpy arms, at Stacy.

      Stacy is just boggling.

      LIVING ROOM, Donna goes to the hallway door, calls up:

                                      DONNA

                    ...yeah.

      FX: the ADIPOSE is mewling at her, a bit like 'mummy!'

                    The Adipose has been witnessed. 
                      Activating full parthenogenesis.

      And in her other hand, she's got a GOLD CAPSULE - she takes
      hold of it, twists it -

      Underneath her trousers, one of her buttocks is now starting
      to move, a shape squirming under the fabric...

      CUT TO DONNA, by the living room door, calling up.

                    hall.

      STACY twisting round to see in the mirror, as...

      FX: an ADIPOSE struggles up over the waistband of the back
      of her trousers!  Mewling!  Free!

      CUT TO Donna, getting a bit concerned now -

                    Have you lived here long?  Stacy?

                    What are you?  What are you?

      But then - oh God - more movement - under her t-shirt,
      more shapes, lots, shifting, her stomach, at her shoulder,
      on her back, on her thigh, writhing under her clothes.

      CUT TO STAIRS, DONNA, now heading up.

      CUT TO BATHROOM, Stacy desperate, now trying the press the
      bumps in her clothing back in to her skin...

      Donna now outside the door, little knock.

                    What is it, what's wrong - ?

      Donna rattles the door, it's locked -

      Inside, Stacy's still struggling with the writhing bumps -

      Donna starts to thump the door.  Bangs it.  Shoves it.

      Then Stacy shudders, lets go of the bumps, screams -

      FX: in a second, she's gone - her whole body divides into
      separate pieces - twenty separate ADIPOSE, plop!, tumbling
      to the floor, in amongst her falling, empty clothes -

      FX: on the FLOOR, in amongst the fallen clothes, a NUMBER
      OF ADIPOSE waddle about, heading for the walls, with one
      still emerging from the clothes.

      Donna hears something, stops shoving, listens...

      A tiny giggling, a scurrying noise, from the bathroom.

      Donna shoves again, shoves hard -

      CU on the bolt, flying off, the door flies open - !

      Donna in the doorway, stares.

      Her POV: Stacy's clothes on the floor.  Then looking up...

      FX: the bathroom window is open.  And just one ADIPOSE
      remains, on the windowsill.  It gives Donna a little wave,

                    Right, we'll do it the hard way.

      Empty.

      Donna terrified.

      THE DOCTOR opens the Access Door, steps out on to the roof. 
      The lights of the city all around.

      But he runs, fast, over to the edge -

      Where there's a WINDOW CLEANER'S CRADLE.  Lovely!  Just
      what he needs.  He starts to sonic the controls.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    - you've got no right to do this! 
                    Let me go!!

      Behind them, through the door they first came through,
      DONNA peeks through a tiny gap.  In pursuit!

        Secretaries' area, dark.  DONNA creeps towards MISS FOSTER'S
      OFFICE - it's got glass interior walls, but with blinds
      drawn, though there's still a glass panel in the door.

      Donna crouches below the glass in the door.  Listens.

      CONTINUES INTERCUT WITH SC.67, MISS FOSTER'S OFFICE.

      MISS FOSTER now behind her desk, facing PENNY.  The GUARDS

      now they stand back, on duty, behind Miss Foster.

      INTERCUT with DONNA listening, crouched low, outside the
      office door; THE DOCTOR crouched low, outside the window.

                      A beautifully fat country.  Believe
                    me, I've travelled a long way to
                    find obesity on this scale.

                          (calmer, strong)
                    Come on then.  Those pills.  Miss
                    Foster.  What are they?

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    You might as well have a scoop. 
                    Since you'll never see it printed. 
                          (holds up a capsule)
                    This... is the spark of life.

                    What's that supposed to mean?

                                    MISS FOSTER
                      Officially, the capsule attracts
                    all the fat cells, and then flushes
                    them away.  Well, it certainly
                    attracts them, that part's true. 
                    But it binds the fat together, and
                      galvanises it, to form a body.

                    I'm surprised you didn't ask about
                    my name.  I chose it well.  Foster,
                    as in foster mother.  And these...
                    are my children.

      She opens the desk drawer, reaches in, plucks out...

      FX: she puts an ADIPOSE on the desk.  It waves.

      ON THE DOCTOR & DONNA ONLY now, frustrated, unable to see.

                    Adipose.  It's called, an Adipose.

      At the same time, the Doctor has to see... so, putting his

      of the office, the Doctor & Donna a few feet further towards
      the back, so there's a clear space between the Doctor &
      Donna, who are directly opposite each other.) 

      The Doctor lifts his head up... looking left, to the desk.

      Donna lifts her head up... looking right, to the desk.

      Then the Doctor looks straight ahead, seeing -

      Donna looks straight ahead, seeing -

      The Doctor!!!!

      Donna!!!??!

      Big long moment, both just boggling, open-mouthed.  Then,
      all shot through the glass, in silence, big gestures:

      The Doctor: Donna???

      The Doctor: but, but, but, why, what, where, when?

      Donna points at him - you!!  I was looking for you!

      The Doctor: me?  What for?

      Donna does a little mime:  I, came here, trouble, read
      about it, internet, I thought, trouble = you!  And this
      place is weird!  Pills!  So I hid.  Back there.  Crept
      along.  Heard this lot.  Looked.  You!  Cos they...

      And on 'they', she gestures and looks towards Miss Foster.

      Who is staring at her.  As are the guards.  Penny, too.

      Donna freezes.  Oops.

      Miss Foster then looks at the Doctor.  Calm:

      SIDE falling, the broken cable whipping downwards, the
      RIGHT HAND SIDE still connected, staying where it is, so
      the whole shebang falls down from the left - ie, the
      horizontal platform tipping to vertical - THE DOCTOR &

      THE DOCTOR slams into the left-hand wall of the cradle -
      the cradle now vertical, and swinging a little - but it
      remains connected on the right-hand-side, so the left-hand-
      wall has become the floor -

      below her - she's clinging to the hanging left-hand-side
      cable.  (There's, say, a spar of metal, formerly part of
      the winch, fixed to the cable, and Donna's actually holding
      on to that; she could never hold on to cable alone.)

                    I've been hacking into this thing

                    It's the Inducer.  We'd planned to

                          (beat, then cheeky)
                    She fancied me.

      MID-SHOT, Miss Foster stops, suspended in the air (IE, NON-
      FX, shot against night sky; she's haloed and backlit by
      PRAC LIGHT).  Calling across the night:

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    I don't think so, Doctor.  And if

                    What, so you can arrest me? 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Just listen!!  I saw the Adiposian
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
                      instructions!  They know it's a

                    any more!

      MID-SHOT, on Miss Foster... as the LIGHT SNAPS OFF! 
      Darkness.  She looks left and right, held in the air for a

      out of the bottom of frame -

      Donna turns to the Doctor, flinches, with the OOV crunch!

      The Doctor puts his arm around her.  So sorry.

      Then both look up, hearing the whine of engines...

124124EXT. ADIPOSE INDUSTRIES - NIGHT 2

      THE DOCTOR & DONNA stroll out.  Exhausted.  Calm.  Way off
      in the distance, there are signs of the disruption - POLICE
      BARRIERS, FLASHING LIGHTS.  An AMBULANCE and PARAMEDICS
      closer to the building (hiding the remains of Miss Foster).

      The Doctor looks at the SONIC PEN, decides naah, chucks it
      away, gets out the SONIC SCREWDRIVER, jams it into his
      GIZMO, points the whole thing up -

      FX: a SMALL BLUE PULSE OF LIGHT flies up, into the sky...

          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
                    Sending a statement to the Shadow

                    I hate being official, brrr.

      PENNY appears.  Staggering.  She is still tied to her chair,
      having to hold it behind her.  Wild-eyed and furious:

                                      PENNY

                    report you!  For madness!

      She runs off towards the distant POLICE, like a lunatic.

                                      DONNA
                    Some people just can't take it.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Nope.

125125EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 2

      The street from sc.50, DONNA running in, realising that
      her car is near the TARDIS, though a fair distance between
      them.  THE DOCTOR is the definition of dubious.

                                      DONNA
                    That's my car!  That's like destiny! 
                    And I've been ready for this, I
                    packed ages ago, just in case -

      And she's opening the boot, hauling out a suitcase, another,
      a carpet bag, a valise, a trolley-thing, two plastic bags -

      She shoves them at the Doctor, piling them up in his arms -

                                      DONNA (CONT'D)
                    - cos I thought, hot weather, cold
                    weather, no weather, he goes
                    anywhere, I've gotta be prepared -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You've got a hatbox.

                                      DONNA

      JUMP CUT TO DONNA dumping her armfuls of stuff by the
        www.thewriterstale.com
      Tardis, THE DOCTOR standing back, still weighed down with
      luggage; so she's in the Tardis doorway, with him facing
      her, the opposite of the end of 3.X.

                                      DONNA (CONT'D)
                    - I don't need injections, do I? 
                    Y'know, like when you go to
                    Cambodia, is there any of that? 
                    Cos my friend Veena went to Bahrain,
                    and... you're not saying very much.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, but it's just...  It's a funny
                    old life, in the Tardis, it's not...

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm not saying that.

                                      DONNA
                    But you asked me.

                          (dumps luggage)
                    But the last time, with Martha,
                    like I said, it got complicated. 
                    And it was all my fault.  I mean...
                          (sighs)
                    I just want a mate.

                    of that nonsense, you're a skinny
                    streak of nothing.  Alien nothing.

                          (smiles)
                    I'd love it.

      She runs towards him, overjoyed -

      And she's gone.  The Doctor stands there for a second,
      looking at the luggage, wondering, what the hell..?  But
      then crucially, he smiles.  Starts picking up the bags.

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 1 - Yellow Amendments - 16/10/07         Page 56.
