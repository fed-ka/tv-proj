CHILDREN scurry across the courtyard as we FIND SARA, 
intact, in the classic parental limbo - waiting for her 
kid after school. A TAP on her shoulder turns her...

KENDRA

KENDRA (38, make-up and slit skirt over-preparing for the

Out on the water, a boat glides by. Sara steps out to the 
railing - in BG, a man speaks on his cell phone... Jack. ZABEL - BETRAYAL - 1/17/13                               7.


Finishing, he puts the phone away, and for a moment, they 
both stand there looking out, unaware of each other, the 
same expression on their faces... TWO ROMANTIC DREAMERS. 
A passing cargo boat BLOWS its SIGNAL WHISTLE, causing 
Sara and Jack to simultaneously turn - so that they find 
themselves FACE TO FACE. Suddenly. A beat...

 thrilled and discomfited - removes the coat. She s

He reaches out for it - his hand accidentally brushes 
against hers. They linger there, touching, a millisecond 
longer than they should. A long look; he takes the coat. 

JACK
Good luck with the show. 

SARA
Good luck diving for wrecks. 

He watches her walk away, wondering what just happened - 
thrown in the way that a quick jolt of joy can throw you.

It takes her aback - his REPRESSED FRUSTRATION. Their

in - VALERIE and VICTOR, 16. Val is pretty, straight and 
sharp-witted. Victor is rugged, edgy, works out too much.

Sara fiddles with her gear. A train lets off passengers - 
she looks the other way, for hers. Raises the camera and 
PANS across the tracks until... she is stopped by a 
 Jack. Instinctively, she CLICKS figure leaning in - it s
the shutter. He calls across the divide - sweet, funny.

They remain there, frozen in a look. She is paralyzed 
into stillness, indecision freezing her. Down the tracks, 
her TRAIN RUMBLES IN. She looks at it, thinking, I can be 
home in two hours. With my husband, my son. On his side, 
he wonders: will she be there when the train goes? 

The train SCREECHES to a stop - its doors SLIDE OPEN. She 
stares into the car - a dilemma, a crisis at her very 
s  know - she core. Why does it feel this way? She doesn t
not sure she cares. The train PULLS AWAY, grinding...


A LONG SHOT - FROM ACROSS THE TRACKS 

The train pulls out - where is she? Still there? Gone? 
Only once the final car has clicked by do we see... SARA, 
still on the platform. She looks across to JACK - holding 
each other in a locked gaze for a long moment, like 
 nothing - and no one - else in the world. Almost there s
like they could stand there forever.

Sara leans against the wall, a million thoughts racing 
through her head. Jack comes back out from inside, holds 
up a room key. She says it plainly, with no judgment. 

SARA
It seems easy for you. 

JACK
Would you like me to cancel it?

He turns back; she reaches out for his arm. Pulls him 
into her. Tenderly and slowly, they KISS. The kiss 
persists, starts to unfold, the way a kiss will...

From inside, Margaret comes out looking for Lou, but 
can't find him. Both he and T.J. are gone, not where she 
left them ten minutes ago. She is worried, checks her 
watch, and tries calling him again on her cell phone.
