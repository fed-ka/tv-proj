And he gave me your number.

MS. NEWBERG 
I have a flat tire.

She exhales impatiently and pulls Hank and Divya aside.

MS. NEWBERG
No, a flat tire.

She opens her fur coat, revealing ONE GIANT PROTRUSION on the 
left side of her chest.  The right side is...flat.

HANK
Oh.

Hank can barely keep a straight face.  Divya sees pure

That s a shame.  But this isn t my
