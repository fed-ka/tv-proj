The place is nearly empty. Manetta is talking to PAUL
VITTI, a dark, intense, intelligent man in his late
forties, and a powerful boss in his own right.
MANETTA
Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of
it capo de tutti capi, and that
was the last time the whole
commission tried to meet -- until
now.
VITTI
(brooding)
I don't know. I don't like it.
What do we need a meeting for?
Let everybody worry about their
own business.
They finish eating.
MANETTA
The '57 meeting was about how we
were going to divide up the whole
country. This meeting is about
how we're gonna survive. You got
'made' guys informing for the
Feds; bosses going to jail;
everybody's dealing drugs; people
are getting whacked without
permission. And on top of
everything, now we got the Chinese
Triads and these crazy Russians to
deal with. Everything's changing.
We need a leader. Someone with
fresh ideas. Someone like you.
It's gonna be a new century, Paul.
We gotta change with the times.
VITTI
What are we gonna get, a fuckin'
web site?
MANETTA
You remember what else happened in
1957, Paul?
VITTI
Yeah, I remember.
MANETTA
When your father died, I promised
him I'd always look out for you.
Come to the meeting.

They get up to leave. Vitti drops some money on the
table. Bodyguards follow them to the door. The waiters
and the owner bow to them as they pass. They are almost
out the door when Vitti hesitates.
VITTI
Wait a second. I'm just gonna
grab a toothpick.
The instant he steps back inside, Manetta and his
bodyguard are struck by an incredible VOLLEY of GUNFIRE,
which BLOWS OUT all the GLASS in the DOOR and WINDOWS.
Vitti's bodyguard, JELLY, grabs him and throws him behind
the counter, shielding him with his body.
Outside, the shooting has stopped and curious bystanders
are looking in the broken windows. Vitti's eyes well up
with tears.

The office is warm, comfortable, and nicely decorated.
CAROLINE

I kept telling him that I needed
room to grow and find myself as a
person. Not just as a woman but
as an independent entity.
BEN SOBOL
her therapist, seems to be listening intently.
CAROLINE
I told him I needed to get in
touch with my uniqueness, but he
couldn't handle that. He said I
was driving him away. Do you

Sobol?

with things ending that's important.
CAROLINE
I just can't believe it's over between
me and Steve. Maybe there's still
hope.
BEN
Well, he did take out a restraining
order against you. I have to be
honest, that's usually not a good
sign.
CAROLINE
But what should I do?
BEN
Well, Caroline, I think the first
thing you have to do...
(voice rising)
... is stop whining about this
pathetic loser! You're a tragedy
queen!
(mocking)
'Steve doesn't respect me. Steve
doesn't love me anymore.' Who gives

are, without a doubt, the most
boring human being I have ever met!
Please, say something interesting

Yeah, what's Caroline's problem?
Your boyfriend's gone, he hates

BEN
Michael! What did I tell you?
You can't listen to my sessions!
It's private stuff.

MICHAEL

cummerbund)
Why do we have to wear rented

BEN

We have to dress up because
Grandpa can't have a good time

uncomfortable.

Forget the tux. Regular clothes.
Ben exits, pulling off the tux shirt.

Michael's room)
Did she say anything about me
getting married again? I think
she could be feeling a little anger
about it.
MICHAEL
Oh, yeah. She really cares. She
says you're intimidated by women

go for these young babes.

Okay. Listen, for two seconds,

I'm just some guy, okay?

NICKY
Yeah.
You're Mr. Vitti.
VITTI
And you know what I'm gonna do to

NICKY
Uh, you're gonna crack me on the

JIMMY

It's a rhetorical question, you

I think you're reacting like this

No. Don't. I'm not going to be
analyzed by someone who up until

Santa. Sorry, but we only have

I can't piss off these big book
stores. If I cancel, they'll
stick me down on the bottom shelf.
That's how they are.

Yeah, that's the word on the

pricks.
DOROTHY

BEN
I'm sorry, but I've been alone
for eight years, now I've finally
met someone I want to spend the
rest of my life with and I would
really like you to meet her
before we get married. You're
going to be her family. I think
it's better she knows that up

Dominic.
JOHNNY BIGS
This is all about the big meeting.
Primo Sindone wants to run the
whole show.
MANGANO
Yeah, but Primo's a boss. He

other families gave their
permission.

If they did, we're heading for one

Talk to Zello and Baldassare.
Find out what you can. We got two

DOCTOR
Well, based on everything, I'd say

wraps the blood pressure cuff around his neck.
VITTI

cuff with the
squeeze-ball)
Listen to me, jerk-off. I had a
mild heart attack and now it's

The Doctor nods vigorously, his eyes bugging out as the
pressure around his neck increases.

If anyone asks you, you never saw

VITTI
I don't care about the car.
BEN
Then what -- ?
VITTI
A friend of mine is having a
problem and he might have to see a
shrink, so I'm going to ask you a
couple questions. Do we sit?
BEN
Whatever makes you comfortable.
Ben starts for his chair, but Vitti sits in it first.
Ben sits on the couch. Vitti adjusts the cuffs of his
shirt, and runs a hand down the crease in his slacks.
VITTI
Okay, the first thing I gotta know
about is privacy. You must hear
a lot of weird shit in here. How
do I know you won't go testifying
-- not testifying -- but, you know,
talking about it to somebody else.
BEN
I won't discuss a patient with
anyone for any reason, unless I

You can't remember what I said two

Why don't you tell me about your
friend?
VITTI
He's a powerful guy. Never had
a problem dealing with things,
you know? Now all of a sudden,
he's falling apart. He cries
for no reason. He's having
trouble sleeping. And then he

can he do to make it stop?
Ben decides to go for it.
BEN
I'm going to go out on a limb
here. I think your friend is you.
VITTI
You -- you -- you -- you have a
gift, my friend. Go on.
BEN
Medication could help, but if you
really want to get to the bottom
of this, you're going to want to
get some kind of therapy.
VITTI

You did something. The load?
Off. Where is it? Don't know.
You're good, Doctor. I'll be in

If I talk to you and it turns me

I got news for you. I'm still

did nothing for me.
BEN
(indignant)
I did nothing? What did you
expect? I saw you for five
minutes. I don't work miracles,
Mr. Vitti. And I'll tell you
something else. I don't appreciate
it when someone breaks into my
hotel room and kidnaps me. I don't
go for that. I have a family and
a life and a serious practice, and
I don't have time for your
bullshit!
(sheepishly)
That got away from me near the

Vitti stares at Ben.
VITTI
I couldn't get it up tonight.
BEN
(stopped cold)
You mean sexually?
VITTI
No, I mean for the big game
against Michigan State. Of course
sexually!
BEN
You flew fifteen hundred miles and
dragged me out of bed in the
middle of the night because you
couldn't get an erection?

Well, one time. Tonight. And

In my business I deal with

mistake about it, Doctor, animals
are very cunning. And they sense
weakness. Right now I'm an
injured animal. It's only a
matter of time before one of the
lions out there catches the scent.
Then I'm dead. That's the way it
is. If you don't understand that,
then you don't understand the life
I live and you don't understand
me.
BEN

Okay.
VITTI
I have until the end of the week

It's impossible. I can't do

To make you a happy, well-adjusted

playing with a couple of puppies.

Ben turns away and starts for the door.

Hey. That's the mouth she kisses

What's the matter with you?
BEN
Okay, okay. Have you been under a

VITTI
You mean like seeing your best
friend murdered? Yeah, I got
stress.
BEN
Well, based on what you told me

Nobody -- and I mean nobody --

All right. I'm here for two more

Of course because of this! You
don't have even the tiniest shred

I feel very angry, you know. Very,

Thumbs up from Ben.

Provano, Federal Bureau of

Can you explain these photographs,
Doctor Sobol?

I'm a psychotherapist.
Paul
Vitti is my patient.
LAURA
Was your patient.
BEN
Right.
Was.
That's what I meant.
LAURA
But not like a real patient.
BEN
Right.
PROVANO
So why did he send you that
fountain?
BEN
That was a gift to celebrate the
completion of his therapy. We
got our television from an
agoraphobic, so it's not that
unusual -- you know, maybe you
should discuss this with my
attorney.
LAURA
Yeah, maybe you should.

AGENT RICCI
It's your house.
LAURA
Too bad you didn't remember that

of every major crime family in the
United States are going to meet
together somewhere in the New York
area.
Ben nods, finally understanding Vitti's two week deadline.

major bloodbath. Has he mentioned
anything about it to you?

stands out in a conversation.
AGENT STEADMAN
(gathering photos)
You could really help us out by
supplying information about that
meeting.
BEN
And if I don't?
AGENT STEADMAN
If you don't, I will personally
make your life a living hell. I
want you to think about that and
call me at this number when you
change your mind.
BEN
You mean if I change my mind.
AGENT STEADMAN
I mean when.
LAURA

Okay. Guess what, fellas?
You don't scare me.
BEN
Laura --
LAURA
Sit down!
(to the Agents)
There's going to be a bloodbath.
Oh, yeah. Only it's going to be
between you and me. You think you
can break into our home and
intimidate us? That ain't the

he and Paul Vitti talked about is

Right now, we're the only ones who

on the street -- what then? Who
knows what you've been saying in
there?
VITTI
It's none of anybody's business
what I say in there.
MASIELLO
Paul, I beg to differ. If you're
doing this to establish some kind
of insanity defense later, that's
one thing. But everybody's gonna
think you're falling apart, and
that ain't good. They'll take it
as a sign of weakness, and that
makes us all vulnerable. Sindone
would take over everything.
VITTI
So what do you want me to do?
MASIELLO
It's time to end it.
VITTI
What do you mean, end it?
MASIELLO
Get rid of this shrink.
He knows
too much already.
VITTI
You want me to whack my doctor?
MASIELLO
If you don't do it, somebody else
will. It's the only way.

Don't buy me a Rolex.

Ben stops cold. A casket sits in front of the altar.
A funeral service is in progress.
VITTI
Tommy Angels. We grew up together.
Worked for a crew out of Jersey
City.
BEN
How did he die?
VITTI
He was on his way to talk to a
federal prosecutor. Got hit by
a truck -- twice.
BEN
Do I need to know that? I'm

An older woman kisses Vitti's hand, then both his cheeks.
Vitti whispers a few words to her, then she kisses Ben's
hand and moves on. More old ladies kiss their hands as
they walk by.
VITTI
You're losing it, Doc.
You may

This is serious, Doc. If he
doesn't make this meeting, they'll
kill him for sure.
BEN
Can't someone else in the family go
for him? Tommy the Tongue? Louie
the Lip? What about you? You go?
JELLY
That would work except for one
little detail. I'm a fucking
moron. I'm known for it.
(a beat)
You have to go.
BEN
Me?
You must be a moron.

JELLY
Hey!
Watch that.
BEN
You just said it yourself.
JELLY
It's different when I say it.
When you say it, it sounds very
negative.
BEN
I'm sorry, Jelly, but I'm not going.
I'm not on the payroll anymore, so
forget about it. My wife is waiting --
He turns to go back into the hotel.
JELLY
Doc.
Ben feels a gun pressed against his back.
BEN
You can't shoot me, Jelly.
JELLY
Correction. Mr. Vitti couldn't
shoot you. But here's something
about me you should know. I never
got married, Doctor Sobol. I
don't have a hobby. I never got a
dog or a cat. I don't even have a
goldfish. I live for one reason
only, and that's to serve Mr. Paul
Vitti. He's what I'm thinking about
when I wake up, and he's what I'm
thinking about when I close my eyes
to sleep. If he told me to jump off
a tall building, not only would I do
it, I would hope to survive so I could
do it again and again until he told me
to stop. This is all I know. This is
all I got. So please don't think I
won't kill you, because I'd hate for
your last thought to be a wrong one.
You're going to that meeting.

Ben is in the back with Jelly and Jimmy. One of their
crew, IRON MIKE, is driving. Ben is putting on a suit
of Jimmy's. He looks very anxious.
JIMMY
(his shoulder bandaged)
Just remember. That's a fuckin'
$1200 Valentino suit. You spill
anything on it, I'll mess you up
good.
JELLY
Shut up. You're making him
nervous. If he gets nervous and
fucks up, they'll kill him for
sure.
(to Ben)
Let's go over it again.
BEN
This is insane.
JELLY
Mr. Vitti's been detained,
apologies all around, blah, blah,
blah. Then you say you're the new
consigliere, and you're prepared
to speak for Mr. Vitti.
BEN
Then what?
JELLY
Then you just keep your mouth
shut, and hope nobody asks you
nothin'.
JIMMY
Boy, this is some fuckin' plan.
JELLY
Shut up.
(to Ben)
If you have to talk, just be
vague. Can you do that?
BEN
I'm a psychologist.
Believe me, I
can be vague.

Vitti is lying on the bed staring at the ceiling. Marie
is stroking his forehead. Then he looks over and sees
Anthony sitting in a chair at the foot of the bed,
watching him with concern.
VITTI
Shouldn't you be outside playing
or something?
ANTHONY
No, it's all right.
VITTI
How long you gonna sit there?
ANTHONY
(shrugs)
How long you gonna lay there?
Vitti smiles.

Ben, Jelly, and Jimmy enter a garage the size of a small
airplane hangar. The floor has been cleared and long
tables set up to form a square in the middle of the room.
Wiseguys with shotguns patrol the catwalks above the floor
and soldiers are posted at all the doors.
BEN
(sotto voce)
I can't do this. I'm telling you,
I cannot do this.
JELLY
Don't fucking whine! Whining's a
dead giveaway. Come on! You're
the consigliere, for Chrissake.

Around the tables sit forty or fifty of the biggest
gangsters in the world. A few captains stand around the
perimeter, ready to serve their bosses.
BEN
These are the bosses? That one
looks like my Uncle Max.
Jelly steers Ben to an empty seat next to Carlo Mangano.
MANGANO
(surprised)
What's goin' on? Where's Vitti?
JELLY
On his way.
Don't worry.
Mangano eyes Ben with contempt.
MANGANO
What's he doin' here?
JELLY
He's -- it's okay. Forget about
it.
MANGANO
Forget about it? What the hell is
that?
Seated directly across the room from Ben is Primo
Sindone. He stares hard at Ben, trying to place him,
then leans over to Moony, his consigliere.
SINDONE
Who's the guy with Jelly?
MOONY
I don't know.
Ben looks away nervously.
BEN
(to Jelly, borderline
hysterical)
I can't do this.
He starts to get up but Jelly pulls him back down.
Moony stands up and gets everyone's attention.

MOONY
All right, gentlemen. I think we
better start. We have a big
agenda, so for now let's stick to
the big issues. And it would help
if you identify yourselves when
you speak, since we don't all know
each other, and we didn't think
anybody would be into wearing any
fucking name tags.
Laughter around the table.
Sindone stands up and looks straight at Ben.
SINDONE
I'm Primo Sindone. They call me
Sonny Long. It's good to see so
many of the old faces here, and to
welcome the new ones from all over
the country. I see Frank Zello,
and Joe Baldassare, but I'm a
little disappointed to see that
the head of our other New York
family isn't here today. All I
see is his man Jelly and some
sawed-off little prick nobody
knows.
Jelly looks at Ben, waiting for him to speak, but Ben
just sits, frozen, looking down at his hands.
JELLY
(stands up, rattled)
Yeah, well, the thing is Mr. Vitti
has been detained and he sends his
apologies for -- being detained --
and he apologizes for his --
detainment.
SINDONE
Detained? What kind of bullshit
is that? What's more important
than this? As the host of this
meeting, I take his not being here
as a sign of disrespect to me and
to all these other men, too, who
came a long way to be here.
JELLY
Mr. Vitti meant no disrespect.
The thing is, he's not feeling
well. He's sick and he -- didn't
feel well --

Ben rises and slaps Jelly hard across the face.
BEN
(quietly)
Jelly! We don't ever discuss Mr.
Vitti's health outside the family.
You know better.
Jelly is stunned.
The bosses murmur.
SINDONE
All right, who is this guy and
what the fuck is he doing here?
BEN
In answer to your first question,
my name is Ben Sobol --
(off Sindone's
look)
-- leone. Sobboleone. They call
me -- 'The doctor.' As for your
second question. I'm here
representing Paul Vitti. As his
conser -- conghili --
JELLY
(prompting)
Consigliere --
BEN
(slaps him again)
Don't you ever correct me again!
As his consigliere, I'm intimately
involved in all aspects of the
family business and I'm prepared
to speak for Mr. Vitti on all
matters.
SINDONE
Okay, Doctor, then let's get down
to business. Everybody knows
there's been this thing between me
and Paul Vitti for a long time.
BEN
Which thing are you talking about?
The first thing or the second
thing?
SINDONE
What second thing? I only know
one thing.
(CONTINUED)

BEN
Well, I don't see how we can
discuss the first thing without
bringing up the second thing.
Didn't you talk to the guy?
He tugs meaningfully on his earlobe.
SINDONE
What guy?
BEN
The guy with the thing.
SINDONE
What thing? What the fuck are you
talking about?
BEN
How should I know? You brought it
up.
(gestures helplessly
to the others)
This is the whole problem. You
can't have an intelligent
conversation with the man.
SINDONE
How about if I just break your
fuckin' neck? What do you think
of that?
BEN
It's not important what I think.
What do you think?
SINDONE
What do I think? I think it's a
good idea! Why would I say it if
I didn't think it was good?
BEN
I don't know.
Why would you?
SINDONE
(frustrated)
I wouldn't! That's what I'm
saying!
BEN
Have you always had a problem
dealing with your anger?

SINDONSINDONE

I don't know what the fuck you're
talking about!
BEN
See, you're angry again. Do you
feel you have to get angry to be
heard?
Sindone turns to a couple of other bosses, FRANK ZELLO
and JOE BALDASSARE.
SINDONE
What's he talking about?
ZELLO
I don't know. But you do have a
tendency to get angry a lot.
BALDASSARE
I agree, Primo.
SINDONE
I'm trying to talk about Vitti!
Why are we talking about me?
BEN
Interesting. Do you feel you're
not worthy enough to be talked
about?
SINDONE
What does that mean?
BEN
What do you think it means?
SINDONE
Fuck you!
ZELLO
Primo, calm down.

BEN
Could you pass the fruit, please?
SINDONE
That's it!
You're a dead man!
Sindone whips out a pistol and points it at Ben, but just
as he's about to shoot --
VITTI (O.S.)
Primo!
All eyes turn.

PAUL VITTI

He's standing there, staring at Sindone, cool, clear, and
unafraid. He looks like a king. The room goes silent.
Vitti looks around the table, nods, and crosses to Ben.
Jelly gets up to greet him.
VITTI
(quietly, to Jelly)
Wait outside with the car running.
Jelly nods and exits.
BEN
What are you doing here?
VITTI
Saving your ass. Sit down.
I'll
take it from here.
Ben sits, greatly relieved.
VITTI
(to the group)
I'm Paul Vitti. I'm sorry I was
late. Those of you who know me
will know I meant no disrespect.
If it's all right with you,
there's something I'd like to say,
then I'll leave you to your
business.
Ben looks at Vitti and sees a kind of serenity and
clarity he's never seen before.

VITTI
About two and a half weeks ago,
somebody killed my friend, Dominic
Manetta.
He looks straight at Sindone.
SINDONE
Don't look at me. Everybody knows
you whacked him so you could take
over everything.
VITTI
What I really came here to say is
that I've come to a very important
decision in my life. I want out.
A great murmur of surprise sweeps around the room.
Ben
looks at him proudly.
VITTI
I'm going away for a while, but I
will respect the oath I took the
day I was made, and whatever I
know about anyone else's business,
I take with me to the grave. You
have my word.
A negative buzz among the bosses.
VITTI
As for my own organization, I know
Carlo Mangano would like to be the
new boss.
Mangano smiles gratefully.
MANGANO
Thank you, Paul.
VITTI
That's why he betrayed Dominic and
me to our enemies and sent his own
man to kill me in Miami.
Mangano is stunned.
VITTI
But I leave it to my people to
deal with that and choose their
own boss. And even though it's my
right, I won't take revenge,
mostly because I'm in a good place
mentally and feeling good about me.

ZELLO
(perplexed)
I don't know, Paul. I can see
where some people might have a
problem with this.
VITTI
I realize that, so as an extra
token of good faith between us,
I've taken the liberty of writing
down everything I know and putting
it in a safe deposit box in case
anything happens to me or my
family.
There's a long tense silence while the other bosses
consider all this. Then, finally --
ZELLO
I don't know what anybody else
thinks, but I say good luck and
God bless, Paul.
BALDASSARE
Good luck, Paul. Salut.
They all raise their glasses and toast Vitti.
Ben raises
his glass to Vitti and drinks.
BEN

Well done.

I don't think my mother really
listens when I talk. She never

VITTI
And how does that make you feel?
DONNY
It makes me feel angry.
VITTI
I'll bet you feel hurt, too, don't
you?
DONNY
(suddenly vulnerable)
Yes, I do.
BEN
Paul, what would you say about
what Donny's feeling?
VITTI
Donny, when you're thirsty, you
don't go to the wall -- you go to
the well. You know what I'm
saying? Your mother may never be
able to listen to you, but you
have friends here who will.
Okay?
Ben is proud of Vitti's new sensitivity.
BEN
And be patient, Donny. Most
people's problems take months,
sometimes years to resolve.

I'm doing twenty-five to life.

There were guys lined up from
Canarsie to Atlantic City who
wanted to whack that bastard.
BEN
Okay, just checking.
VITTI
You know, Doc, I don't think I
ever thanked you properly for
curing me.

We don't say 'cured.' We say you
