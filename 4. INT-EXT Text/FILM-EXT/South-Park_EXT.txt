Birds fly into the air, TOWNSPEOPLE smile to each other as
they walk by.
It is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off
from, the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'.
A little eight year old boy walks happily down the street. He
is STAN MARSH, a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes
and a strong chin. As he walks, he sings a happy song.
STAN
I'm going to the movies
To see the brighter side of life!
I'm going to the movie
Everything's gonna be alright!
Forget all my troubles
Put my own life on hold
Let a studio tell me
how I should view the world
Where everything works out
I love it that way
I'm going to the movies
The movies today!
Stan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house.
Kenny opens the door to find Stan.
STAN
Kenny! The Terrance and Phillip movie is
out! You wanna come?!
Stan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping. It's an ad for the new
Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'. Kenny's eyes
light up.
KENNY
Mph rmph rm, rmph!
Kenny walks away with Stan. His mother comes out after him.
KENNY'S MOTHER
Kenny! Where're you going?
KENNY
Mph mprh mprh rm!
KENNY'S MOTHER
What do you mean you don't want to go to
church?
KENNY
Mrmph, rmph rmph rm rmph.
Kenny and Stan walk down the street.
KENNY'S MOTHER
Well fine, go ahead and miss church!! And
then when you die and go to hell you can
ANSWER TO SATAN!!
Dramatic MUSIC STING. Kenny stops, thinks for a minute... And
then walks off with Stan anyway.
Stan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the
happy beat.
TOM, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his
Rhinoplasty office.
TOM
Say, where are you boys going?
STAN
We're going to the movies!
To see the brighter side of life!
Where everyone is beautiful
And have their hair combed just
right!
KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph rm!
Mph rm rmph rm!
Mprh rm rmph rm rm
Rmph rm rmph rm rmph!
TOM
Have fun you rascals!
Kenny and Stan knock at the door.
A handsome eight year old Semite, KYLE, answers the door.
KYLE
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go
to church, Kenny?
STAN
Kyle, check it out.
Kenny holds up the newspaper clipping.
KYLE
OH MY GOD, DUDE!!!
Kyle slips on his coat and heads out the door. But just then,
Kyle's little brother, IKE, a two year old adopted Canadian
boy bounces up next to him.
KYLE
No, Ike! You can't come with me!
Kyle's MOTHER, a big fat bitch, comes to the door and yells.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, you take your little brother out to
play with you!
KYLE
Aw, ma!!
KYLE'S MOTHER
Do as I say, Kyle!
Kyle's mother closes the door.
KYLE
Damn it!!
Now the three boys, and little Ike, merrily strut down the
street and sing in unison.
BOYS
We're going to the movies
To see the better side of life
Where something interesting happens
Every day and night!
KYLE
In movies we can pretend
That love is real
and good always wins-
STAN
We can even make believe marriages
last!
A HOMELESS guy is lying in the alley.
HOMELESS GUY
Spare a dollar? Spare a dollar?
Stan walks by and throws a dollar at him. The homeless guy
suddenly jumps up.
HOMELESS GUY
I'm going to the movies!
To see the brighter side of life!
I'm going to the movies
Everything's gonna be alright!
Forget my troubles
Put my own life on hold
Let a studio tell me
how to view the world!
KYLE
Let's go get fat ass!
This house looks just like all the others.
Now all four boys are merrily walking down the street and
singing.
BOYS
We're going to the movies
To see the better side of life!
CARTMAN
Maybe there'll be pirates!
Or a whole city burnin'!
Maybe we'll see a monster
Or, better yet, Uma Thurman!
BOYS
We're going to the movies!
Everything's gonna be okay!
The boys skip out of frame.
The movie theatre is nestled neatly between two other South
Park buildings.
The boys walk up to the geeky, teenage TICKET GUY.
BOYS
Going to the movies!
The movies today!!!!!
STAN
Can I get five tickets to Terrance and
Phillip Asses of Fire, please?
TICKET GUY
No.
Suddenly, all the happy music that has permeated the film
comes to an ABRUPT HALT.
The boys look confused.
KYLE
What'dya mean, no?
TICKET GUY
Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire is
rated 'R'. You kids can't get in.
The boys look shocked. They just stand there, in silence.
CARTMAN
The hell we can't! My money is just as
good as any white person's!
TICKET GUY
You have to be accompanied by a parent or
guardian.
KYLE
But why?
TICKET GUY
Because this movie has naughty language,
and it might make you kids start using
bad words.
CARTMAN
Listen you son of a bitch, if you don't
let us in to see this movie I'm gonna
kick you square in the nuts.
TICKET GUY
Sorry, Charlie.
KYLE
Damn it!
TICKET GUY
Next, please?
A few TEENAGERS walk up to get their tickets. The boys step
aside.
STAN
This is terrible! This can't be
happening!!
KYLE
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
CARTMAN
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that
good anyway.
KYLE
Cartman! What the hell are you talking
about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
CARTMAN
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it
probably can't sustain itself over ninety
minutes.
IKE
Poo baba!
STAN
Wait! I've got an idea!
The old Homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the
Ticket Guy with the boys.
HOMELESS GUY
Uh, hi. I want five tickets to Terrance
and Phillip Asses of Fire.
TICKET GUY
You realize this movie is rated R? It may
not be appropriate for your little ones.
HOMELESS GUY
Oh.
(Turning to boys)
Hey, he says this movie isn't appropriate
for you.
STAN
(Whispering)
Look, homeless guy, if you don't want to
buy us tickets, and NOT get your ten
bucks and NOT go buy yourself a bottle of
Vodka and not forget about how miserable
your life is and not stop the voices in
your head then go right ahead.
HOMELESS GUY
Five tickets please.
The Ticket guy suspiciously hands them over.
The boys walk out of the theatre with glazed eyes and wide
smiles.
KYLE
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
CARTMAN
You bet your fucking ass it was!
STAN
Fuck, dude, I wanna be just like Terrance
and Phillip!
TICKET GUY
Hey wait a minute... Where's your
guardian?
STAN
Huh?
TICKET GUY
I knew it! You PAID a homeless guy to get
you in, didn't you!
The boys think a second.
CARTMAN
Suck my balls.
KYLE
Yeah,
(Singing)
Shut your fucking face,
Unclefucka!!
The boys walk away, merrily. The ticket guy is in shock.
TICKET GUY
Oh oh, I'm in trouble.
BOYS
(Singing, fading off)
You're an asslicking, ball sucking
Unclefucka!!
All the children of South Park are gathered at the pond for
ice skating.
The scene is reminiscent of the skating scene from the
Charlie Brown Christmas special.
Delicate snowflakes fall, children laugh and skate, and
joyous music plays.
The boys walk up to the pond.
CLYDE
Hey, where have you guys been all day?
STAN
Oh, nowhere... We just went out to go see
the TERRANCE AND PHILLIP MOVIE!
All the kids gasp! Dramatic MUSIC STING.
BEBE
You saw it?!
CLYDE
How'd you get in?!
Suddenly, all the kids are gathered around the boys. They're
like celebrities.
CARTMAN
Hey! Stop crowding us you shitfaced
cockmasters!
All the kids stop, wide eyed. As if they've just hear the
voice of God.
KIDS
Wowwww...
STAN
Yeah, you're all a bunch of ass ramming
unclefuckers.
KIDS
Ooooohhh!!!
CLYDE
(To another kid)
We HAVE to see this movie, dude.
The other kids nod.
CARTMAN
Hey Stan, tell 'em about when Terrance
called Phillip a testicle shitting rectal
wart! Stan? Stan?
But Stan is elsewhere, because out on the ice, skating
gracefully, is little eight year old WENDY TESTABURGER.
The heavens part, a CHOIR OF ANGELS sing, as Wendy skates
around and around, performing a series of impossible Triple
Lutzes, Sowcows and what-have-you-not's.
All the animals of the forest -- deer, birds, bunnies -- all
stop to admire her.
Stan's smile grows wider and wider. Kyle turns to see what
he's looking at.
STAN
Thank my lucky stars
Here before me now
Is everything I'd ever hoped for
Knew it in a word
Saw it in a glance
The only thing I think I'd die
for...
KYLE
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that
fucking song again.
ANGLE - WENDY
Spinning and soaring in slo-mo.
Effortlessly covering every
inch of the pond with her ballet maneuvers.
Stan is slack-jawed.
STAN
I can't stop now
My heart's awake
I pray her arms
my arms to take
So this is why I'm ali-
Wendy finishes her routine with a triumphant Hamill-camel
landing right in front of Stan and spraying ice in his face
and abruptly ending his song.
WENDY
Hi, Stan!
Stan vomits profusely all over himself.
WENDY
Ew! Gross!
Just then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in Stan's
face. His name is GREGORY, and he is a very handsome eight
year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt. He
speaks with a rich English accent.
GREGORY
Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly
brush.
Stan looks at Gregory.
STAN
Who are you, kid?
GREGORY
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's
counter-cousin for some time.
WENDY
Want to skate with us?
GREGORY
We've been skating all morning. And
laughing and talking of memories past.
Gregory skates away. Stan looks stunned. Finally, he tries to
get Wendy's attention.
STAN
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
WENDY
That's nice, Stan.
Wendy skates after Gregory. Stan looks completely rejected.
KYLE
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new
guy?
STAN
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
Meanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around
Cartman.
CARTMAN
Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip
movie. Who wants to touch me?
I said,
"Who wants to touch me?!"
A small boy steps forward and tentatively touches Cartman's
arm.
SMALL BOY
Oooooh...
Establishing shot of the little town of South Park which
consists of four buildings. The sun rises in the background.
It's a brand new day.
The elementary school is nestled peacefully between two
mountain peaks.
A happy birthday party is going on is some kids backyard. A
clown is entertaining everyone.
CLOWN
Hey kids, how would you like to see some
magic tricks?!
KIDS
FUCK YOU!!
The clown looks startled.
CLOWN
Huh?
CHILD
Yeah, and fuck your stupid little red
nose.
CHILD 2
Yeah, and fuck your yellow hair. And fuck
your gay pants.
PAN OVER to again find the midget reporter. He now has a
graphic of a record chart next to him.
Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI
And the devastating impact of the
Canadian phenomenon is Terrance and
Phillip's new hit song, "Shut Your
Fucking Face, Unclefucka" which has
climbed the charts with a bullet --
We see a clip from the video, "Unclefucka."
The video has Terrance and Phillip dressed like Mase and
Puffy in that video they did in Vegas.
They wear shiny
bright jumpsuits and lunge at the fish-eye lens of the
camera.
TERRANCE & PHILLIP
(Singing)
Shut your fucking face!
Unclefucka!!
The boys walk out happily.
KYLE
Man, that movie gets better every time I
see it!
CARTMAN
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part
about lighting farts is bullshit. You
can't do that.
KENNY
Mph rmpmh rm.
CARTMAN
No way.
STAN
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
WENDY
Stan... I think you and I need some time
apart.
STAN
WHAT?!
CARTMAN
Oh shit.
WENDY
It's just... It's obvious that we don't
have a whole lot in common anymore. I
need somebody who's... a little deeper.
STAN
But Wendy, I can go-
Wendy places her little gloved hand over Stan's mouth.
WENDY
No. Don't speak. You'll only make things
more annoying. Goodbye, Stan.
And just like that, Wendy is gone. Stan looks almost ready to
cry.
Kyle walks up behind Stan.
KYLE
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance
and Phillip is funny can fuck off
anyways.
STAN
(Insincere)
Yeah...
The boys walk off.
KENNY
Mph rmph rm!!
CARTMAN
No you can't Kenny!
KENNY
Mph rm rmph!!
CARTMAN
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED
DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
KENNY
Mph mm!
Kenny pulls out a book of matches.
He strikes a match and holds it under his ass.
After a few seconds Kenny farts, and there is a little flame.
Suddenly, the flames catch and Kenny starts burning alive.
KENNY
MMMPMMPH!!! MGMFEODFO!!!
Kenny runs around, and finally falls to the ground, still
burning.
STAN
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
KYLE
YOU BASTARD!!
Cartman looks shocked.
CARTMAN
Wow, I guess you CAN do that!
The doors to the hospital swing open, and the parents march
out into the street, singing in unison as they go.
PARENTS
(Singing)
Something must be done!
Something's gotta give!
This world has become a bitch in
which
we have no desire to live!
Cars come screeching to a halt as the parents sing in the
middle of the road. People start honking their horns in
frustration.
KENNY'S MOTHER
My boy could have become a doctor
Or a lawyer rich and true
Instead he burned up like a piggy
on a bar-b-que!
KYLE'S MOTHER
We will fight for children's rights
in memory of your son!
PARENTS
We can't just stand here singing!
Something must be done!
Cars are now smashing into each other, and flying off the
road to people's deaths, as the music number has taken over
the busy intersection.
PARENTS
We've pushed and pushed it to the
edge
And now the time has come!
Something's gotta change!
It's time to buy a gun!
We can't just stand here singing
No we can't just stand here singing
No we can't just stand here
singing!
Something must be done!!!
A few more cars careen off and explode into flames as if
ending the song with a borage of fireworks.
Kenny's body is floating through a great void. A PEACEFUL
SONG plays as he soars upwards to the heavens.
*note - except for Kenny's little construction paper body,
this entire sequence should be done in 3D CGI.
Ahead of him, Kenny can see a great white light. It appears
warm and inviting.
Now Kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down
in the heavens. He reaches out to touch them.
Kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and
bobbing breasts. The music crescendos as Kenny gets almost
close enough to the light to touch it.
Just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up. 'Access Denied'.
Suddenly, Kenny goes spiraling downward. The song changes to
a MINISTRY type number as Kenny's surroundings start to
become darker and more twisted.
Kenny's hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel, filled
with flames and heat.
KENNY
Mph rmph rm!
Burning souls SCREAM and CRY all around Kenny, as his body
plunges into what is now obviously the depths of hell.
Kenny passes images of Hitler, John Wayne Gacy, hunger and
disease as he continues through the twisting tunnel.
He then passes images of Jimmy Stewart and Gandhi. All of
whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity.
The same ticket guy from before is at the ticket booth. The
marquee still reads 'Terrance and Phillip' but a huge sticker
has been placed over it that reads 'banned'.
The boys stand underneath the marquee looking baffled.
STAN
How can they do this?
KYLE
It isn't fair!
CARTMAN
Well, Terrance and Phillip are on Conan
O'Brian tonight, we could at least go
watch that.
The boys hang their heads and walks away.
The ticket guy suddenly hears a bunch of commotion. He sees a
mob of angry mothers, led by Kyle's mother.
KYLE'S MOTHER
THIS must be him, officer! This is the
scum that sold R rated tickets to
children!
TICKET GUY
What?! Jesus Christ, I didn't mean to!
Barbrady slaps handcuffs on the freaked out teen.
OFFICER BARBRADY
You can explain downtown!
TICKET GUY
(Getting dragged away)
Oh shit! Hey it's not MY fault! You
should arrest those pervert Canadians!
KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh we will, Mr. Scumbag... We will...
Establishing.
Establishing shot.
Establishing shot of the small Betty Fordesque building.
A news reporter stands in front of the Supreme Court. All
around him are protestors, with signs that say CANADA NO! and
CAN'TADA! Still others hold signs with Kenny on them.
NEWS REPORTER
Tom I'm standing in front of the U.S.
Supreme Court where the most important
trial of the - day - is happening.
Thousands of people have shown up from
all over the country to show their
outrage and disgust at Canada. Joining me
now is Mrs. McKormick, mother of the poor
little boy who was killed by the
Canadians.
Kenny's mother steps into frame. She is wearing a shirt with
Kenny's picture on it. Written on the T-shirt is 'Have you
seen my son? No, you haven't. He's dead.'
NEWS REPORTER
Mrs. McKormick, you must really hate the
Canadians.
KENNY'S MOTHER
Yes, yes I do, Tom.
NEWS REPORTER
Did you ever think you would see the day
when thousands of people were wearing
your son Kenny on T-shirts?
KENNY'S MOTHER
No I didn't. But if any of you would like
one they're 14.95. Available in blue or
white.
The reporter thinks for a second, and then turns back to the
camera.
NEWS REPORTER
Well, we can only imagine the intense,
vehement trial that is going on inside.
School is now Naziesque. A military drum echoes in the
distance.
Stan and Kyle are walking down South Park Avenue. Stan is
reading out of a huge book.
KYLE
Does it say what the clitoris is?
STAN
All it says is that it's above the
vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
KYLE
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
Stan and Kyle walk into the middle of town, where a HUGE
bonfire of Terrance and Phillip videos, posters, and Canadian
items like syrup and hockey sticks are burning away.
The soldiers throw Stan's book on top of the pile, and it
starts to burn.
Stan and Kyle walk up to where Cartman is standing.
STAN
What is this?
CARTMAN
They're burning all the Canadian stuff
cause of the war.
STAN
That book wasn't Canadian!
Clyde, one of the kids from school, throws his Terrance and
Phillip dolls into the burning mass.
Kyle stops him on his way back.
KYLE
Dude, don't you like Terrance and Phillip
anymore?
CLYDE
Of course not! We're at war! My daddy
says I HATE Canadians now!
More kids line up to burn their Terrance and Phillip stuff.
Several random mothers from M.A.C. are standing in front of
the bonfire with anti-Canadian signs and T-shirts. The boys'
parents aren't around, but another MAC mother is leading the
charge.
MAC MOTHER
THAT'S IT! BURN EVERYTHING CANADIAN!!!
MAKE OUR COUNTRY DECENT AGAIN FOR OUR
CHILDREN!!!
A townsperson throws Alanis Morisette albums into the fire.
Another townsperson runs up and throws in a bag of Cheesy
Poofs.
CARTMAN
NNOOOO!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! OH, WHY
GOD, WHY?!
Cartman falls to his knees and cries as the Cheesy Poofs burn
away.
CARTMAN
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle.
She's such a bitch-
(BBBZAATT!!)
AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
KYLE
And she's getting worse...
STAN
Dude... Isn't that your brother?
Kyle looks to where a group of big, mean FIFTH GRADERS have
encircled Ike.
FIFTH GRADER
Why don't you go back to your own
country, CANADIAN!
FIFTH GRADER 2
Yeah, go eat some potatoes and ride
donkeys!
IKE
Eee todo ba!
Kyle's eyes grow wide. He dashes over.
KYLE
Hey! Leave him alone!
FIFTH GRADER
It's just a smelly Canadian. They're like
rats.
KYLE
He's my brother!
FIFTH GRADER
You don't look Canadian.
KYLE
He's adopted!
Kyle picks his brother up and tries to protect him.
FIFTH GRADER
Well you better get his beady eyed
Canadian ass out of America before my
daddy finds him!!
The boys watch in horror as the fifth graders run over and
throw more Canadian items into the fire.
KYLE
It's only a matter of time before my mom
has HIM burned too!
STAN
What has the world come to? This is
horrible. We're locked up, burning books,
hating other people-
CARTMAN
-no Cheesy Poofs.
STAN
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is
happening?
DRAMATIC MUSIC begins.
KYLE
I don't know. But it has gone far enough!
I'm sick of it!
(Singing)
Something must be done!
Change has got to come around!
They're taking all our laughter
and burning it to the ground!
Can't you see what this is leading
to?
A world of chains and ties and
glue!
We have to fight before they've
taken every one!
Something must be done!
STAN
I agree! The only way to save our future
is to unite and fight!
(Singing)
Something must be done!
We must take action fast!
My parents have gotten so strict
they forgot they were children in
the past!
CARTMAN
And my mom has become so bu-sy
that she's raising heck and
ignoring me
I agree that there is now a battle
to be won!
Something must be done!
STAN
But what are we going to do against this
entire army?
KYLE
We've gotta get the word out. We'll get
on my dad's computer and use the
internet! Come on you guys!
The boys proudly head down the street.
BOYS
Something must be done!
Something's gotta give!
This world has become a bitch in
which
we have no desire to live!
(*note- cartman gets shocked again on 'bitch')
BOYS
We've pushed it to the edge
And now the time has come!
Something's gotta change!
Something must be done!
Something must be done!!!
Establishing.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
And so the draft will begin tomorrow, as
more and more troops are needed to fight
the Canadian forces...
A dim light is all that is visible from inside the small
building.
The MAC Mothers are on a stage, preparing two electric
chairs.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Something must be done!
Tomorrow it will be!
We're going to execute this threat
to our democracy!
All the mothers join in as they decorate the chairs with
American flags. Kenny's mother is counting money she has made
from selling t-shirts.
M.A.C. MOTHERS
And after that our kids will be
safe from all the Canadian scum!
The time is now the time is here
Tomorrow something will be done!
The song still CONTINUES as we
CUT TO:
Satan stands on his veranda.
SATAN
I want to be part of that world!
But if only I had the strength to
go without HIM...
If only I had the strength to leave
him behind...
Get on with my life in that
world...
Start over as part of that world...
CUT TO:
The kids are all gathered together, finishing their song.
One kid grabs a large flag and starts swirling it around.
KIDS
Let it echo through the night!
Let it reach the ears of everyone!
Though we die
La Resistance lives on!
Though we die
La Resistance lives onnnn!!!!!
Ah- AHHHH!!!
FADE OUT.
All the South Park men are in the rank and file marching down
the street.
OFFICER
(Singing)
I don't know but I've been told-
SOLDIERS
I DON'T KNOW BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD!
They pass Kyle's house.
Tents and makeshift buildings are lined up against the
mountains.
Jeeps and Tanks buzz to and fro.
There's a huge stage which is set up with thousands of seats.
There's a giant banner reading "USO SHOW TONIGHT!!!!!"
Loads of soldiers file into their seats.
ANNOUNCER
Alright you men! The USO show is about to
start!!
The military men go wild.
ANNOUNCER
Get ready for loads of entertainment and
fabulous celebrities! To be followed
immediately by the swift and nasty
execution of Terrance and Elroy!
The crowd goes crazy again.
Right out of Nazi Germany.
Barbed wire, guards, the whole
bit.
ANGLE ON BOYS
They are on their backs, shimmying along the ground
underneath the blanket of razor-wire that is set up around
the camp.
The Mole uses the bolt-cutters to cut the wire as he goes,
clearing a path for Stan, Kyle and Cartman.
THE MOLE
Be careful not to touch this wire-
A wire catches on Cartman's arm and SNAPS against his face.
CARTMAN
OW!
MOTHERFUCKER!
BZZAAAAT!!!
CARTMAN
FUC-
Stan shoves his hand over Cartman's mouth, leaving Cartman to
cuss bloody murder into Stan's glove.
CARTMAN
MPHMPH MPHMPHMPH!!!
BZAAT!
CARTMAN
MMMPPPHHH!!!
Finally they clear the fence and lie down in view of the
camp.
THE MOLE
It sounds like the USO show has started.
We have precious little time...
Kyle looks at the horrible concentration camp.
KYLE
Oh my God...
THE MOLE
God? ...Let me tell you something about
God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
Kyle looks at The Mole, oddly.
STAN
How are we ever gonna find them?
The Mole whips out some night vision goggles.
ANGLE ON INTERMENT CAMP THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES
The Mole inspects the camp.
He sees a guard on a guard
tower.
Then he pans over to a bunch of Canadians standing
in a line in rags.
The Mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see
the saddened faces of the Canadians.
KYLE
Do you see them?
Do you see Terrance and
Phillip?
THE MOLE
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will
have to dig.
KYLE
That's gonna take a long time!
THE MOLE
Time? Did time matter to the
Revolutionists who were forced to eat
their own shit while dying in the
dungeons of ze King?
The boys think.
Helicopters zoom over the makeshift stage like the USO show
in Apocalypse Now.
Groups of soldiers cheer as a helicopter approaches the
landing platform and touches down.
The US army men cheer.
The mothers take the stage, and Kyle's mother speaks into the
microphone. Behind her is a huge American flag. She is
wearing an army helmet. This is right out of 'Patton'.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Ladies and gentlemen of the American war
effort, we salute you!
A big cheer goes through the crowd. Kyle's mother feels the
power, and lifts her head high. She starts to pace back and
forth on the stage as she speaks, becoming more and more
Pattonlike.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Tomorrow you will be risking your lives
so that our children will have a better
future... God bless you men. And God
bless this filth free nation. Many of you
will die. Die like blood bathed pigs.
So
tonight, we at MAC present a NIGHT OF A
HUNDRED STARS! Now without further ado, I
give you...
Out of the helicopter emerge a battalion of the best and
brightest stars that the American show biz industry has to
offer.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Pint size pixie and darling of the indie
movie scene, Winona Ryder!
She gestures grandly to the helicopter where Winona Ryder
emerges and runs to center stage and waves to the audience.
She looks like a strung out coke addict; because she is.
WINONA RYDER
Hi guys!
I'm T.V.'s Winona Ryder!
One guy claps.
WINONA RYDER
I want you all to know I'm super psyched
to be here today.
You guys rock.
What
you're doing for our country so sooo
cool.
It's so real.
I've been acting
since I was twelve and I can't
distinguish between make believe and real
life.
Winona falls down. But gets back up immediately.
WINONA RYDER
And then I confuse me real life with my
big-screen one.
And sure, people get
hurt, and I'm sorry about that but
Christ, look at me.
It's not my fault
that I can get any guy I want.
And
that's reality to me.
But you guys...
wow.
I mean, war, man. Fucking war.
It
doesn't get any more real--
Now, this
one goes out to you.
She cues the band which has been assembled from the same
helicopter.
Jazz music starts up.
It's 'New York, New York'. The troops look confused.
WINONA RYDER
You know what I'm gonna do for you now,
don't you?
'New York, New York' continues to play.
WINONA RYDER
WRONG!
(Singing)
The bells are ringin'
For me and my gal!
The birds are singin'
For me and my gal!-
Mole pops his head out of the ground. Immediately, a search
light passes over the hole.
THE MOLE
Sheet!
Mole ducks, just avoiding the light.
Slowly, the boys' heads appear from the hole.
The whole camp is in front of them.
There is a HUGE
barbedwire fence on one side (the side they just dug from)
A
dozen armed guards with huge Dobermans patrol the grounds with
Howitzers.
It doesn't look good.
THE MOLE
Move! Move!
One by one, The Mole, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman pop out of the
ground, and run for a nearby building.
Once at the building,
they all duck to avoid the search lights.
THE MOLE
Okay.... The Americans must be holding
Terrance and Phillip in one of those
bunkers. We will split up here.
Let's
synchronize watches!
The others look at each other.
KYLE
We don't have watches.
A beat.
THE MOLE
You don't have watches?
STAN
Dude, you didn't say anything about
watches.
THE MOLE
What do you think this is kid?
Lick
Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking
kiddie hour?
Huh?
This is real life
with consequences you take to the grave!
KYLE
Dude, we don't have watches.
THE MOLE
Sheet.
Did you bring ze mirror?
STAN
Got it.
THE MOLE
And ze rope?
STAN
Check.
THE MOLE
And the butfor?
KYLE
What's a butfor?
THE MOLE
For pooping, silly.
A beat... Then mole takes a long drag off his cigarette and
slowly blows the smoke.
THE MOLE
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you
stand watch here and await my return. If
any guards come by, make a sound like a
dying giraffe.
KYLE
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
THE MOLE
(Putting his hands to his
mouth)
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
KYLE
Kay.
The Mole turns to Cartman.
THE MOLE
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical
box. You must sneak over zere and shut it
off before I return with Terrance and
Phillip or the alarms will sound and I
will be shot full of holes. Got it?
CARTMAN
Okay.
THE MOLE
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY
IMPORTANT do you understa-
CARTMAN
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU
FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Cartman storms off.
THE MOLE
I will tunnel my way into ze buildings,
and find ze prisoners.
The Mole starts to dig.
KYLE
Be careful, dude.
THE MOLE
Careful? Was my mother careful when she
stabbed me in the heart with a clothes
hanger while I was still in ze womb?
And with that, The Mole quickly starts to tunnel his way
underground.
STAN
Damn, dude, that kid is fucked up.
Back on stage at the USO show.
Winona Ryder is just
finishing up her song.
WINONA RYDER
(Singing)
....It's a hell of a TOWN!
And
that's my New York Melodyyyyyy!!!!
The band finishes with a flourish. Winona takes a bow.
One person in the entire audience claps.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Let's hear it again for the one and only
Winona Ryder!!!
The same guy claps again.
ONE CLAPPING GUY
We love you, Winona!
Everybody else in the audience just stares at him.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Next up we have a special treat...
Please welcome, direct from Vegas- BIG
GAY AL'S BIG GAY EXPERIENCE!!!
The place goes wild as Big Gay Al walks out on stage.
Winona
fumes in the wings.
RANDOM SOLDIER
This guy is the coolest!
RANDOM SOLDIER 2
Totally man!
The back curtain goes up to reveal a tropical jungle set
complete with a waterfall, hippos, monkeys and hundreds of
colorfully dressed dancers.
BIG GAY AL
How we all feeling tonight?!
Between the cheering, we hear a throng of "Happy!". Now the
place is rocking!! Everybody loves Big Gay Al!
Winona can't believe it.
BIG GAY AL
I can't hear you...
CROWD
Happy!!!
BIG GAY AL
Friends, you know why I'm here... I'm
here to teach TOLERANCE!!
The crowd cheers.
BIG GAY AL
I'm here to say that we're all PEOPLE
under God, and we should embrace, and
accept our differences!!
The crowd cheers louder.
BIG GAY AL
And that means we should LOVE CANADIANS
TOO!!
The entire place goes incredibly quiet.
You can hear a pin drop.
Silence...
Deafening silence...
BIG GAY AL
JUST KIDDING!! FUCK 'EM!!!
Slow music swells in. Big Gay Al saunters around the stage
and starts to sing.
BIG GAY AL
(Singing)
Bombs are flying
People are dying
Children are crying
Politicians are lying too
Cancer is killing
Texaco is spilling
The whole world's gone to hell
But how are you?
Suddenly, Big Gay Al is wearing a big feathery outfit and all
his dancers dash to his side.
BIG GAY AL
I'm super!
Thanks for asking!
All things considered I'm doing
super
I must say!
Very peachee
Nothing bugs me
'Cause everything is super when
you're
-don't you think I look cute in
this hat?
The crowd is absolutely confused.
BIG GAY AL
I'm so sorry, Mr. Cripple
But I just can't feel bad for you
right now
Because I'm feeling so insanely
super
That even seeing you in that chair
can't bring me down!
Cartman is by himself, slowly moving from building to
building. He is scared out of his mind.
CARTMAN
(Imitating the Mole)
Shut of ze Power, Cartman. Zis is very
important, Cartman... Stupid British
piece of shi-
(BAZZT!)
OW!
He approaches the electrical box.
Just as he's about to open
it, two armed AMERICAN SOLDIERS round the corner.
Cartman
gets scared and hides in the shadows.
The soldiers continue
walking...
AMERICAN SOLDIER
Dude, if I was gay, I'd be just like Big
Gay AL!
AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
Me too!!
...And pass a terrified Cartman.
The boys are waiting, bored, for The Mole to return.
KYLE
I don't think he's coming back, dude.
Just then, we hear The Mole return from his hole. He is
carrying the ticket guy from the movie theater.
TICKET GUY
Oh thank you! Thank you for getting me
out of there!! They locked me up for
selling movie tickets to minors!
THE MOLE
Is this one of zem?
KYLE
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
THE MOLE
Oh... Alright, back you go.
The Mole takes the Ticket Guy back through the hole.
TICKET GUY
No! Please! I don't want to go back!!
The boys sit back down and wait again.
Meanwhile, Big Gay Al's song continues-
BIG GAY AL
I'm super! Thanks for asking!
All things considered I'm doing
better than okay!
Feeling peaches
nothing bugs me
Everything is super when you're
-don't you think I look cute in
this hat and my little shoes and
this matching tie that I got at
Merv's?
The chorus guys all pick Big Gay Al up and dance around with
him on stage.
CHORUS
He's super! Thanks for asking!
All things considered he is better
than okay!
And it's peachee, nothing bugs him
Everything is super when you're-
Let's fight fight fight against
Canada today!!!!!!
The song ends and everyone erupts into applause.
Cartman approaches the electrical box nervously -- looking
all around for soldiers.
He opens the door to the electrical box and sees a large
switch labeled ON and OFF.
He reaches to turn off the switch
when he feels a tap on his shoulder.
Cartman jumps.
CARTMAN
Agh!!!
Then turns and karate-chops in one spastic flurry to see -
KENNY!!
CARTMAN
Son of a gun!
HECK!
Kenny's ghost is again floating in front of Cartman. Kenny
again struggles to speak.
CARTMAN
GO AWAY, KENNY!
IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN
FAULT!
KENNY
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
CARTMAN
I don't have proofs of purchases from
Snacky Smores, Kenny!
KENNY
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
CARTMAN
AGAGAH!!
Cartman runs off, leaving the power completely on.
INTERNMENT CAMP - STAN AND KYLE'S AREA
Kyle is patiently awaiting Mole's return.
KYLE
Damn it! Come on, Mole we're running out
of time!
Kyle spins around when he hears someone coming.
But it's only Cartman. He's panting heavily.
CARTMAN
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
KYLE
What Cartman?!
CARTMAN
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
STAN
Oh, brother.
KYLE
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Cartman stops breathing heavily and thinks.
KYLE
Cartman?!
CARTMAN
Whoops.
Just then, all the alarms in the place go off.
KYLE
Oh shit!
From the distance, the boys hear gunshots.
Suddenly, the Mole pops out of the hole. The boys see that
The Mole has been shot up badly.
THE MOLE
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
CARTMAN
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
As SHOUTS and RUNNING FOOTSTEPS draw closer, The Mole lays
down and begins to die in Kyle's arms.
THE MOLE
Please... Do not let ze resistance die...
Gentle MUSIC begins.
THE MOLE
Now the light, she fades
And darkness closes in
But I will find strength
I will find pride within
Because although I die
Our freedom will be won
Though I die
Ze Resistance
Lives on...
The Music fades away, as the Mole coughs up some blood.
THE MOLE
It's so very cold...
KYLE
We can't leave without you!
THE MOLE
It's okay, I am done for.
KYLE
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU -
we don't know where the hell we are!!
The Mole coughs up more blood.
THE MOLE
Where is your God when you need him?
Where is your beautiful, merciful faggot
now?
The Mole dies.
KYLE
SHIT!
VOICE
FREEZE!!
The boys look up to see three large MARINES pointing guns at
them.
Stan makes a run for it. He dashes off at full speed.
KYLE
Run, Stan!!
One of the soldiers fires at him. PWANG! PWANG! But Stan
disappears into the night.
PENTAGON GUY
Forget him! The night will swallow him
up.
MARINE
You are under arrest!
Cuff 'em!
KYLE
What?
PENTAGON
So THIS must be the resistance the
pentagon has been tracking!
CARTMAN
Oh, son of a bitch...
Kyle's mother, and the other mothers of MAC, take the stage
again.
KYLE'S MOTHER
And now, for our big finale, the MOMENT
YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!!
Terrance and Phillip are wheeled out onto the stage.
TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip.
This cannot be good.
PHILLIP
I know, Terrance.
This is quite the
shitstorm we've found ourselves in this
time.
From the other side, Kyle's mom appears with a couple of
official looking military people.
The crowd cheers.
KYLE'S MOM
It is my pleasure to present to you, THE
EXECUTION OF TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!!
The crowd cheers.
KYLE'S MOM
Strap them in!
Terrance and Phillip are then greeted by the EXECUTIONER,
donned in a black hood.
The scary giant Executioner grabs Terrance and Phillip and
puts them into electric chairs.
KYLE'S MOM
Today is a great day for democracy!
The crowd cheers.
The Executioner steps up to the throw switch.
TERRANCE
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to
Quebec City when I fell asleep in that
disco.
PHILLIP
I know, Terrance. I know.
LONG SHOT of a desolate, dark area.
It has started to rain. Stan trudges through the wilderness
looking tired and scared.
STAN
Hello? Where the hell am I? Is anybody
here?
A few wolf HOWLS sound in the distance. Stan walks on.
STAN
MARCO!!!
No answer.
STAN
MARCO!!!
No answer. Stan stumbles a bit.
STAN
Dude, weak... Can't go on... Dizzy...
Stan falls to the ground. His face plops in the rainy mud and
his head smacks against a rock.
Stan is out cold.
Just then, a strange sound emerges. It is like a pulsating
WOBBLE. Stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his
flashlight around.
STAN
What is that?
The sound gets louder. Stan shines his flashlight on
something that is huge and throbbing.
STAN
OH MY GOD!!!
Kyle's mother approaches Terrance and Phillip.
KYLE'S MOM
Gentlemen, do you have any last words?
PHILLIP
Last words? Let's see... How aboot "GET
ME THE FUCK OUT OF THIS CHAIR". How's
that for last words?
Kyle's mom nods to the Executioner.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
WAIT!!
General Plymkin walks out next to Kyle's mother.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
We have just captured some Canadian
Sympathizers!
The crowd cheers. Kyle's mother smiles.
KYLE'S MOTHER
We will execute them along with Terrance
and Phillip for your viewing pleasure!
Another cheer. The mothers are all very pleased. That is,
until they see Kyle and Cartman brought out to the stage at
gunpoint.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle?!
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Eric?
KYLE
Hi, ma.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
We also have a Canadian SPY who was
hiding out in South Park!!
Now Ike is brought out at gunpoint.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Ike?!
Kyle's mother rushes over to General Plymkin.
KYLE'S MOTHER
General... These are OUR CHILDREN!
GENERAL PLYMKIN
They are Canadian sympathizers and they
must be dealt with accordingly!
STAN'S MOTHER
But they're CHILDREN!
Cartman walks over to where Terrance and Phillip are strapped
into their chairs.
CARTMAN
Dude! Terrance and Phillip! Wow! Can I
get your autographs?!
TERRANCE
Sure, tubby, just as soon as we're
killed.
KENNY'S MOTHER
We can't kill these kids!
GENERAL PLYMKIN
Listen mothers, YOU'RE the ones that
started all this. Don't get all emotional
NOW!
STAN'S MOTHER
But we're doing all this to help our
children's futures!
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Yes, I think shooting our children would
adversely affect their futures.
KYLE'S MOTHER
No... The General is right.
KYLE
MOM!!!
KYLE'S MOTHER
Boobie... This is the only way you're
ever going to learn. I have an
opportunity here to teach you about
consequences.
STAN'S MOTHER
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are
YOUR children!
KYLE'S MOTHER
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO
BE RUINED BY SMUT!!
(To Kyle)
I am sorry young man, but I have had it
up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
She walks away.
KYLE
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
KYLE'S MOTHER
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR
LANGUAGE!!
Stan is still lying in mud, but now he lies before a HUGE,
pulsating, organic looking thing that belongs in the X-Files.
It's the size of a small building.
The massive thing starts to glow. Stan looks weak and afraid.
BIG THING
Be not afraid...
Stan trembles.
STAN
(Weakly)
What...
BIG THING
Behold my glory.
STAN
What... are you?
BIG THING
I am the clitoris.
Stan's eyes grow wide. MUSIC starts to swell up.
STAN
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE
CLITORIS!!
BIG THING
Stan, your friends need you. They are in
trouble and you must help them.
STAN
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to
get Wendy to like me.
BIG THING
There are more important matters right
now...
STAN
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR
YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO
GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
BIG THING
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her
some ice cream or something.
STAN
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
BIG THING
Now go, your friends are in danger... The
USO show is a mile east of here, just
over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
The clitoris fades, and just as it does, all the kids of La
Resistance come running into frame. Wendy and Gregory are
with them as well.
WENDY
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
STAN
Wendy?
GREGORY
I see you failed in your mission.
Terrance and Phillip must be dead by now.
Wendy bends down to pick up Stan.
WENDY
Come on Stan, we have to hurry. The
Canadian forces are about to attack!!
Wendy pulls Stan up off the ground and slings his arm around
her.
A drummer plays as the execution begins.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
We begin with Terrance and Phillip!!!
Throw the switch!!!
The executioner throws the switch and Terrance and Phillip
start to fry. Kyle, Cartman and Ike, in their chairs, look
horrified.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Goodbye, bastards!
Near death, Terrance cranks out a weak fart. Terrance and
Phillip both laugh weakly but merrily.
TERRANCE
Take that, bitch.
As Terrance and Phillip fry, they scream out:
PHILLIP/TERRANCE
FREEEEEEDOMMMMM!!!
Suddenly, FWWOOOMMM!!! A Bomb lands in the middle of the
army. BLAM!! It explodes with incredible force, sending dead
bodies in all directions.
Canadian military planes zoom overhead! It's a full scale
attack!!
From a HIGH ANGLE we see the soldiers all scatter like bugs
in every direction.
MR. GARRISON
THE CANADIANS ARE ATTACKING!! RUN FOR
YOUR LIVES!!
FWWOOMM!!! BLAMM!! Another explosion!
Everybody just starts
screaming and shooting in every direction.
Total and
complete mayhem.
One explosion knocks out the electricity, and Terrance and
Phillip stop drying.
The electricity runs along a wire, across the stage, and
right up Cartman's leg. Cartman starts frying horribly.
KYLE
CARTMAN!
CARTMAN
(Frying)
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
PHILLIP
What's going on Terrance?
TERRANCE
Canada is saving us!!
Finally, Cartman is blown clear of the electricity. Kyle
picks him up and starts to run along with Ike.
People run screaming in all directions as a full scale attack
has broken out. Gunfire, explosions and dead bodies fly all
around.
JIMBO
Ned!
Behind you!
Ned whips around and mows down a line of Canadians. But one
Canadian makes it through, and sticks his bayonet through
Ned's neck.
Blood gushes from Ned's neck as he collapses.
JIMBO
NED!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!!
FWWOOM!! BLAMMM!!! The boys runs as fast as they can amidst
the explosions.
CARTMAN
HOLY SHIT!
(Zap)
AGHAGHGAH!!
Now when the V-chip shocks Cartman, we can actually see the
blue current swirl around his body.
CARTMAN
HEY! THIS V-CHIP IS GETTING ALL SCREWY!!
General Plymkin has followed his men into the trench, where
explosions and gunfire fly all around. He pulls out a walkie
talkie as his men die all around him.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
ALRIGHT MEN!!!
FALL INTO FORMATION!
"HUMAN SHIELD" UP FRONT THEN "OPERATION
GET BEHIND THE DARKIES"!!!
They all fall in.
A phalanx of black men, Chef included in
them, walk out in front of a bunch of white guys.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
REMEMBER, HUMAN SHIELD!
PROTECT OUR
TANKS AND PLANES, TOO!
Just then, over a ridge in front of them, a line of Canadian
tanks appears. The tanks are lined up 3 deep.
Behind them is
a line of missile launchers.
General Plymkin's jaw drops.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
Holy Mother of Johosephat...
The black guys all look at each other nervously.
The boys run through the chaos.
Body parts and scrapnel fly
here and there.
A bloody soldier suddenly stumbles and falls in front of the
boys holding a massive head wound.
KYLE
Hey! It's Mr. Garrison!!
Garrison lies on the ground, coughing up blood.
MR. GARRISON
Children... Take Mr. Hat... Please... Get
him out of here...
Garrison takes Mr. Hat off his hand and gives it to Cartman.
Just then, Garrison goes limp.
Cartman looks at the Mr. Hat in his hand and scowls. The boys
run from the battle.
They pass the American troops, where all the black guys are
standing in a human shield around the white guys.
CHEF
Alright, squad... JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU...
ONE!!
The Canadian tanks take aim.
CHEF
TWO!
The Canadian tanks fire.
CHEF
THREE!!
All the black guys suddenly jump out of the way, leaving the
whites completely exposed.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
What the-
The tank fire hits the army, blowing all the white soldiers
to smithereens, including Ned and Jimbo.
BLACK SOLDIER
GREAT PLAN, CHEF!
CHEF
Operation Human Shield my ASS!
From an EXTREME WIDE SHOT, we see all the forces on both
sides exchange firepower. The Canadian National anthem can be
heard in the distance.
We see Mr. Mackey looking like a natural born killer.
He
shoots like a maniac into the Canadians.
He wounds one and
then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife.
MR. MACKEY
Die Canadian, mmkay?!
And he drives the knife into the Canadian's chest.
But then, suddenly, another Canadian Soldier appears out of
nowhere, and blows a hole through Mackey's chest.
MR. MACKEY
Mkay-
Mackey falls to the ground, dead. Just then Big Gay Al runs
through the frame, we FOLLOW him as he skips his way around
gunfire.
BIG GAY AL
Ooh! Goodness those bullets are going
FAST!!!
Another bullet zings by his head.
BIG GAY AL
Jumping Jesus, this is insane!!
THUMP! A bullet hits Big Gay Al square in the head. More
bullets follow, tearing him to shreds.
WIDE ANGLE ON - ENTIRE BATTLE
This shot parodies one of the big shots from 'Saving Private
Ryan'. Just complete overkill. Explosions, helicopters,
gunfire and death.
Kyle's mother, and the other mothers as well, stand on a
ridge overlooking the horrific massacre.
STAN'S MOTHER
My God... This is terrible...
Kyle's mother holds out her M-16. She is now completely
insane.
KYLE'S MOTHER
This is what we wanted! We wanted our
children to be brought up in a smut-free
environment!!!
KENNY'S MOTHER
But we didn't want THIS. I just followed
you 'cause I made a shitload of money
selling Kenny t-shirts!
STAN'S MOTHER
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
KYLE'S MOTHER
Wake up, people!
We all have to do
things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's
the not pretty things that make life
worth fighting the not pretty things for!
Why do you think children have to be born
in hospitals?
The other mothers look very confused.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Why does it matter?! My plan is a perfect
plan!!
Perfect!
Perfect! Perfect!!!!!
The other mothers walk away.
KYLE'S MOTHER
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the
not pretty things from letting our
children be born in hospitals!
STAN'S MOTHER
We're going to find our boys! For God's
sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
Kyle's mother turns back to the battle. More killing and
explosions.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Killed.
They should only be so lucky.
Kyle wasn't even BORN in a hospital!
She charges the field.
Terrance and Phillip are dodging gunfire and super loud
explosions.
PHILLIP
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
TERRANCE
You did? Just now?
They laugh merrily.
PHILLIP
Come on, we can take shelter in one of
those buildings!
But just then, Kyle's mother comes charging in with her gun!!
KYLE'S MOTHER
AAAGHGAHGHGH!!! YOU DESTROYED MY
FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!
Phillip spins around just in time to see Kyle's mother
plunge her bayonet into Terrance's abdomen.
TERRANCE
AGH!
PHILLIP
Terrance! NO!
KYLE'S MOTHER
DIE!!!!!!
SLOW MOTION SHOT -
Blood from Terrance's abdomen slowly spills from his stomach.
Everything gets SILENT as we follow the blood down, down,
down...
Until it hits the ground with a huge, echoing BWOOOMMMM!!!
CLOSE UP on Kyle's mother's eyes.
CLOSE UP on the spot of blood on the ground...
BACK TO REAL TIME
Suddenly, the ground starts to open up! FWOOM!! Great flames
and ash take over the sky.
Satan and his minions explode from below. Everyone stops
fighting for a moment, to watch this amazing spectacle.
SATAN
RAAGHGH!!!! MY TIME HAS COME!!!
Demons and flames emerge from the ground. All the soldiers on
both sides can't believe what they're seeing.
Now out of the giant abyss comes Kenny. He dusts himself off
and looks around.
As more bombs and gunshots go off. Kyle, Cartman and Ike
huddle close to each other in a trench.
CARTMAN
Kyle... All those times I said you were a
big dumb Jew... I didn't mean it. You're
not a Jew.
Kyle thinks.
KYLE
Yes I am!
IKE
Baba mama!
Another explosion rocks the trench. Dirt flies all over the
boys' heads.
CARTMAN
AGH!
(Noticing Mr. Hat in his hand)
What the hell am I still holding this
for?!
Cartman tosses Mr. Hat out of the trench. We hear GUNSHOTS
and then VERY FAINTLY we hear Garrison's voice.
MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat! Noooooo!
Suddenly, Stan jumps down into the trench.
KYLE
Stan!
STAN
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can
get Wendy to like me now!
KYLE
Sweet.
CARTMAN
(Sarcastic)
Oh, that's swell, Stan. I guess all's
well that ends well, huh? We can go home
now. There's just one little thing left
to tie up... WORLD WAR THREE!!!
More explosions go off. Dead bodies fly all around the boys.
Suddenly, Kenny appears before the boys.
CARTMAN/KYLE
AGAGAH!!!
CARTMAN
It's him! I told you!! Kenny's come to
take us to the netherworld!
KENNY
Mph rmph rmph rmph?!
KYLE
Wait! He's not haunting us, he's trying
to tell us something!
KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph rm!
CARTMAN
Okay!
We can get you some proofs of
purchases for Snacky Smores Kenny!
Just
mellow the heck out!
More battle. People are dying left and right.
The Doctor from the Hospital scene runs in with an M-16. A
Canadian steps in front of him, the doctor shoots, and blows
the Canadian's head clean off.
DOCTOR GAUCHE
Hey, pal, don't lose your head.
Suddenly, the ticket guy's chest rips open. He falls dead,
and standing behind him is a Canadian with a double barreled
shotgun.
CANADIAN SOLDIER
I'm glad you got that off your chest.
Tom the Rhinoplasty surgeon leaps in and stabs the Canadian
through the head with his bayonet.
TOM
I guess he got the point.
A Canadian rushes in and machine guns Tom full of holes.
CANADIAN SOLDIER 2
Plastics are a cheap and efficient
insulator for electrical applications.
Just as the fighting escalates, Satan and his minions rush
in.
SATAN
Yes! Good! Fight and kill one another!
The soldiers all look scared and puzzled.
SATAN
You're all part of Satan's army now!
KYLE'S MOTHER
What the hell is going on?!
Satan gets in Kyle's mother's face.
SATAN
I am the dark master!
KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I
don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
SATAN
SILENCE!
I AM SATAN!
KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh.
SATAN
YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE
INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME...
NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF
DARKNESS!!
AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
Kyle's mother backs down, ashamed.
CHEF
Oh, good job, Mrs. Broflofski, thanks a
lot.
KYLE'S MOTHER
I... I was just trying to make the world
a better place for children...
SATAN
Yes... And in doing so, you brought
enough anger and intolerance to the world
to allow my coming.
KYLE'S MOTHER
And I thought my mother was the master of
guilt.
Geez Louise.
SATAN
SILENCE!!!
NOW!!!
EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO
ME!!!
KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh God... What have I done...
One by one, the soldiers start to kneel.
Satan throws his arms up in the air and laughs a horrible,
deep laugh that fills the world.
But just then, the ground shakes again. Satan looks over to
the huge abyss he had crawled out of and notices another
figure.
He is burnt horribly, but it is Saddam. He holds a martini
glass in his hand.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Hey, I'm missing the party!
SATAN
No! It can't be!
Saddam, burnt to a crisp, walks over to Satan and grabs his
ass.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Did you miss me, buttercup?
(Yelling out)
All right, gang! I am your new ruler now!
Everyone bow down to ME!!
Satan puts his head down.
KYLE
HOLD EVERYTHING!!!
Kyle walks up with Cartman, Stan and Kenny.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Oh, it's the bratty kid from hell.
KYLE
You made a deal with Kenny that if he got
ten proofs of purchases from Snacky
Smores you'd grant him any wish.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
And?
Kenny pulls out the proofs of purchases. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC
plays.
SATAN
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking
with him!
KYLE
What?
SADDAM HUSSEIN
The deal's off, go away, guy.
SATAN
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't
just renege on a deal. That's lying.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Relax bitch!
You're better seen, not
hear okay?
Saddam smacks Satan in the face. Now Satan looks mad, but he
sits down like a good little bitch.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Now, let's start torturing people, shall
we? We'll start with...
(Looks at Cartman)
THIS little fat kid first!!
CARTMAN
AY!
Don't call me fat, buttfucker-
ZAP!!
A huge CHARGE shoots from Cartman, knocking one of
hell's demons on his ass.
STAN
Holy shit Cartman!
What was that?!
CARTMAN
How the fuck should I know!!
ZAP!!! Another huge CHARGE emits from the v-chip inside
Cartman and sends the other Swedish Soldier reeling.
KYLE
Look at that!
CHEF
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you,
Eric!
The polarity must have been
reversed by the electric chair!
TERRANCE
Oh boy!
A smile comes across Cartman's face.
CARTMAN
BUTTFUCKING SHIT!
BZZZZZZZZT!
A huge charge busts the chains that hold
Cartman's wrists.
He jumps down.
CARTMAN
Yes!
TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays as Cartman uses his newly found power.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Quick, Satan!
Do something!
But before Satan can do anything, Cartman holds up his hands
and lets loose.
CARTMAN
FUCK A HUNK A SHIT, YOU RAT FUCK!!!
BZZZZZZZZZAAT!!!!
A charge hits Satan square between the
eyes and knocks him down.
He gets to his knees and stands up again.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Hey, you need to watch your mouth, brat!
CARTMAN
Try this on for size-
Cartman holds up his hands.
CARTMAN
DRIPPING VAGINA EATING SON OF A
PIGFUCKING CRACK WHORE!!! HAIRY COCK
SLURPING MAGGOT FUUUUUCK!!!!
BZZZAAAAT!!
The charge hits Saddam in the chest.
He drops again.
Saddam looks around and is suddenly scared.
He appeals to
Cartman.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Hey buddy!
No need to stress! Let me
make you a deal!
How about a lifetime
supply of Snacky Smores and we just
forget about this whole thing?!
KYLE
Don't listen to him, Cartman!
KENNY
Mrphmmmph!!!
CARTMAN
(giving in)
Okay.
(then)
Not.
Cartman closes his eyes and hums like he's summoning up the
worst words in the world.
Then, it comes out.
Like a volcano.
CARTMAN
SUCK THE HOT SHIT FROM MY GURGLING ASS
YOU BLOOD DRENCHED FROZEN TAMPON ON A
STIIIIIIIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZATTTTTTTTT!!!!!
A huge purple jolt emerges from each of Cartman's hands and
joins into one powerful current that hits Saddam.
Saddam is
thrown back against the wall.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
(To Satan)
What are you waiting for, bitch?! Destroy
him!!
Satan looks at Cartman, then at Saddam, and thinks...
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Come on you weak, stupid cum bucket! Save
me!!
Satan stands there.
SATAN
Help you? You've destroyed my life and
now you want me to help you?!
You're
always making me feel like a piece of
shit.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Come on guy, you know I only rib you
because I love you so much!
SATAN
If you love somebody then you treat them
with respect!
You've never respected me!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Can we talk about this later?
Everyone
is watching!
SATAN
I don't care!
I want to talk about it
now!
Saddam grabs Satan by the arm.
SATAN
Ow, you're hurting me!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in
front of my friends!
You know how I get
mad when I get embarassed.
Satan starts getting really mad.
Steam starts coming from
his nostrils.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Your little problems can wait til later,
see?
Steam starts coming out of Satan's nostrils.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Now do what I say and keep your fucking
mouth shut!
SATAN
THAT'S IT!
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Satan picks up Saddam, and throws him over a huge, flaming
cliff, back into the depths of hell.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
NOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo!!!!! Heeeeyyyy
guyyyyy, relaaaaaxx.....
CHEF
Saddam Hussein is dead!
STAN AND KYLE
Hooray!!!
Everyone cheers.
PHILLIP
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little
boy!
TERRANCE
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of
words!
CARTMAN
Well, I learned it all from you guys.
PHILLIP
Of course you did, cock fuck!
They all laugh merrily.
Satan stands over the cliff, looking down at where Saddam
fell.
SATAN
He spent so much time convincing me I was
weak and stupid that I believed it
myself.
The boys look at each other, confused.
SATAN
Saddam didn't respect me.
All he wanted
was sex.
But it took me so long to
figure that out.
He starts to cry.
Chef hands him a hanky.
CHEF
Here you go Satan-
SATAN
Thank you. Give me the proofs of
purchases.
Kenny hands them to Satan.
SATAN
Okay Kenny, I will keep the bargain. Any
wish you want is yours.
TRACK IN slowly on Kenny. MUSIC BUILDS. Finally, Kenny
speaks.
KENNY
Mph rmph rmpg rmph mm.
Everyone GASPS!!
KYLE
WHAT?
STAN
Are you sure, Kenny?
SATAN
What did he say?
STAN
He said that his wish is for everyone who
died in the war to come back.
CHEF
Kenny, you realize this wish is the only
chance for YOU not to be dead...
KENNY
M mprh. Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm.
Mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm.
Triumphant music plays, as if Kenny is giving a grand,
important speech.
SATAN
Very well, then. I will put an end to the
war as your wish and make everything as
it was before the war started. But you
Kenny, must remain dead.
KENNY
Mph rm.
Satan turns to the open abyss.
SATAN
I must admit, I'm kind of relieved. It's
too fucking cold up here.
STAN
Aren't there cold parts of hell?
SATAN
Yeah, but it's a real dry cold. Here it's
the humidity that gets me. I guess I'm
destined to live in hell... alone...
Sadly, Satan walks back down the trench into hell. But
something catches his eye.
SATAN
Hello... What's this?
Satan bends down and picks up Mr. Hat. He looks at it, and
then places it gently on his hand.
SATAN
Hi there, little guy... Would you like to
go to hell with me?
SATAN (AS MR. HAT)
Sure. I bet we can be best friends!
Satan smiles. And walks down to hell with Mr. Hat.
The boys walks over to Kenny.
KYLE
Thank you, Kenny.
STAN
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for
us. You're a real pal.
A bright red light flashes and Satan and his minions are
dragged back down into hell. Kenny is taken along with them.
At the same time, Garrison, Jimbo, Mackey and all the others
who died, suddenly and magically appear. They look at
themselves, wondering what just happened.
Everyone just stands around in a daze. Canadians and
Americans alike look at each other and wonder what to do.
MR. GARRISON
I... I'm alive... Where's Mr. Hat?
BIG GAY AL
Wow... We were all killed and now we're
fine. That's super!
KYLE
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
STAN
Yeah, but you know, I learned something
today.
I learned that getting all worked
up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is
just stupid... You all focused so hard on
erasing profanity that you forgot the
most important thing... To love each
other.
CARTMAN
Yeah! You're all a bunch of stupid sons a
bitches!
The boys' parents walk up.
STAN
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going
to have fun with profanity just like you
and dad did when you were little.
KYLE
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or
dicksucker or, or-
KYLE'S MOTHER
Shiteater-
STAN'S MOTHER
-Or monkey fucker-
They all laugh merrily at their naughtiness.
Wendy walks up to Stan.
WENDY
I'm sorry Stan, I guess you really DO get
it after all!
Stan smiles. MUSIC swells.
STAN
Wendy... How would you like to go get
some ice cream?
WENDY
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice
cream?
STAN
My friend the clitoris told me.
WENDY
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
STAN
Really? Where the hell do you keep it?
It's huge.
Wendy grabs Stan and plants a big kiss on him. Stan vomits
into Wendy's mouth.
STAN
But Wendy... What about Gregory?
Gregory stands off to one side, scowling.
WENDY
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
STAN
You didn't?
WENDY
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
STAN
Cool!
WENDY
(Singing)
Thank my lucky stars
Here before me now
Is everything I'd ever hoped for-
STAN
Knew it in a word
Saw it in a glance
The only thing I think I'd die for
STAN AND WENDY
I can't stop now... My heart's
awake!
I pray your arms my arms to take!
So this is why I'm alive!
Now everyone joins hands and starts singing-
EVERYONE
SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE, UNCLEFUCKA!
YOU'RE A COCK SUCKING ASS RAPING
UNCLEFUCKA!
YOU'RE AN UNCLEFUCKA, YES IT'S
TRUE!
NOBODY FUCKS UNCLES QUITE LIKE YOU!
UNCLEFUCKAAA!!!
Kenny's mom and dad come up.
KENNY'S DAD
This is all so wonderful.
I just wish
our little Kenny could see all of this
joy.
KYLE
Oh he can, dude.
Look!
Kyle points to the sky.
Everyone looks up just in time to
see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky.
We follow the shooting star and then slowly ZOOM in on it.
As we get closer, we realize it is actually Kenny, shooting
towards the heavens.
As TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays, Kenny's little body floats up and
up through the clouds. (NOTE:
This will also be done in 3-D
CGI)
Rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into
the warmth of the baby blueness.
Angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings.
They smile
gently.
He feels calm.
He feels good.
Amidst a group of angels, Kenny flies upwards and finally...
into Heaven.
END.
