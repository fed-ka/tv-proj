Hale and Deakins are sparring in a ring. Other people are
lifting weights, shooting baskets.
IN THE RING
Hale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out
of his head.
DEAKINS
You know what happened there?
HALE
Hell, I barely know what day it is.
DEAKINS
I set you up. I fake right, go
left three times in a row. You
expect it again, I take the right
in hard. That's what boxing's all
about. Make your opponent think
you're gonna do one thing, then do
another. Like Ali in Zaire, using
the rope-a-dope on Foreman.
(mimes rope-a-dope)
Everyone thought Ali's arms were
getting destroyed, when he was
really just letting Foreman tire
himself out. Eighth round, Ali
starts hitting, George's got
nothing left -- fight's over.
HALE
The fact that I can't feel the
left side of my face -- that's
okay, right?
Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly
launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches.
THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GYM
Take notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring.
DEAKINS
Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught
off guard. It looks like he might even go down.
2.
HALE
He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he
doesn't. He drops his fist.
DEAKINS
Seizes the opportunity and slugs back.
THE CROWD
Loves it.
HALE AND DEAKINS
Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.
DEAKINS
Don't watch my hands -- watch my
shoulders. That's where the punch
starts. Ready?
Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back.
THE SPECTATORS
Are circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering.
HALE AND DEAKINS
DEAKINS
You were looking at my hands.
Let's try it again. Ready?
Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run.
DEAKINS
Come on. Focus. Ready?
(PUNCH)
My shoulders. Ready?
Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It
connects.
HALE
Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth.
DEAKINS
He's in silhouette, the lights above him.
HALE
Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath.
3.
HALE AND DEAKINS
Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores
Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out
of the ring between the ropes.
Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his
feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head.
Hale lets the water rinse the blood off his face.
Hale and Deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers,
getting into their flightsuits, pulling on boots. Deakins is
smoking a cigarette. The smoke curls up into the light slanting
down across the room from high windows.
HALE'S LOCKER
Is in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures
of exotic planes -- the SR-71, a swept-wing fighter, an artist's
rendition of the Aurora, etc.
DEAKINS' LOCKER
On the shady side of the room. Nothing on the inside of his
locker door. The locker is spare, Zen-like in its neatness.
HALE
Here.
HALE'S HAND
Slams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench.
DEAKINS
I can't take that.
HALE
Oh, shut up.
DEAKINS
Really. I feel bad. How many times
have we fought and how many times
have you won?
HALE
Jerk.
DEAKINS
Well, if you insist.
Deakins grins, folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit.
4.
DEAKINS
You know why I beat you?
HALE
Because you've been boxing for
twenty years and you're much
better at it than I am?
DEAKINS
You don't want it enough. You had
me today. I was back on my heels.
But you didn't close the door.
HALE
We were just sparring.
DEAKINS
Life isn't sparring, Hale.
HALE
I think I saw that on a T-shirt.
Deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale.
DEAKINS
Here.
HALE
No, that's yours.
DEAKINS
If you weren't giving it
everything you've got, then I
don't want it.
HALE
No, I mean -- that's yours,
literally. I took it out of your
wallet when you were in the shower.
Deakins laughs, puts the money away.
Deakins and Hale enter to find GENERAL BOONE, 50s.
DEAKINS/HALE
General.
5.
BOONE
Gentlemen.
(nods at NO SMOKING
SIGN)
Deak?
DEAKINS
Sorry.
(puts out cigarette)
What's the mission, General?
BOONE
Simulate a border penetration. Hug
the ground. Scare some cows. See
if anyone can spot you.
HALE
The usual ...?
BOONE
No, actually, it's a little
unusual. You're carrying a couple
of nukes tonight, fellas.
(off their looks)
Palmdale's afraid low-level gamma
and x-ray diffusion might screw up
the peripherals. They asked us to
send a couple on a run, see if
anything glows.
HALE
'61s?
BOONE
(shakes head)
Big ones. '83s.
HALE
Ooh. Crowpleasers.
A BOMB TRUCK carrying two B-83 nuclear weapons drives under the
wing of a big, black plane, toward the open bomb bays. GROUND
CREWMEN are hurrying about.
HALE AND DEAKINS
Enter and walk under the plane, nodding to the ground crew. Hale
and Deakins are royalty. Deakins and Hale climb up the
airplane's Crew Entry steps and disappear.
Hale and Deakins climb into a very strange cockpit. There are
two pilots' seats in this plane, with duplicate controls.
6.
But instead of the usual dials and gauges on the control panels,
there are FOUR COMPUTER SCREENS in front of each pilot. Hale
gets into the left seat; Deakins the right. They review
information on their screens, flip switches.
INTERCUT WITH BOMBS
Being loaded into the bomb bays. When they've been clamped into
place in the rotary bomb racks...
DEAKINS
(into helmet mike)
Ready for rollout.
Alarm horns sound, wheels roll on track and the huge hangar
doors open revealing...
THE GHOST
An enormous black flying wing.
Deakins looks at maps on his computer screens. Hale looks over,
sees the map of Utah.
HALE
You know, these exercises are
fantastic. I mean, when that day
comes and we finally go to war
against Utah, we are really going
to kick ass.
CUT TO:
Deakins and Hale check their screens.
DEAKINS
(thinks of something)
Weren't you going to call Taylor
today about the Aurora Project?
HALE
Yeah. Turns out he wants people
with more fighter hours.
DEAKINS
What'd you say?
HALE
What could I say?
DEAKINS
Jesus. You are such a pussy. You
never fight for anything.
Hale is stung. Pissed, he goes on the offensive.
HALE
Yeah, well you know what your
problem is?
DEAKINS
Because I said what your problem
is, you're gonna--?
HALE
You fight too much.
(Deakins look at him)
Right? You said it yourself --
you should be at least Wing
Commander by now. Maybe you would
be if you didn't insist on telling
people what they're doing wrong
all the time.
DEAKINS
I'm usually right though, aren't I?
Hale shakes his head, grins. Deakins clicks on his mike.
DEAKINS
Ghost 7 to McMurran. Hey,
Wilkins, you old bag of dirt, your
boys in Utah still awake?
9.
Jammed with MEN looking at radar screens and computer monitors.
COLONEL WILKINS, 50s, seen it all, talks over a headset.
WILKINS
Ready and waiting, Mr. Deakins.
And tell our favorite hotshot,
he's not gonna lose us tonight.
Deakins covers his mike, turns to Hale.
DEAKINS
Wilkins says you won't lose them
tonight.
HALE
Tell Colonel Wilkins I could fly
this puppy up his ass without him
knowing.
DEAKINS
(grins, shakes his
head; into helmet
MIKE)
Hale says ... if anyone can catch
him it'd be you.
CU RADAR SCREEN
The Ghost makes a prominent blip on the screen.
WILKINS
Everyone get a fix! They're about
to turn out the lights!
Deakins turns to Hale.
DEAKINS
Ready, Major?
HALE
On your word.
DEAKINS
Go to war.
10.
CLOSE ON CONTROL PANEL - THREE BUTTONS
The left, labeled TAKE OFF, is lighted. The other two buttons
are MISSION and LANDING. Hale pushes MISSION.
THE COCKPIT
everything goes quiet.
CU RADAR SCREEN
The Ghost's blip disappears.
WILKINS
Lost 'em on active! Who's still
got 'em?
IR CREWMAN
Got their heat signature, sir.
(points to computer
SCREEN)
Their engines may be cold, but the
air is colder.
CU COMPUTER SCREEN
Half of the screen shows a waveform, like a voiceprint. The
other half shows a triangle moving across a map of Colorado.
Deakins studies the maps on the computer screens.
DEAKINS
Descend to 400 feet AGL. River
valley approach.
HALE
Airspeed lock at point-seven Mach.
Blue line descent on throttle to
400 feet AGL.
Hale pulls back on the throttle. The plane descends.
HALE
Time to limbo down. How low can
we go.
11.
The triangle representing the Ghost disappears from a computer
screen.
IR CREWMAN
Lost 'em.
WILKINS
Stay on it. They're gonna have to
come up for air sooner or later.
Deakins reads his computer screens.
DEAKINS
We're under the radar. Proceed to
primary target.
Hale hits a button, lets go of the stick -- they're on
autopilot. It's a moment of peace. Hale looks out.
HALE
I tell people I became a pilot
because I wanted to fly cool
planes. It's also for this. When
we're up here, I feel... closer
... I don't know.
DEAKINS
To God? Is that what you're going
to say? That you feel closer to
God up here?
(SNORTS)
Hell, Hale, with the payload we're
carrying, we are God.
Deakins notices something odd on his screen. He checks between
the screen and what he can see through the windshield.
DEAKINS
Hale, take a look out your side.
I think our terrain following is
off. It's got us two klicks from
the left flank ridge.
Hale turns to look out the window on his side.
HALE'S POV
Looking out the window. There's some movement in the reflection
in the glass. QUICK PULL FOCUS to see, distorted in the curve
of the window, Deakins reaching inside his flight suit.
13.
HALE
Turns his head back toward Deakins.
HALE
Deak, you can't smoke in here --
But then Hale sees it's not a cigarette that Deakins is pulling
out of his flight suit. It's shiny, metal. It's...
A GUN
And Deakins levels it right at Hale's head and his finger starts
to squeeze the trigger.
HALE
Grabs Deakins' hand, pushing up as...
DEAKINS
Pulls the trigger and the gun FIRES.
HALE
The bullet cuts a line through the top of his helmet, punching
a hole in the window by his head.
DEAKINS AND HALE
Deakins goes for another shot, but Hale grabs the gun and pushes
up, sending bullets through the ceiling of the plane, into the
walls. Deakins forces the gun down, fires.
THE BULLET
Tears through Hale's harness, blowing apart a shoulder strap.
HALE AND DEAKINS
Hale brings Deakins' gun hand hard against Hale's own helmet.
Deakins yowls and the gun goes flying. Then Hale sees something.
THE PLANE
Is banking towards a ridge-line cliff wall.
HALE
Sees it, yanks on the stick.
THE PLANE
Banks hard away from the cliff, just missing.
14.
ARMAMENTS CONTROL BUTTONS
Buttons include ONE, TWO, LOCK, LEFT, RIGHT, OPEN, CLOSE, ARM
and RELEASE. Deakins presses ONE and TWO, then RIGHT.
HALE
No!
He pulls at Deakins' arms.
CU COMPUTER SCREENS
Graphics of bomb racks rotate, the B-83 nukes -- labeled and
glowing red -- move into the bottom spot. The word RELEASE
appears on the screen. Next to it, the word UNARMED flashes.
HALE AND DEAKINS
Deakins hits Hale with the back of his hand, knocking him back.
Hale grabs Deakins' helmet, yanks it off his head and smashes
Deakins back with it. Hale keys the armament buttons.
CU COMPUTER SCREENS
The nukes rotate out of the release position. RELEASE and
UNARMED disappear.
HALE AND DEAKINS
Deakins grabs a fire extinguisher, swings it, getting Hale in
the face. Hale is almost knocked out, blood running from his
nose.
Hale groggy, hears a loud click. He looks down to see...
DEAKINS' HAND
AUTO to MANUAL. Deakins grabs Hale's EJECTION HANDLE.
HALE AND DEAKINS
Hale tries to push the handle down as Deakins pulls it up as...
Hale and Deakins look at each other as the plane enters the
light and the light, in SLOW MOTION, washes across their faces.
DEAKINS
Suddenly lets go of Hale's hand, then hits Hale hard under the
chin with the fire extinguisher.
HALE
His head snaps back as Deakins pulls.
HALE'S EJECTION SEAT HANDLE
Pop, hiss like a huge vacuum-sealed can is being opened.
Debris -- coffee cups, flight bags, anything not nailed down --
is whipping around the inside of the cabin. Deakins reaches
through the maelstrom, then reaches to the ARMAMENT BUTTONS and
punches them.
The the clamps snap back and the two B-83s drop toward the earth.
Deakins looks around, then gets an idea. He hits the LANDING
mission mode button and the cockpit lights up.
The Ghost starts popping up on everyone's screens. There's a
chorus of "I got em!" and "They're ba-a-a-ck!" Wilkins looks at
a screen, puzzled.
WILKINS
They're not due for another
halfhour.
Deakins yells into his helmet mike as he gets ready to eject.
DEAKINS
(into helmet mike)
This is Deakins! Hale lost it!
I have to punch out!
Deakins pulls his second handle. BLAM! WHOOSH! He's gone. He
hear and feel the plane dropping, screaming toward the earth.
CU RADAR SCREEN
The Ghost's blip suddenly disappears from the screen. A chorus
of "What the hell?" and "Jesus."
WILKINS
That's not good.
17.
The helicopter glides over wind-whipped sand, searchlights on.
Rhodes sits with MCKELLAR, the pilot. Lieutenants KELLY, REED
and THOMAS are in the back.
IN THE SAND
Something glints in the searchlights but the helicopter moves on.
RHODES
Hold it. Come back.
The lights sweep back, find...
THE TIP OF BLACK WING
Sticking out of the sand.
CUT TO:
AKA "The War Room." Phones, faxes, computers, TV monitors,
backlit maps and coffee. Present are GENERALS (including Air
Force General CREELEY), the CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF
STAFF (CHAIRMAN) and ASSISTANTS, all in uniform. They turn as...
BAIRD
Enters. Baird, 60s, is the White House Chief of Staff. His
assistant stays in the b.g. as Baird walks in.
18.
BAIRD
So, do I wake the President?
CHAIRMAN
Where is he -- Las Vegas?
BAIRD
(NODS)
Computer convention. Some
information superhighway crap.
CHAIRMAN
Let him sleep for now.
(hands Baird a piece
of paper)
We're going out with this. Rick's
team prepared it.
The chairman nods toward RICK. Baird reads, mumbling.
BAIRD
"United States Air Force ...
regrets to announce ... C-130
heavy-lift cargo plane ... down
over the Utah desert ... status of
crew not determined at this time
... yadda yadda ... Nice bullshit,
Rick.
Baird hands it to Rick, who starts for the door.
GILES (O.S.)
That's a mistake.
The room quiets. All eyes on...
GILES
Baird's intensely competent assistant.
BAIRD
Giles ...?
GILES
Aviation Week has been following
this plane's development for
years. They have stringers who
spend their vacations sitting in
lawnchairs all night long by the
Whiteman perimeter fence just in
case one of these things takes
off. The boys in those lawnchairs
know one took off tonight. They're
going to know when it doesn't come
back.
(MORE)
19.
GILES (cont'd)
And when we put out a press
release saying a C-130 went down
in Utah, they're going to put two
and two together. Aviation week
will run a story, everyone'll know
what really happened and we're
going to look real stupid.
(BEAT)
We might as well tell the truth.
BAIRD
(mock shock)
The truth? How the hell did you
get this job?
A few chuckles in the room. Baird looks at the Chairman --
well? The Chairman thinks for a second, nods. Baird turns to
Rick.
BAIRD
Rewrite it. What Giles just said.
Rick grits his teeth and hurries out. Baird looks at Giles.
BAIRD
I want you in Utah. Now.
Giles nods, heads out. Baird grabs his arm.
BAIRD
You scare me sometimes.
GILES
Hell, sir. Sometimes I scare
myself.
And out Giles goes.
Wilkins talks to Rhodes over the radio.
WILKINS
Watch your needles!
20.
Stunned silence. They've just gotten the news. Baird doesn't
know what it means.
BAIRD
Broken Arrow?
CHAIRMAN
That's what we call it when we
lose a nuclear weapon.
BAIRD
Oh, Jesus.
(thinks, shakes head)
I don't know what's scarier --
losing nuclear weapons or the fact
that it happens so often that you
people have a term for it.
Wilkins is on the radio with Rhodes.
WILKINS
Find the nukes, Sam. But be
careful. I know they say those
eggs can't be cracked, but if your
geigers pick up more rads than
you'd get off a toaster, I want
you out of there.
Wilkins to the CORPORAL.
WILKINS
Get the teams in. I want Colonel
Rhodes and his men backed up.
21.
CU COMPUTER SCREEN
Various views of a B-83 nuclear weapon. Creeley is briefing
Baird on the nukes.
BAIRD
They dropped from a plane but they
didn't go off...?
CREELEY
They have to be armed to detonate.
BAIRD
Then they're destroyed?
CREELEY
(shakes head)
They're designed to survive
crashes intact. They can lie in
a pool of burning jet fuel for
five hours without any problem.
BAIRD
How did this happen?
CREELEY
In his last transmission, Colonel
Deakins said Major Hale lost
control. He probably hit weapons
release by accident. Believe me,
when a plane's auguring in, you
start pushing every button you can.
Baird stands, looks at a picture of a Ghost shakes his head.
BAIRD
Hell, we should take the cost of
the plane out of major Hale's
salary. Although I guess at two
billion dollars a pop, that could
take a while.
The helicopter flies low. Rhodes looks at a device on his lap.
ON THE DEVICE'S SCREEN
Green, like a radar screen. It's blank, and then two dots
appear on the outer edge of the screen.
RHODES
Got 'em!
Novacek flips switches in the helicopter, getting ready to start
up. Deakins reaches in, flips off a switch marked COM LINK.
Silence from the speakers.
WILKINS
Sam? Sam, are you there? Sam?
Kelly's voice comes in over the speaker.
31.
KELLY (V.0.)
(TERRIFIED)
Colonel Wilkins? You there?
WILKINS
Who is this?
KELLY (V.0.)
It's Lieutenant Kelly, sir.
WILKINS
What happened, Kelly?
Wilkins slumps in his chair.
WILKINS
Call back the teams and get me the
Room. We're gonna need NEST in
here.
Hale and Terry are riding in Terry's truck. Terry drives. Hale
is wearing work clothes. After some silence...
HALE
What's your dog's name?
TERRY
Bear. I was going to call him
Death, so I could say things like,
"I walk with Death," and "Death
chewed my boots," but I chickened
out. You?
HALE
No dog.
33.
TERRY
Do you have a name, or is that
classified?
Before Hale can answer...
THE SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER
Rises up in front of them, Novacek piloting. Novacek thumbs a
button and machine guns on the sides open up.
TERRY AND HALE
Terry jumps on the brakes. She and Hale bail out as...
THE TRUCK
is riddled with bullets and explodes.
TERRY AND HALE
Sprint up the trail.
HALE
We've gotta hide!
TERRY
Follow me!
Terry leads Hale up a short slope. Hale scrambles over the top
and is stunned. Terry runs out onto an open expanse -- no cover.
HALE
Hide where?
IN THE HELICOPTER
Novacek grins, shoots.
HALE
Looks at the helicopter as the bullets whistle in. When he
turns back, Terry's gone.
HALE
What the --?
TERRY (O.S)
Come on!
Hale runs in the direction of her voice.
NOVACEK'S POV
Aiming at Hale's back. But then Hale suddenly drops from view.
34.
HALE
Arms flailing, drops fifteen feet, to deep sand.
TERRY
This way.
Terry runs. Hale follows.
HALE
How do you --?
TERRY
(looks back, still
RUNNING)
I'm a Ranger. I've been over
these trails a million times.
Not looking, Terry runs straight into a wall, smacks her head
and drops like a rock.
IN THE HELICOPTER
Novacek can't see his prey. He gets an idea and reaches back.
TERRY AND HALE
Terry is trying to get her eyes to focus.
TERRY
Please don't tell anyone I did
that.
IN THE HELICOPTER
Novacek has a box of grenades beside him. He pulls the pin on
a grenade and drops it.
TERRY AND HALE
Hale is helping Terry to her feet as BOOM -- the first grenade
goes off. They run.
THE HELICOPTER
Chases them, strafing them. BOOM! -- a grenade goes off in
front of them. They run back. They're cornered. Hale looks
around, looks up.
HALE
Can you climb up?
TERRY
Yeah ...?
HALE
Give me your gun.
35.
TOP OF CLIFF
Terry climbs up into view of...
NOVACEK
Who sees her.
TERRY
Pull herself up, stands, hands up.
THE HELICOPTER
Novacek swivels the helicopter around.
TERRY
This has nothing to do with me.
NOVACEK
Tell me where he is!
HALE
Is down in the fissure, pointing the revolver straight up at the
helicopter hovering right overhead, figuring out where to shoot.
HALE
Blackhawk ... Moved pilot seat
back a foot ... Puts him right
about ... here.
Hale hesitates -- he's never shot at someone before -- then
takes a breath and starts shooting.
IN THE HELICOPTER
The bullets fly up from below. One hits Novacek. He slumps,
pushing the joystick to one side.
THE HELICOPTER
Starts to lean over sideways.
HALE
Is surprised -- it worked!'
TERRY
Watches in horror as...
THE HELICOPTER'S MAIN ROTOR BLADES
Angle toward her, slicing the air as the helicopter tips over.
36.
TERRY
Dives and rolls over the edge of the cliff as...
THE ROTOR BLADES
Hit the rock, sparking, grinding, right over Terry's head. The
blades stop dead. But the torque of the motor brings...
THE TAIL OF THE HELICOPTER
Up and over, in a high arc.
TERRY
Looks up.
THE TAIL --SECTION
Is swinging over fast and the tail rotor is coming right for her.
HALE AND TERRY
Hale runs up, grabs Terry, pulls her to her feet as...
THE TAIL SECTION
Swings down, rotor spinning. It digs into the dirt and sand a
split-second after...
HALE AND TERRY
Run clear.
Giles enters and is brought over to Wilkins.
GILES
Colonel Wilkins? I'm Giles
Prentice.
(they shake hands)
My word from your search and
rescue team?
WILKINS
No.
38.
GILES
I'm sorry. Picked up any
radiation?
Wilkins shakes his head.
GILES
That's kind of strange -- if
there's an exposed core out there.
WILKINS
Point?
GILES
Probably nothing. I asked for a
transcript of the last cockpit
transmission...?
Wilkins nods to a CORPORAL who hands some papers to Giles. Giles
reads them quickly.
WILKINS
I don't know what you expect to
find.
CU TRANSCRIPTS
We see COLONEL DEAKINS: "This is Deakins! Hale lost it! Oh,
God! I have to punch out!"
GILES
You know these guys? The pilots?
WILKINS
Just on the radio. Never met 'em.
Why?
GILES
(looks up)
What if this wasn't pilot error?
Baird has put Giles on speaker phone. The people in the
Situation Room exchange looks.
BAIRD
No rhetorical questions, Giles.
Spit it out.
39.
CROSSCUT WITH GILES IN MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM
GILES
In the last transmission from the
plane, Colonel Deakins said Major
Hale lost it and made the plane
crash. We all assumed that meant
pilot error. But what if Deakins
meant Hale made the plane crash.
Murmurs of "That's insane" "No way" fill the room.
BAIRD
Why would he do that?
GILES
Two nuclear weapons would be worth
a hell of a lot of money.
CHAIRMAN
To whom? Son, there are easier
ways for someone to buy nuclear
weapons. You go to one of the old
Soviet republics, you can get one
for the price of a BMW.
GILES
I meant they'd be worth a lot of
money to us. How much would we
pay to get them back? To make
sure they weren't used in this
country?
A flurry of looks around the room.
BAIRD
Hold on, hold on.
(to Creeley)
These nukes have codes or
something that prevent people from
using them.
CREELEY
Of course.
BAIRD
No one has these codes -- outside
of the President and you guys.
CREELEY
Access to the codes requires the
highest security --
BAIRD
I mean, not even the pilots have
these codes, right?
40.
Creeley starts to stammer. Baird slumps. The chairman turns.
CHAIRMAN
(to an assistant)
Where's that NEST team now?
ASSISTANT
They just took off.
SIX very serious-looking SOLDIERS are in black radiation suits,
listening to COLONEL HUNT, 45, over headsets.
HUNT
Listen up, sportsfans. Word is,
this particular broken arrow has
broken open. Our ETA Utah is
ninety-six minutes. I want
everyone to take that time to
triple-check the seams and seals
on their E-suits. Let's go!
Giles looks at Wilkins.
GILES
You think I'm nuts. You don't
think NEST or the satellite will
find anything weird.
WILKINS
That's right.
(BEAT)
But it wouldn't hurt to get some
gunships fueled just in case.
Wilkins reaches for a phone. Giles smiles.
Terry drives the Humvee into the mineshaft entrance. Hale uses
a flashlight to look around. He finds a switch a flips it. A
gas generator comes to life. Another click and lights come on.
Now they can see the rest of the entry area, including a wire-
mesh-enclosed elevator. As Terry looks around, Hale grabs the
Humvee radio, tries to tune in other frequencies, gives up.
HALE
They hardwired in their frequency.
We can't call out.
TERRY
What are we gonna do?
Hale goes to the back of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate.
HALE
I'm gonna take away Deakins'
reason for being here.
Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a
panel on the side of one of the B-83s.
47.
INSIDE PANEL
There's an LCD DISPLAY, a NUMERIC KEYPAD and a CLOCK showing the
current time. The keys are oversized and brightly colored.
TERRY
Fisher-Price makes nuclear weapons?
HALE
They're designed to be used by
guys wearing gloves in Alaska.
He reaches in, hits a key and the LCD display lights up.
HALE
These nukes have security codes.
If you enter the wrong code three
times, the nuke goes dead -- all
the circuitry shorts out and shuts
down. Kind of like the security
systems with car radios.
TERRY
And people say the public doesn't
benefit from defense spending.
HALE
(GRINS)
Hand me the radio.
Terry goes for the radio mike. Hale sees something.
A PLASTIC NAME TAG
Sticking out from under one of the nukes.
HALE
Pulls it out, looks at it.
ECU NAMETAG
It's from "St. Judes Hospital, Radiology Department."
HALE AND TERRY
Hale turns to Terry as she pulls over the radio mike.
HALE
Where's St. Judes Hospital?
The fire is out. The radio crackles.
HALE (V.0.)
Deak -- you there?
48.
Deakins and Kelly look at each other.
HALE (V.O.)
Ding, ding, ding, Deak. We're
starting a new round. You took
the first couple, but I've got you
on the ropes now, you son of bitch.
Deakins gets in the passenger side, grabs the radio mike.
DEAKINS
Hey, there. What was that last
part? There was some static.
(clicks off mike; to
JOHNSON)
Find them.
(to Pritchett and
KELLY)
Let's go!
Johnson pulls out a radiation detector scanner like the one
Rhodes used. Kelly and Pritchett get back in the vehicle.
CROSSCUT BETWEEN HALE AND DEAKINS
Kelly drives Deakins' Humvee along the trail as they talk.
HALE
I know you're stalling while you
try to find the nukes with your
scanner, but you're gonna be too
late. Hear that?
Hale holds the radio mike up to the keypad as he enters numbers.
HALE
I'm entering the wrong code, you
bastard. A couple more times and
these are gonna be useless to you.
DEAKINS
You really got me there. I sure
didn't think of that.
Hale slows down -- something's wrong -- Deakins doesn't cars.
DEAKINS
All that time we spent in the
cockpit together and you think I'm
stupid? I got some new boards and
circuits from a friend at Pantex.
But nice try.
Hale curses to himself. Terry looks at him. He shakes his head
they're in trouble.
49.
DEAKINS
You know, Hale, I thought of
asking you to join me on this. You
wanna know why I didn't?
HALE
Because I would've said no?
DEAKINS
I would've just killed you if you
said no. I was more afraid you'd
say yes. Because I knew I
couldn't count on you. You can
pretend you've got guts, but when
and if it comes down to it, you're
gonna run off crying like a little
girl.
HALE
You better hope that's true, Doak.
Because I've got the nukes, and
there's nothing to stop me from
entering the right code, if you
know what I mean.
DEAKINS
(flash of worry)
You wouldn't do that.
HALE
Nah. You're right. I wouldn't
have the guts.
END SPLIT-SCREEN. Hale drops the mike; looks at the elevator.
HALE
How deep is this mine?
TERRY
I don't know. A couple thousand
feet.
HALE
That's deep enough.
Hale opens the elevator gate.
TERRY
For what?
HALE
A nuclear explosion.
Terry's jaw drops.
50.
Kelly drives the blackened Humvee as fast as he can. Johnson
looks at his scanner, grins.
JOHNSON
Got it! They're --
DEAKINS
In the mine.
(off their looks)
I could tell he was inside
something. There was an echo.
Hale hurries to the back of the Humvee.
TERRY
We can still hide them!
HALE
He's got a scanner. He'd find
them.
TERRY
You're talking about setting off
a nuclear weapon!
HALE
They set them off underground in
Nevada all through the fifties and
sixties. There's no risk.
TERRY
Tell it to the two-headed cows.
Hale grabs the straps around one of the nukes, pulls. He can
barely move the thing. He turns to Terry.
TERRY
No! I am not helping you set off
a nuclear weapon.
HALE
We won't be down there when it
goes off. This isn't a suicide
mission.
TERRY
No!
51.
HALE
(IMPATIENT)
All right. Fine. Though I think
you should know, before I ejected,
I heard Deakins say the nukes were
going to be used to wipe out the
last few remaining handicapped gay
whales.
Terry looks at him -- you asshole. Hale looks at her, very
serious.
HALE
I need your help.
Terry thinks, shakes her head, steps up and grabs the nuke.
Hale and Terry are going down with the nukes.
HALE
When we get to the bottom we'll
have to get away from this shaft.
It'll limit the amount of
radiation released into-the
atmosphere.
Deakins, Pritchett, Kelly and Johnson wait by the elevator.
PRITCHETT
I can't wait to see how this fits
into your plan.
Deakins' charm peels away for an instant and he fixes Pritchett
with a stare. Pritchett shrinks back.
Baird, the Chairman and the others are watching large TV
monitors. Creeley walks them through what they're looking at.
ON THE MONITORS
A wide-view, bird's-eye, thermal image of rocky terrain.
CREELEY
This is the KH-12 satellite's
infrared view of the area. An
exposed nuclear core would be
relatively hot -- it'd show as a
circle of bright white. As you
can see, there's nothing. The
only heat signatures we found were
these.
The image changes. There are four blotches, glowing a dull red.
BAIRD
What's --?
CREELEY
We think it's Colonel Rhodes and
his men. Their bodies.
A look between Baird and the Chairman. The Chairman reaches for
a phone.
Wilkins is on the phone. Giles looks at him.
WILKINS
I understand, sir.
GILES
(WHISPERS)
Was I right?
Wilkins nods. Giles grins smugly for about half a second, then
realizes what it really means.
53.
GILES
Oh, shit.
WILKINS
(into phone)
I've got ten ships ready to go ...
We should be hearing from NEST any
minute now.
Deakins, Kelly and Johnson are in the elevator. Kelly holds a
small metal briefcase.
Hale and Terry have stopped at the end of a tunnel. Hale has
opened the guts of the nuke. He's pulling out a chip.
TERRY
How do you know how to do this?
HALE
Pilots who fly with nuclear
weapons have standing orders to ...
(quoting from the
MANUAL)
... "retrieve if possible, disable
if necessary and destroy if we
must," and destroy I must.
He stands, looks around. He sees...
EYEBOLTS
Screwed into the cross beaus on the ceiling.
HALE
I'm gonna need your belt and one
of your socks.
The elevator descends into view. Deakins, Kelly and Johnson get
out. They see the other nuke lying there.
KELLY
Send it up?
DEAKINS
(shakes head)
Let's take care of Hale first.
Spread out.
54.
In one hand Hale holds Terry's sock, filled with sand. His
other hand grips the eyebolt. Terry is giving Hale a log up,
straining under the weight.
TERRY
Take your time. Really.
Hale has pushed the open end of the sock through the eyebolt. He
tightens a belt around the open end of the sock.
HALE
Okay.
Terry lets Hale down. Hale picks up a big rock and loops the
free end of the belt around it. Then he picks up a smaller rock.
CLOSE ON NUCLEAR WEAPON
One chip has been pulled out of a circuit board. Hale very
gingerly lays the small rock on top of the chip.
HALE
We make a small hole in the sock,
and when enough sand drains out --
and we're hopefully in New
Mexico -- the sock is pulled
through the eyebolt, the rock
drops...
(re: smaller rock)
... hitting the rock on this chip,
closing the firing circuit and
that's it.
Hale finishes putting the small rock in position. He stands.
TERRY
How much time are we going to have?
HALE
I don't know precisely. This
isn't a Swiss sock. Ten minutes,
maybe --
Hale is cut off by...
BULLETS
Flying in, ricocheting off the rock walls, fired by...
JOHNSON
Thirty yards down the tunnel.
55.
HALE AND TERRY
Dive to the ground. They pull pistols, start shooting.
THE SOCK
One of Johnson's bullets cuts through it.
HALE
Feels sand hitting his face, looks up.
HIS POV
Sand is draining out of the sock very fast.
HALE AND TERRY
Reaches up to grab the big rock, but Johnson sends a spray of
bullets in. Terry grabs Hale.
TERRY
Come on!
HALE
The sock --
More bullets. Terry pulls Hale. They run down a side passage.
Hale and Terry fire back at Johnson as they run out of sight.
JOHNSON
Shoots after them, then runs up to the weapon. He reaches for
the rock, stops -- maybe that'll set it off.
THE SOCK
The last sand pours out; the sock is sucked through the eye-bolt.
THE ROCK
Drops fast toward the nuke.
A HAND
Grabs it, stopping it just in time. The hand belongs to...
DEAKINS
He looks at Johnson in disgust, exhales, and tosses the rock. He
pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on, talks into it.
56.
DEAKINS
We're at the end of tunnel three.
(clicks off; to
JOHNSON)
You two get this one set. I'll
take the other one up.
HALE AND TERRY
Running along a tunnel.
TERRY
What do we do?
HALE
Beat 'em back to the elevator.
Stop 'em from getting out.
Terry nods. They hurry off around a corner and are met by...
A FLURRY OF BULLETS
Fired by...
DEAKINS
With his Uzi.
HALE AND TERRY
Run back down the side tunnel, bullets winging off the rock all
around them, shooting back. Hale starts shooting out the
lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness.
DEAKINS
Slows down.
DEAKINS
The bit with the sock was good.
I like it. Still, I'm gonna use
the the Field Expedient Tactical
Timer. It's a little more precise.
(BEAT)
See, Hale -- you aren't the only
one who's thought of setting off
a nuke in this mine.
BY THE NUKE
Kelly is there with Johnson. Kelly flips on a lamp on a
headstrap, giving him better light as he opens up the metal
briefcase he's been carrying.
INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE
An elaborate electronic timer.
57.
IN THE TUNNELS
Deakins pulls out a fresh clip.
DEAKINS
I need a demonstration. Otherwise,
some swinging dick in Washington
is going to say I don't have the
balls or the ability to set off a
nuclear weapon. I'm gonna show
these puppies I'm ready, willing
and able. Hell, I'm eager.
Deakins jams in his clip, walks into the dark part of the tunnel.
HALE AND TERRY
In the dark, waiting to ambush Deakins and then...
DEAKINS
Opens fire -- but not at Hale and Terry -- at the cable along
the ceiling connecting the lights. The cable snaps and
electrical sparks shoot out, flooding the tunnel with light,
showing...
HALE AND TERRY
Suddenly exposed to Deakins' fire. The bullets whiz in.
DEAKINS
The muzzle flashes from his Uzi give away his position and Hale
and Terry's bullets scream in at him. He backs around a corner.
HALE AND TERRY
Take cover. It's a stand-off.
DEAKINS
Well, Hale, I better be going.
Look at it this way, partner. If
you wanted to get closer to God,
you are about to get your wish.
Hale hears Deakins' footsteps start off.
HALE
You're gonna ransom Salt Lake
City, aren't you?
The footsteps stop.
DEAKINS
What makes you think that?
58.
HALE
That's where St. Judes Hospital
is. You're gonna hide the nukes
near the radiology department so
they won't show up an any
satellite radiation scans.
DEAKINS
I'm impressed.
HALE
How much are you gonna ask for?
DEAKINS
Enough. I've got a broker in
Stockholm. Monday morning he's
going to buy me five percent of
Volvo. For the rest of my days
I'm going to live off the
dividends, happy in the knowledge
I'm helping to build the safest
car in the world.
HALE
So that's it? You're just doing
'this for the money? I'm kind of
disappointed.
DEAKINS
Why would you do it, Hale?
HALE
That's the thing -- I wouldn't.
DEAKINS
If you were me.
HALE
If I were you...?
(thinks, starts in)
Because ... because I got passed
over for promotion and goddamnit
I'm going to show the bastards
that I'm smarter than them all.
(getting angry)
Because ... everyone's selling out
and cashing in, so why not me?
(ANGRIER)
Because ... because my ex-wife was
sleeping around. Because my
parents abused me. Because I ate
some sugar.
(MORE)
59.
HALE (cont'd)
(FURIOUS)
Because I don't like Mondays.
(takes a breath,
GRINS)
It's all bullshit, Deak. There
are no reasons. Not really.
There's no difference between you
and the guy who shoots up the
schoolyard with an M-16. You both
think you have reasons. You both
think you were wronged. The
truth? You're both just fucked in
the head.
DEAKINS' FACE
Grim, evil -- fades into darkness as he turns and walks off.
HALE AND TERRY
They hear footsteps, receding. Hale bolts out of their hiding
spot. Terry follows.
Deakins gets to the elevator, drags the other nuke in, shuts the
gate and starts up.
Kelly finishes keying in numbers into the nuke timer. An amber
light comes on and...
THE TIMER
Starts ticking down from ton minutes.
KELLY AND JOHNSON
Grab their guns and run.
The elevator comes up. Deakins drags out the nuke, hits the
DOWN button, shuts the gate. The elevator descends.
DEAKINS
Mr. Pritchett!
Hale and Terry are waiting for the elevator to come down when...
KELLY AND JOHNSON
Run in. A half-second of surprise is broken when...
60.
THE ELEVATOR
Comes down.
HALE AND TERRY
Make a move toward the elevator, but...
KELLY AND JOHNSON
Unload with their Uzis.
HALE AND TERRY
Back around a corner, side by side, shooting their pistols.
JOHNSON
Is shot, drops.
KELLY
Grabs Johnson's Uzi and, firing both guns, backs to the
elevator, kicks open the gate with his foot and gets inside. He
hits the UP button with the butt of one of the guns and the
elevator starts to rise.
HALE AND TERRY
Step out of the tunnel and fire on the climbing elevator.
INSERT - ECU NUKE TIMER
Seven minutes and counting.
Deakins and Pritchett get the nuke into the back of the Humvee.
TERRY
We can go back, try to shut it
down.
HALE
We don't know the code, and Deak'd
have it wired to blow if we so
much as look at it funny.
TERRY
Then we're...
Hale looks at her.
61.
HALE
I'm sorry. I shouldn't've let you
come.
TERRY
Oh, God.
Hale takes Terry in his arms, holds her.
TERRY
I ... I just hope someone
remembers to feed my dog.
Hale nods, hugs Terry. Terry starts to say something else, but
Hale puts a finger to his lips -- he's heard something -- a
distant rushing.
HALE
Come on.
Hale pulls Terry, running, down the far tunnel.
TERRY
What're you --?
HALE
You said they shut down the mine
when they hit an underground river.
Deakins slams the tailgate on the Humvee shut. From the
distance, he and Pritchett hear the whump-whump-whump of a
helicopter. Deakins motions Pritchett to stay.
Hunt sees something, points.
HUNT
Ten o'clock! In the clearing!
HIS POV
The blackened Humvee and Deakins by the mine entrance.
62.
Hale and Terry run up. The tunnel comes to an end at a big
hole. The rushing sound comes from the hole. They step up
to the edge and look down.
THEIR POV
Dark water rushes by ten feet below them.
HALE
Any idea where it goes?
TERRY
No.
They look at each other. They don't have any choice. They
flick on their flashlights and jump. They-hit the water and are
swept from view.
Deakins enters, motions for Pritchett to get into the Humvee.
DEAKINS
Get in. We're leaving.
PRITCHETT
(re: Kelly and
JOHNSON)
Aren't you going to wait for them?
DEAKINS
No time. And if they get out,
they might talk. Fortunately,
there's something wrong with the
elevator.
Deakins opens fire with his Uzi on the generator. Sparks fly
and the thing shuts down.
Kelly is jarred when the elevator stops and the lights dim.
Kelly switches on his headlamp.
KELLY
Wrong person to screw with, Deak.
63.
He pulls open the gate and climbs down.
THE ELEVATOR SHAFT
Kelly swings under the elevator.
KELLY
I know the goddamn code, asshole.
He grabs the cable trailing off below the elevator and starts
sliding down it into the darkness.
INSERT - ECU NUKE TIMER
Two minutes and counting.
Hale and Terry are being sucked along through the fast,
turbulent water. Their flashlights show...
STALACTITES
Jutting down like knives, ready-to rip then open.
HALE AND TERRY
Dodge them, push off, duck under. And then they notice that...
THE CEILING
Is getting lower, getting closer to the surface of the water.
They're running out of breathing room. Three feet, two feet,
one foot. They take big breaths, maybe their last, and
they're...
UNDERWATER
Tumbling along, pulled at by the eddies, flashlights showing
their faces -- they are running out of air. And then, there's
light above them in the water.
HALE AND TERRY
Lungs bursting, they start kicking up.
Deakins drives fast along the 4WD trail, glancing in his
sideview mirror at...
64.
THE NEST HELICOPTER
Closing in on him.
PRITCHETT
Is holding on tight as Deakins drives wildly.
PRITCHETT
I think I've finally figured out
your plan. Those guys in the
helicopter are going to kill us,
but we're going to rise from the
dead and
DEAKINS
Very suddenly and very violently lashes out. The side of his
hand hits Pritchett in the throat.
PRITCHETT
Gags silently, suddenly unable to get any air. He pulls at his
throat, even pounds himself in the back of the neck. No go. He
slowly slumps, dying, skin turning blue.
DEAKINS
Maybe now you'll shut up.
Kelly is running as fast as he can, headlamp lighting the way.
INSERT - ECU NUKE TIMER
Thirty seconds and counting.
ECU NUKE TIMER
Eighteen seconds left.
KELLY
Runs up, starts entering numbers into the timer keypad.
The NEST helicopter closes fast on Deakins. They are a couple
hundred feet above him, a quarter mile back.
HUNT
Let him know we're here!
Deakins looks at...
THE TRIP ODOMETER
It clicks over from 2.9 to 3.0 miles.
DEAKINS
Grins, steps on the brakes.
ECU NUKE TIMER
Eleven, ten, nine...
KELLY
Punches in the last two numbers of the code then ENTER.
66.
ECU NUKE TIMER
It stops with seven seconds left. The amber light goes off and
the red light comes on.
KELLY
Sits back on the floor, takes a breath.
Kelly hears a click. He looks over at...
THE TIMER
The red light goes out. The amber light comes on. A splitsecond
later, the green light comes on.
KELLY
Oh shit.
The screen goes white.
There's a roar of static over everyone's headphones and then
every light, every piece of electronic equipment shuts down.
HUNT
No...!
They plummet.
Wilkins and Giles hear the sudden rumble and then the shockwave
hits, knocking stuff off desks, swinging lamps.
The lamps are still swinging.
GILES
That's all we need. A goddamn
earthquake.
WILKINS
Son, I was at the Nevada Test site
in the fifties. That wasn't an
earthquake.
Wilkins grabs a phone. Giles is pacing, freaked.
68.
WILKINS
(into phone)
Get me the Room.
GILES
I have to get out of here.
WILKINS
You're going to be fine. It was
underground.
(into phone)
Colonel Wilkins for General
Creeley.
GILES
How do you know?
WILKINS
For one thing, if it was above
ground, it wouldn't have caused
the same kind of ground tremor.
For another, if it was above
ground, we'd all be blind and
dying.
(into phone)
Sir, we've just had a detonation.
Bedlam. People yelling. The Chairman is huddling with Baird.
BAIRD
How'd that happen?
CHAIRMAN
I don't know, but thank God it
happened underground.
BAIRD
What do we do now?
CHAIRMAN
First thing we do is put a huge
goddamn lid on this thing. With
all due respect to your boy Giles
and his belief in honesty as the
best policy, from now on and until
the end of time, what happened in
Utah tonight was an earthquake.
All right?
Baird nods.
The zodiac boat is on the shore. Sheppard and four man -- call
them the GUNMEN -- are hauling the nuke to the truck. Deakins
walks with another man -- MAX, 50s. Max checks his watch.
74.
MAX
Your friends in Washington should
be getting the package about now.
DEAKINS
I wish I could see their faces.
Baird, the Chairman, Creeley and the others are all staring
slack-jawed at a TV screen.
ON THE TV
Camcorder shot of Deakins against a black backdrop.
DEAKINS
... two-hundred-and-fifty million
dollars, by nine a.m. Utah time.
The depositing instructions are in
the envelope that came with this
tape. This deadline is not
negotiable, and there is no grace
period. The device is on a timer.
Shortly after you receive this,
the timer will be activated. At
nine a.m., I will make a call. If
I find out you've done as you've
been told, I will stop the timer.
If you have not complied --
The screen suddenly cuts to a flurry of images of nuclear
destruction -- buildings being knocked sideways, mushroom
clouds, shockwaves, fires.
CHAIRMAN
Turn that off!
The back gate of the truck is shut from the inside. The truck
starts up and rumbles off, slowly at first.
TERRY
Jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck, staying right
behind. She grabs a handhold and pulls herself up. She holds
on tight as the truck bounces off down the dirt road.
75.
Loud voices and crosstalk. Baird is on the phone, nodding.
BAIRD
Yes, sir.
Creeley's phone rings. He answers it.
CREELEY
Creeley.
BAIRD
(covers phone; to
CHAIRMAN)
The President wants to know if we
know where the device is headed.
CHAIRMAN
If Deakins had a plane waiting, it
could be anywhere. We just don't
know.
CREELEY
I do.
(all eyes on him)
Major Hale is alive. According to
him, Colonel Deakins is headed for
Salt Lake City.
Wilkins is up front with the pilot. Hale and Giles are in back.
All wear headsets. Hale is yelling at Wilkins.
HALE
Deakins thinks I'm dead. He
thinks it's over. You've got to
let me go after him. I can help.
I know how his mind works.
WILKINS
Major, I know this is personal for
you, but I think we can handle it.
We're putting a wall of men and
machines around Salt Lake City as
we speak. That truck is not
getting through.
CLOSE ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
Dusty slices of light come through the truck's slatted walls.
The nuclear weapon is lashed to a hammock, straps running off to
D-rings on the sides. Max is hooking up an electronic timer.
HALE
What about the Ranger?
GILES
What about her?
HALE
When you find that truck, you'll
hit it hard. Chances are she'll
be killed in the crossfire.
"Regrettable but unavoidable."
77.
Giles and Wilkins share a look -- Hale is right.
HALE
Look, she's not supposed to be
there. She should be checking
camping permits, finding lost
kids. She...
(BEAT)
She saved my life.
Giles wants to help. So does Wilkins, but...
WILKINS
We were ordered to take you back
to McMurran. You understand what
orders are, don't you, Major?
Wilkins turns away. Hale sits back, mind racing, not knowing
what to do. He quickly grabs a pistol from the helicopter's
weapons rack and puts it to Wilkin's neck.
WILKINS
Major, put that away or say
goodbye to your career and hello
to twenty years in Leavenworth.
HALE
If that's what it takes.
WILKINS
You'll have to shoot me.
Hale thinks, but there's no way he can do that. He lowers the
gun, sits back.
Giles gets Hale's attention, then points to his own head. Hale
doesn't understand, so Giles grabs Hale's gunhand and puts the
gun up to his head.
GILES
Colonel! How about this?
Wilkins looks back, sees Hale holding the gun to Giles' head.
HALE
(bad acting)
I swear to God I'll shoot.
Wilkins grins.
Max finishes hooking up the timer. He looks at Deakins.
MAX
Ready when you are.
78.
DEAKINS
Wait until I get back. I'm going
to check on Sheppard.
Deakins goes to a ladder that leads up to the ceiling.
Hale is looking back and forth between what he sees out the
window and the map on his lap.
WILKINS
I don't know what you're looking
for, Major. Every road between
here and salt Lake has already
been sealed.
HALE
Deak would know that. Maybe he's
not on the road.
Wilkins doesn't understand.
HALE
They were using maps like these to
set up the roadblocks?
WILKINS
Yes...?
HALE
Then that's the answer.
Wilkins doesn't understand. Hale points outside, down at...
TRAIN TRACKS
On the ground. Old ones, half-covered by weeds.
HALE
It's an old spur. Probably hasn't
been used in twenty years. Nobody
bothered to put it on the new maps.
WILKINS
What are you --?
HALE
The nuke isn't in a truck,
Colonel. It's on a train.
Wilkins hangs up the radio mike.
WILKINS
Radio's still down. We'll head
north, look for a phone, then look
for a train.
Giles nods. Hale is thinking. Wilkins starts to tell the pilot.
HALE
No. Go south.
GILES
Salt Lake is north.
HALE
He's not going to Salt Lake.
GILES
But you said it would be Salt
Lake. You found that hospital tag.
HALE
He planted that. He wanted
whoever found it to think that's
where he was going.
(Shakes head)
He's been doing a rope-a-dope.
Giles and Wilkins look at him like he's nuts.
HALE
It's a boxing term. When Ali --
Look, I know this guy. If
everything has been saying he's
heading north, then he's heading
south.
They look at him, then Wilkins grabs the map.
WILKINS
What's south of here?
80.
ECU MAP
Wilkins' finger follows the train line on the map. It goes
right into Las Vegas.
HALE
No. Not Vegas. What the hell is
there to blow up in Vegas?
Wilkins' finger keeps moving on the map.
GILES
The President.
Wilkins' finger stops.
Sheppard is working with a torch, welding the brake and
accelerator controls. Deakins enters. Sheppard turns the torch
down. Deakins lights a cigarette off it.
DEAKINS
How much longer?
SHEPPARD
Almost done.
Behind the driver's compartment is the engine itself, with
walkways along either side.
TERRY
Creeps-up to one of the doors that lead into the driver's
compartment. She hears...
SHEPPARD (O.S.)
How long until the helicopter gets
here?
DEAKINS
Five minutes. We'll leave from
the boxcar roof.
81.
Deakins turns to go.
Deakins opens the door and strides along beside the engine.
TERRY
Is hiding on the other side of the engine, very quiet and still.
As Deakins goes out the back door of the engine, Terry follows.
Terry comes down the ladder from the hatch, followed by Deakins
with a gun.
DEAKINS
Terry, Max. Max, Terry.
MAX
(to Terry)
A pleasure.
(to Deakins)
What the hell is a "Terry" and why
is it still live?
DEAKINS
She asked me how I thought I was
going to get away with this and I
thought I'd tell her.
(to Terry)
We're going to a cabin in the
mountains, not far from here. When
we get there I'm gonna make two
phone calls.
(MORE)
82.
DEAKINS (cont'd)
The first is to the Pentagon. I'm
gonna tell them where the train
is.
(GRINS)
See, all their forces are up at
Salt Lake by now. By the time
they could get a F-15 down here
the train will be on the outskirts
of Vegas. And I'll remind them
about the impact trigger -- if
they hit this train hard, the
nuke'll blow.
(shakes head)
They won't have any choice.
They'll have to let the train get
into the city and because of that,
they'll have to pay.
TERRY
You said two phone calls.
DEAKINS
The second will be to my bank in
Geneva. If the money's in my
account, I use this...
(pulls out what looks
like a modified cell-
PHONE)
... and shut down the timer. If
not, we sit back, put on some
shades and get a quick tan.
TERRY
But -- radio isn't working.
DEAKINS
You saw the dish on the roof?
Microwave. It's not affected by
EMP. See? I really have thought
of everything.
MAX
You kept her alive just so you can
impress her with how smart you are?
DEAKINS
(to Max)
No, I kept her alive because I
want her to do me a favor. See,
if something goes wrong and this
thing goes off, a half a million
people are going to be vaporized.
I don't want that on my
conscience. So I'm not going to
arm the nuke.
(MORE)
83.
DEAKINS (cont'd)
(puts gun to Terry's
HEAD)
She is.
The room is silent. Everyone is looking at video monitors
showing a map of Las Vegas. They are listening to a nervous
ASSISTANT as he uses a telestrator to diagram the blast effects.
AIR FORCE ASSISTANT
Starting at ground zero and moving
out, we have, in terms of
immediate effect, one hundred
percent fatalities to thirty
miles. Ninety percent from thirty
to forty miles, dropping roughly
ten percent for every-ten miles
after that. The long term --
CHAIRMAN
(cut to the chase)
Son?
AIR FORCE ASSISTANT
(looks up, seared)
Two hundred and fifty thousand in
the first few seconds. The same
again within a year.
BAIRD
(it sinks in)
Good God.
Terry is shaking, tears in her eyes, as she slowly-enters the
numbers Deakins tells her to in the nuke timer keypad.
DEAKINS
Nine ... Then pound ... Good. Now
six ...
ECU TERRY'S EYES
Filled with tears. She blinks and...
QUICK CUTS
Terry has visions of RETIREES in Vegas, watering potted plants
outside their motor home, of TEENAGERS ragging on each other as
they walk to school, of CHILDREN in a playground.
DEAKINS
Seven ... Star ... One...
84.
And Terry shakingly pushing each button and then...
The images of the retirees, the teenagers and the children each
bleach out to white, fast, as if hit by a nuclear blast.
DEAKINS
Then ENTER and it's done.
TERRY
Her finger hovers over the ENTER button, almost pushes it, then
shifts to CANCEL and pushes that.
ECU NUKE TIMER
The display goes blank.
DEAKINS
Stunned. He shakes his head.
DEAKINS
Ooh. You really shouldn't have
done that. I said I would kill
you, and I will.
TERRY
I'm gonna be dead either way. I
don't want any part of this.
Deakins shrugs -- he sees her logic. He puts his gun to Terry's
head. Terry shuts her eyes.
DEAKINS
Night-night.
Deakins is about to pull the trigger when Max stops him. Max
gestures -- listen. They hear a helicopter approaching. Max
checks his watch.
DEAKINS
They're early.
Just then, they hear gunfire. Max gives Deakins a look.
DEAKINS
It's not a problem. Set the
timer, then kill her. Have fun
with it.
Deakins starts climbing up the ladder to the hatch.
Max holds a pistol on Terry with one hand while he quickly sets
the timer with the other.
TERRY'S HAND
Rests on Max's tool tray. Her fingers creep over to a vrench.
MAX
Presses ENTER and finishes setting the timer.
MAX
There.
TERRY AND MAX
Terry swings hard and fast with the wrench, knocking the gun out
of Max's hand. Max spins, and when Terry swings at him again.
Max kicks the wrench out of her hand, then steps up fast and
hits Terry under the chin with the heel of his hand. She drops
straight back.
MAX
Thought I was just friendly old
Max, huh? Lady, I was a Navy SEAL.
You should see what I can do with
just my thumb.
Max goes for his gun.
TERRY'S HAND
Grabs onto something. It's the wrench.
TERRY AND MAX
As Max turns back with the gun, Terry heaves the wrench. It
hits Max square in the forehead. He drops like a rock.
TERRY
Yeah? Well, you should see what
I can do with just a chicken.
Wilkins and Hale are returning fire. Hale points at Deakins.
HALE
That's him!
86.
WILKINS
(to pilot)
Get him!
PILOT
They've got guns!
WILKINS
You've got a helicopter. Use it!
Terry comes into the driver's compartment. She tugs at the
brake and accelerator levers. It's useless. She looks around,
spots a cigarette lighter.
Deakins and the one remaining GUNMAN hear the helicopter. They
start toward the ladder to the roof hatch when they hear
footsteps on the roof of the car. Deakins gestures to the
gunman. He raises his gun, trying to figure out where to shoot.
Then they hear someone tugging at the hatch handle. The gunman
opens fire on the hatch.
The gunman hears a sound, starts to turn, just as...
HALE
Swings into the boxcar on the cable, firing the shotgun.
THE GUNMAN
Is picked up by the blast and smashed back through the wood slat
wall of the boxcar and out of the train.
DEAKINS
Climbs up fast through the hatch to the roof.
HALE
Shoots at Deakins, misses. The shotgun clicks empty. Hale
tosses the gun then unhooks the cable from the harness. He
drops to the floor-of the boxcar and runs to the ladder.
Hale gets to his feet, goes to look at the nuke.
ECU NUKE TIMER
Five minutes and counting.
HALE
Looks at it, trying to figure out how to disarm it. He hears
the whoosh-thump of someone jumping down into the boxcar. He
turns.
DEAKINS
Stands there, trying to smile, trying to be cool, but...
DEAKINS
They would've paid and I would've
stopped it. You've made a very,
very big mistake.
HALE
It's over, Deak. I beat you.
Disarm it.
93.
DEAKINS
If it's over and you beat me, you
disarm it.
HALE
Deak...
DEAKINS
Course you are going to need this.
(holds cell-phone
REMOTE)
All you have to do is get it.
(puts remote in
POCKET)
And if you do, as a special added
bonus, you get this.
Deakins pulls out...
THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
Then pockets it.
HALE AND DEAKINS
Share a look. Deakins puts up his fists.
DEAKINS
Ready?
Hale puts up his fists.
Hale and Deakins circle each other.
DEAKINS
Modern boxing is a pussy sport.
They want to make it about scoring
points. It's not about scoring
points! It's about this!
94.
Deakins fakes a right, jabs with his left, catching Hale on the
chin. Hale is jarred. Blood runs from his mouth.
DEAKINS
Okay. You're bleeding. Good. In
the old fights, there'd be so much
blood, guys would slip and fall.
Let's see if we can't get a little
more of that red goo out of you.
Ready?
Again Deakins fakes right, jabs left. Hale half blocks it, but
is sent back.
DEAKINS
Used to be, every fight was to a
knockout. You know what happens
when you get knocked out? It's
your brain slapping against the
inside of your skull. Here. I'll
let you see what it's like. Ready?
Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins
swings. Hale ducks, comes up hard with all he's got, gets
Deakins under the chin and Deakins sails up and back, landing
prone, seeing stars.
HALE
Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light of the hatch above
him. And then...
Hale is thrown off his feet.
95.
THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
Swings wildly in the hammock webbing.
THE STRAPS
Securing the webbing to the walls of the car start to snap.
Hale tries to get to his feet, but then the floor starts
dropping below him as...
Flickering light from a burning Toyota comes in through the
slatted walls. In this weird light, Hale sees...
THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
It's above him, at the end (top) of the car. It's hanging in
mid-air, tangled up in the webbing. Two straps are the only
things keeping the nuclear weapon from dropping twenty feet to
the bottom of the car.
DEAKINS
Is lying at the bottom (end) of the car, directly under the
nuke, not moving.
HALE
Looks around for something. He sees it --
DEAKINS' REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE
On the floor.
96.
DEAKINS' EYES
Flicker open. He sees...
A PISTOL
Lying a few feet away.
HALE
DEAKINS (O.S.)
You have to push amber, then red.
You might have time to push amber.
You won't get to red.
Hale turns to see...
DEAKINS
Pointing a gun at him.
HALE
The nuke is armed, Deak. If it
falls, the impact trigger will set
it off.
DEAKINS
I know.
HALE
Half a million people will die.
DEAKINS
(thinks, shrugs)
Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
ONE OF THE STRAPS
Holding the nuke tears through. One strap left.
HALE
His finger hovers over the amber button.
DEAKINS
Do it and I shoot.
Hale looks at Deakins.
HALE
I guess you really don't know me
that well after all.
Hale presses the amber button.
97.
DEAKINS
Shoots.
HALE
Spins back, blood spraying from his shoulder.
THE REMOTE
Falls from his hand.
DEAKINS
Is about to shoot again, then hears a tearing and looks up as...
THE LAST STRAP
Rips through and...
THE NUKE
Drops toward him, point first.
HALE'S BLOODY HAND
Grabs the remote and his finger presses the RED button.
ECU NUKE TIMER
Mid-air, dropping, the clock and display go blank as...
DEAKINS
His eyes fill with true terror as...
THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
Punches into Deakins, point first, crushing him.
HALE
Gets to his feet and stands over Deakins. He reaches down,
opens Deakins' pocket and pulls out the twenty-dollar bill.
HALE
Ready.
He heads out of the boxcar.
