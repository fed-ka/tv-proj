
      Wisps of fog dot the ground.  Ten silent and determined men  (X)
      search the earth, the beams of their flashlights strange 
      glowing pillars that seem to spring from nothingness.  Half 
      the men guide hi-tech metal detectors over the dirt; they're 
      led by GENE NEWTRICH, 50.  He has the look of a man who's 
      spent his life outdoors.  Suddenly, Gene's detector gives a 
      BEEP.  He makes a hand signal and all the others congregate 
      around.  He's handed a shovel and begins to dig Hard.
      Fast.  Precise.  There's a CLUNK as the shovel strikes
      something.  Gene drops to his knees.  His gloved hands probe
      the soil, grasp the object and pull it up.  A GLOWING RED
      ROCK, the size of an orange, illuminates his face.  Gene
      looks at the rock in wonder.

      LOIS and CLARK walk to work together, sipping cappucinos, a
      slightly awkward air between them.  A van marked "SPEEDY
      PAYROLLS" passes and parks in front of the Daily Planet.
      Clark finally asks the question he s been dying to ask.      (X)

                                 CLARK
                So, how was your ice cream date
                with Agent Scardino?

                                 LOIS
                       (avoiding him)
                Now there's my favorite sight in
                the whole world: the truck that
                delivers our payroll checks.

                                 CLARK
                Okay, if you don't want to talk                    (X)
                about it, I understand.                            (X)

                                 LOIS
                It was... okay.  I had chocolate,                  (X)
                he ordered Rocky Road.                             (X)

                                 CLARK

                                 LOIS

                       (quickly)
                Lots of things. And at least he                    (X)
                stuck around long enough to have a                 (X)
                conversation, unlike some people I                 (X)
                know who are always running off!                   (X)

                                 CLARK

                                 PAYROLL GUARD (V.O.)
                Help!  Police!

      Clark and Lois look to see three armed and HOODED MEN (one
      of whom is Gene), attacking the PAYROLL GUARD as he unloads
      a large box of checks from his van.  A Chevy Suburban with
      blacked out windows idles next to it.

                                 CLARK
                I'll call the cops!

      Clark dashes away.                                           (X)

                       (to anybody who'll
                        listen)
                Hey! Help!  They're robbing that
                truck!

      One Hooded Man holds down the Guard as the other two load    (X)
      boxes of checks into the Suburban.  Whoosh!  Her hair gets
      blown as SUPERMAN appears next to her.

                                 SUPERMAN
                Don't worry, Lois, they'll be in
                jail before you can say
                'cappucino'.

      He runs out of frame in a BLUR.


   6  ANGLE ON HOODED MEN                                         6   

      Whoosh!  Superman arrives.  They turn in surprise.

                                 SUPERMAN
                I'm afraid you'll have to take a
                raincheck on those checks, boys.

                                 GENE (HOODED)
                       (nervous)
                Really? What if we don't want to?

      With one hand low to his side, he makes a signal.  Inside
      the back of the Suburban, behind Superman, ANOTHER HOODED
      THUG, opens a box, exposing the red Kryptonite.

      almost casual.

                Oh... maybe nothing.  I mean,

                so... what do I care?

      They all jump into the Suburban and speed off.  Lois runs up 
      to Superman.

                                 LOIS
                Superman, you let them get away!

                                 SUPERMAN
                No big deal, Lois.  Most criminals 
                are repeat offenders.  I'll 
                probably catch then again later.

                                 LOIS
                What?!

                                 SUPERMAN
                And if I don't, well... 'que sera,

      He gently FLOATS up into the air, then ZOOMS out of sight.

      Lois and Clark walk through the newsroom on their way to 
      Perry's office.

                                 LOIS
                So the red Kryptonite made Superman 
                completely apathetic and his 
                attitude wore off on you?

                                 CLARK
                Actually, I was trying to put
                myself in Superman's shoes to get a
                better understanding of what he was
                going through.

                                 LOIS
                Well, you did a great job.

      They enter Perry's office.                                   (X)
