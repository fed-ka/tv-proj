                     My name is Sam Tyler. I had an 
                    accident and I woke up in 1973. Was 
                    I mad? In a coma? Back in time? 
                    Whatever had happened, it was like 
                    I d landed on a different planet. 
                    If I could figure out why I was 
                    here then maybe I could get home 
                    ...  Yeah, whatever. That is so
                    lame.

                    Part of growing up is knowing when

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Hassled OFFICERS keep back a nervous crowd of ON-LOOKERS.

      ARTHUR LAYTON is middle-aged and down at heel with a scar 
      across his left cheek. He has a petrified BUSKER hostage. Gun 
    to her head. 

      ALEX pushes through the ON-LOOKERS. Tate Modern dominates the 
      skyline one side and the gleaming city dominates the other.

                                  POLICE SERGEANT
                    Arthur Layton. He took her money. 
                    She put up a fight. He pulls a 
                    ruddy gun! 

      LAYTON S eyes are constantly searching the concourse - 
      desperate for a means of escape.

      ALEX moves closer.

                                  POLICE SERGEANT (CONT'D)
                    Wait for armed backup.

                                  ALEX
                    Don t need it. 

    She bares her jacket - revealing to LAYTON that she wears no 
      holster. The SARG rolls his eyes - give me strength. 

      MOLLY hurries up. Loiters anxiously at the back of the crowd, 
      unnoticed.

      LAYTON is amazed as ALEX approaches. He s clearly desperate 
    but there s an underlying intelligence in him.

                                  LAYTON
                    Stop! This is my show!

      MOLLY turns at the sound of clattering feet - THREE POLICE 
      MARKSMEN are charging down the concourse carrying state-of-

                                  ALEX
                    Let her go and we ll talk.

                                  LAYTON
                    I just wanted cash. You lot turned 
                    this into a three-ringed circus!

                                  ALEX
                    I help people who are trapped. I 
                    help them find an escape route.

      MOLLY panics as she watches the MARKSMEN angling around the 
      crowd to take up position. Laser-sights snapped on.

                                  LAYTON
                    I don t like people staring at me.

                                  ALEX
                    That s fine. I m averting my eyes. 
                    If you let her go, we can 
                    discuss...

                                  LAYTON
                    I ll kill you. Don t doubt it.

      ALEX smiles at LAYTON - it s a smile you can trust.

                                  ALEX 
                    I m not asking you to give up your 
                    hostage. I know that s important to 
                    you. But take me instead.

                                  LAYTON
                    I dunno ... This is my show.

                                  ALEX
                      Absolutely. 

      LAYTON pushes the relieved BUSKER away. Switches the gun to 
      ALEX S face.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Smart move. Good for you Arthur.

    She takes another step closer. 

                                  LAYTON 
                    Wait! I .. I know you! Can t be ... 
                    The last time I saw you, you were

    She comes out of nowhere. Breaking through the cordon before 
    the SERGEANT can reach her.

      MOLLY runs towards ALEX with THE DOTS OF THREE LASER-SITES 
      DANCING ON HER BACK.

                                  ALEX
                    DON T SHOOT!! THERE S A CHILD!!

      Panic. ON-LOOKERS start screaming. A laser site skips across 
      ALEX S face as she reaches for MOLLY.

      Confusion. MARKSMAN S trigger finger itches.

      ALEX reaches to grab MOLLY. Another hand gets there first. 
      LAYTON. He pulls MOLLY to his chest. Backs away towards the 
      river.

    The MARKSMEN don t know what to do. Both LAYTON and MOLLY are 
      smothered in laser light. 

      LAYTON drags MOLLY down the steps towards the riverside 
       beach . The MARKSMEN inch forward. ALEX can t stand it - 
      runs towards the steps just as MOLLY rushes into her arms.

      OFFICERS blaze past them but the beach already seems 
      deserted.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    if you learn to trust me, I can 
                    help you get through it.

    She strokes MOLLY S hair.

      A good-looking man in late middle-age walks towards them 
      cautiously. Kind eyes. Expensive clothes. An aura of strength 
    and civility. This is EVAN WHITE.

                                  MOLLY
                    Evan!

    She almost throws herself into his hug.

    He looks over at ALEX and mouths,  you okay?  She nods with a 
      grateful smile and ushers him on his way. He tips her a wink 
    and leads MOLLY away.

                                  EVAN (CONT'D)

      LAYTON sits up in the back seat and rests his gun against the 
      back of her neck. He puts on reflective sunglasses.

                                  LAYTON
                    Start the car.

      LAYTON pushes ALEX along a rusted gangplank towards the 
      flaking hulk. The horizon across the river is dominated by 
    the Millennium Dome.

    She is ignored.

      ALEX fingers her red clothes, noticing them for the first 
      time. What the hell ..?

      Into the street charges EDWARD MARKHAM. He has been one of 
    the punters in the brothel. Brash. Young. Bouffant highlights 
      that bounce as he moves. Striped shirt under an expensive 
      jacket. Coke powder around his nose. Harrow school in manner 
    and accent.

    He pushes her against the wall. She is too shell-shocked to 
      resist.

                                  MARKHAM 
                    You ll regret that sweetie.

    An AudiQuattro screams into the alley. Heads directly 
      towards a stack of dustbins.At the last second it swerves to 
      avoid them. Brakes inches from ALEX and MARKHAM.

      Three men emerge. DS RAY CARLING - pink Fred Perry t-shirt, 
      aviators. DC CHRIS SKELTON - two-tone drainpipes and a wedgie 
      haircut. 

      DETECTIVE CHIEF INSPECTOR GENE HUNT - silvery grey suit over 
      a crisp white shirt. Tie hung low and sulky.

                    the mental trigger to get me out of 
                    here. Okay?

                                  CHRIS
                    Roger that. 
                          (beat)
                    I m not nervous. I m cautious.

                    Can I help you love or are you 
                    looking for business?

    She turns. And there he is. Right there before her. LAYTON! 
      Still wearing the Scary Monster t-shirt.No scar on his face 
      though.

                                                                        SMASH CUT:

                                  LAYTON
                    What?

                                  ALEX
                    Chris, cuff him. Do it!

                                                                            CUT TO:


      ALEX barges the door open and walks through the yard. LAYTON 
    is shining up an antique sabre. He glances up.

                                  ALEX
                    I m going to stop you, you bastard!  

                                  LAYTON
                    I don t like people looking at me. 

                                  ALEX
                    Why? What are you afraid of?

                                  LAYTON
                    I m not afraid. Are you? 

    He heads towards his shop, allowing the sabre to scrape 
      horribly along the hard stone ground. 

                                  LAYTON (CONT D)
                    You should be Miss Drake. There s a 
                    lot to be afraid of here.

                                  LAYTON
                    But who s gonnaget you, in the 
                    end?

    He slams the shop door on her. Gone. She backs away. And it 
    is then that she notices a tatty notebook sitting beside 
      Layton s chair in the yard. She picks it up and flicks 
      through it - lists of numbers - 0527 / 1844.

      Something moves in the corner of ALEX s eye. She turns with a 
      start: the ASHES CLOWN?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      ALEX steps into the deserted street. The ASHES CLOWN stands 
      fifty yards away. Fixed. Still. Looking at her. 

    And then quite suddenly he starts to run full pelt towards 
      her. ALEX turns and flees in panic. The CLOWN is gaining.

      Fury seizes her. She stops and whirls to face him.

                                  ALEX
                    Go AWAY!

    But the street is empty again. ALEX suddenly hates this 
      place. Hates this bloody red skirt. She starts tearing at it 
      angrily.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CHRIS and SHAZ in a Ford Fiesta. CHRIS sports his aviators, 
      sausage roll wedged in his mouth. SHAZ jumps back in the car 
      beside him, nervous but a bit excited.

                                  SHAZ
                    I should be in uniform.

                    No time for that. I have to nail 
                    Layton now. Crime squad gave us the 
                    drop-point for Markham s messages, 
                    you at it?

                                  CHRIS
                    Yes. 

                                  ALEX (RADIO)
                    Message in place?

      CHRIS spies the envelope taped to the wall opposite. Grins at 
      SHAZ who gives the big thumbs up. 

                                  CHRIS
                    Shaz has just set it up.

                                  ALEX
                    If Markham takes the bait...

                                  CHRIS
                    He ll read the fake message to meet 
                    at Layton s place. We follow him.

                    Roger that ma am. 

    He clicks off the radio. Shifts in his seat.

                                  CHRIS (CONT D)
                    I need a jimmy riddle.

    He dives out of the car. SHAZ puts on her newly acquired 
      Walkmanand checks her lipstick in the rear-view mirror, 
      humming  Tainted Love  to herself.

    She doesn t notice the dark car that pulls up further down 
    the road.

      A car crammed with BIG GEEZERS.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      SHAZ finishes with her lipstick. A hand taps on the car 
      window, SHAZ winds it down as MARKHAM leans in grinning.

                                  MARKHAM
                    Think you ll find that Walkman s
                    mine sweetie.

      Across the street: CHRIS returns to see SHAZ dragged from the 
      Fiesta by some nasty looking GEEZERS crammed into suits. 
      MARKHAM is with them, standing out a mile in pastel shades 
    and highlights.

                                  CHRIS
                    Shaz! SHAZZER!!

                                  SHAZ
                    Don t hurt me .. Chris ..?!!

      CHRIS runs forward but is met by a blow to the stomach. He 
      sags to his knees.

                                  MARKHAM
                    Did I spoil your little plan? 
                    Secret notes and special meeting 
                    points? This some feeble idea of 
                      entrapment.

                                  CHRIS
                    Leave her ...

      MARKHAM gives him a kick in the ribs. SHAZ screams.

                    little corporate insurance, just to 
                    make sure the deal runs smoothly. 

      They drag SHAZ to the car.

                    Shaz ....

    The car tears away. CHRIS punches the ground in tearful 
      frustration.

      cars screeching up. UNIFORM spilling out along with CID. GENE

      GENE, RAY and CHRIS move into position behind some stacks of 
      concrete. GENE peeks around the side of the blocks and 
      squints through binocs.

      POV: MARKHAM supervising the unloading of several crates. His 
    men carry machine-guns.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      ALEX scans the water with her binocs.She can see distant

                    I need Layton alive. Understand? I

      GENE watches from hiding. A big car draws up. MARKHAM goes to 
    the window which glides down in anticipation. MARKHAM talks 
    to the hidden man within the car.

      MARKHAM beckons a COHORT who brings SHAZ into view. SHAZ is 
      dishevelled and trembling. 

      CHRIS S blood boils. He goes to step out, gun raised. GENE 
      holds him back.

      MARKHAM cracks open a crate and removes a kilo bag. Passes it 
      into the car. Laughter from the man within the car. He steps 
      out. We see it s LAYTON, looking every inch the 80 sdrug 
      dealer in his sub-Miami Vice suit.

      GENE S eyes burn with a hellish indignation. 

      MARKHAM is really enjoying himself. His GANG congregate 
      around the coke crate, laughing and pushing each other. SHAZ 
    is ignored.

      ALEX and the other OFFICERS hear the distant report of gun-
      fire further down the bank. This is it! ALEX follows the 
      action through her binocs.

      GENE and RAY are pinned down.

      CHRIS can see MARKHAM moving back near to SHAZ. CHRIS makes a 
      break for it, bullets snapping at his heels. He dives behind 
      a second concrete stack. It s no use, he can t get close 
      enough.

      LAYTON suddenly grabs SHAZ as hostage. He pulls her towards 
    his car as the others get in.

      GENE sees this. Stands up and SHOOTS THE CAR. THE BONNET 
      FLIES UP IN A BURST OF SMOKE AND FLAMES. The GANG MEMBERS
      scatter, throwing their guns aside.

                    B-Team to A-Team. Do you read me?

      ALEX starts off along the quay-side. Alone. 

    She comes face to face with LAYTON and SHAZ! LAYTON draws 
      SHAZ to him and puts the gun to her head.

    She makes a point of not staring at him.

      CHRIS stands to one side and RAY takes a position at the

      ALEX raises her gun to LAYTON.

                    You re under arrest for drug-

      ALEX cocks her trigger. LAYTON cocks his, ramming the gun 
      against SHAZ S head.

                                  SHAZ (CONT'D)
                    Oh Jesus and Joseph!

      GENE is blazing a stare from the boat.

                                  ALEX
                    I m stopping you. This is not your

                                  LAYTON
                    Nobody stares at me ...

                    NOBODY STARES AT ME!!

      LAYTON pushes SHAZ away. 

      GENE opens fire. RAY and CHRIS follow suit.

    THE TOW-PATH EXPLODES WITH BULLETS THAT PICK AT THE GROUND.

      ALEX dives back and covers SHAZ with her own body. A bullet 
      ricochets into LAYTON S face. He grabs his bloody cheek and 
      falls to the ground.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        Ashes to Ashes - Episode 1 - Shooting Script: PEACH - 31/08/07           57.

      ALEX crawls to him. Cuffs him. LAYTON is dazed and bleeding 
    but relatively unhurt.

                                  ALEX
                    You told me you had an empire going

    She looks to the sky. Nothing. ALEX sags - utterly drained. 
    She realizes that LAYTON is staring at her with dark boiling 
      hatred.

      GENE, RAY and CHRIS jump get out of the boat. CHRIS catches 
      sight of MARKHAM trying to leg it away from the river. CHRIS 
      gives chase.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      MARKHAM reaches a dead-end. Turns. Defiant. CHRIS aims his 
      pistol.

                    Don t make me laugh. There are

      CHRIS fires. MARKHAM S espadrille explodes in a geyser of 
      blood.

                                  MARKHAM
                    You shot my bloody toes off!

    The drug GANG are bundled into Rover Squad cars, including a 
      limping MARKHAM. OFFICERS clap and pat each other on the

      CHRIS approaches SHAZ who has a blanket around her.

                    What?

    She suddenly hugs him fit to bust.

    RAY looks over and sees GENE and ALEX walking towards them. 
    Two cops - stride for stride. GENE has the machine-gun slung 
      Dirty Dozen style over his shoulder. ALEX lets her pistol 
      hang casually at her side.

                                  ALEX
                    What was that? In the boat? with
                    the machine-gun? Was that you being 
                     cool ?

                    You may have stopped me getting

                    Listen Bollyknickers, you were a 
                    second from death just now. It s a

                    you just might get through it. 

      They have stopped to face each other. Nose to nose. Ego to 
      ego. 

      RAY, CHRIS and SHAZ watch them and they can all see it - the 
      spark between GENE HUNT and ALEX DRAKE.

                                  RAY
                    Oh no.

                    I had a plan. I wanted to go home.

                    Well your presence is required a

      ALEX marches angrily towards the car. She pauses at SHAZ 
      still wrapped in her blanket.
