          END OF "QUALITY OF LIFE" MOBBED BY REPORTERS - (ANGLE
          MUST SEEM LIKE NEWS CAMERA FOOTAGE)

                                        FAN MAN (V.O.)
                        There's no doubt in my mind  Johnny
                        Smith is the real thing...

          A TV MONITOR

          the nerdy Johnny expert from "Unreasonable Doubt"

                        ...perhaps even the next link in
                        the chain of human evolution.


          AS WE MOVE BACK WIDER FROM THE TV SCREEN, MORE OLD CLIPS
          (THAT HAVE TO APPEAR TO BE NEWS FOOTAGE) OF JOHNNY WITH
          REPORTERS, I.E. "THE SIEGE", "DESTINY", "VALLEY", ALSO
          PERHAPS THE MAILROOM AT FAITH HERITAGE AND TOURISTS OUTSIDE
          HIS GATES ("DESTINY")...

                                        TV REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Smith has retreated from public
                        view since his recent abduction...
                        but that hasn't stopped his growing
                        legion of fans from bombarding
                        the Faith Heritage Alliance with
                          requests for his services... and
                        the Maine Tourist Bureau reports
                        that Cleaves Mills is rapidly
                          becoming a vacation destination...

          Our move reveals that we are in --


  33INT. BRUCE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          (As shot for "Valley")





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - TEASER - 12/9/02 GRN    2.

                                        TV REPORTER (O.S., CONT'D)
                        ...as looky-loos arrive from across
                        New England, hoping for a glimpse
                        of the reclusive soothsayer... 

          Moving back to find Bruce on the couch with a very
            affectionate girl snuggling up against him... in fact, we
          may recognize Stillson's volunteer girl KATIE...

                        KATIETV REPORTER (O.S.)
              What's he really like?Our own prognosticator,
                                                        Dr. Tom is up next with
                          BRUCEthe weather... be careful,
                (shakes his head atTom, John Smith knows if
                all this)it's going to rain or shine
            I'll tell you what he'sbetter than your
            not.  He's not the nextbarometer...
            link in the evolutionary
              chain.

          He watches the TV set with disdain, worried about Johnny...

                                        BRUCE
                        He's... just a guy.  Just Johnny
                        Smith.   


  44INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

          Johnny sits alone at the head of his long dining table
          drinking a cup of coffee, reading something on his
            laptop... nothing but the ticking grandfather clock to
          keep him company... 

          Alone like Charles Foster Kane...  Like Elvis...

          The doorbell sounds.  Johnny looks up...  


  55INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Using his flat-screen TV's remote control, Johnny brings
          up the view from the security camera on his gate.  It's
          RAUL (17, Hispanic), the grocery boy, arms full of
          groceries.  Johnny is relieved, even happy to see him.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (into intercom)
                        Hey, Raul!  Hang on, I'm clicking
                        you in.

          Johnny pushes the button releasing the gate.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - TEASER - 12/9/02 GRN    3.


    5CONTINUED:5

          MOVING WITH HIM to the kitchen door where he releases the
          security alarm by pressing a sequence of five numbers...
          then unhooking a deadbolt or the latest equivalent of
          serious locks... to let Raul in...

          And we may notice that Johnny is engaging the delivery
          man more than you or I might... like he's appreciating
          the company... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        How ya doin', Raul. 

                                        RAUL
                        Fine, Mr. S.

          He carries in the bags, lays them on the kitchen counter...

                                        JOHNNY
                        So.  How're things down at the
                        store?

                                        RAUL
                        Got this whole new organic fruit
                        and vegetable department, you
                        ought to come down, check it out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can I get you a beer or something?

                                        RAUL
                        Ah, wish I could, Mr. S... I got
                        other deliveries...

          Johnny's disappointed the kid has to rush off...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Keeping you busy, huh?

                                        RAUL
                        Hey, we got in that H agen-Dazs
                        butter pecan you like... we should
                        put it in the freezer...

          He starts to take a few items out of the bag in search of
          the ice cream bag... one of the items is a jar of capers...










                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - TEASER - 12/9/02 GRN    4.


  5CONTINUED: (2)5

                                        RAUL
                        Oh yeah and I found your missing
                          capers... they put it in the wrong
                        bag last week... went to another
                        address... old man named Grissom,
                          a shut-in... guy never wants me
                        to leave... like I really have
                        time to play chess with him, you
                          know...?

          He puts the ice cream in the freezer...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (self-conscious)
                        Yeah... it's a shame when you
                        gotta look forward to the groceries
                        being delivered for a little
                          company.  

                                        RAUL
                                  (oblivious)
                        If I could just get you to sign...

          Johnny signs an electronic pad like all the delivery guys
          use nowadays...

                                        RAUL
                        And if I could ask you to sign
                        once more... 

          He pulls a tabloid out of the bag...  JOHNNY CUT AND PASTED
            APPEARING TO TOUCH ELVIS WITH THE HEADLINE, "JOHNNY SEES
          ELVIS' SECRET PAST"...

                                        RAUL
                        For my personal John Smith
                          collection.  It's flying off the
                        racks down at the store.  

          As Johnny signs his autograph...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't let me catch you selling
                        these on EBay.

                                        RAUL
                        Thanks, Mr. S.    

          As Johnny opens the door to let him out, the alarm
            sounds...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oops, it resets automatically...

  5CONTINUED: (3)5

          Johnny punches the code in again to turn it off... Raul's
          exit is a little chaotic and he's actually already gone
          by the time Johnny says --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good to see you... Raul.

          And Johnny's alone again... he turns to his groceries,
          sighs just a tad...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Dinner for one... defrost a little
                        veal to go with my capers... for
                        a nice piccata... catch up on the
                        third season of X Files...

          And as he picks up the jar of capers... RAMP TO HIS FACE... 
          HEAR THE WHISTLE OF A TEA KETTLE...


  66INT. JEFFREY'S HOUSE - DAY

            A hulking yet frail old man who walks with a cane (not
          unlike Johnny's) is in his kitchen pouring himself some
          tea... this is JEFFREY GRISSOM, 79, who has a grim, almost 
            Scandinavian face.  Finding Johnny standing there holding
          the jar of capers in his hand...

                                        JEFFREY
                                (talking to himself)
                        Now I'll have my tea.  In a moment,
                        I'll think, 'I'm the man who's
                          drinking the tea; I'm the man
                        making this tea, that's here in
                        the cup, disappear."

          The old man speaks the words seriously and slowly, a kind
          of 'to do is to be' mantra... and as he leaves the kitchen,
          Johnny following, he does a curious thing... he moves to
          a mirror in the hall... Johnny and we are not at an angle
          to see his reflection so we cannot be sure what he sees...
          but his eyes are sad as he reaches out to touch the mirror
          and he says...

                                        JEFFREY
                        Where have I gone?

            Whereupon the vision ends and we return to --


  77INT. JOHNNY'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          as he reacts curiously and puts down the jar of capers...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Poor guy... I ought to give him a
                        call... maybe he likes the X
                          Files...

          He starts putting the rest of his groceries away... on a
          whim, glances into a small kitchen mirror to see his own
          reflection which is perfectly normal. 

          That's when it begins...

          Johnny looks down at...


88HIS HAND -- HIS THUMB IS MISSING

          That's right... it's missing... gone... 


          JOHNNY

            reacts... pushing in to his face as it fills with shock
          as he looks back to...


          HIS HAND BUT THIS TIME TWO FINGERS ARE MISSING


          JOHNNY

            reacts...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, vision, not real... can't
                        be real... fingers can't be
                          disappearing...

          He holds up both hands...and fingers (different ones on
          each hand) are simply not there... in a panic, he moves
          to the phone and picks it up, dials 9-1-1 with the last
          finger he has left... but the phone falls to the floor as
          he looks to see his entire hand is gone (all the
            disappearances take place off camera)... and as we cut to
          a new...


          ANGLE - JOHNNY HAS NO ARMS

          and this is a terrifying nightmare... the phone is
            squawking on the floor...

          Johnny crawls onto the floor like a worm... talks into

  1010INT. DR. GIBSON'S OFFICE - DAY

          The next day.  Johnny is being examined by DR. GIBSON
          with the penlight in the eyes...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why does every doctor insist on
                        shining a light in my eyes?  I
                        don't see these things with my
                        eyes...

          She finishes... 

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Your eyes don't know that.  I can
                        always detect pupillary fluctuation
                        after you've had a vision...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, I'm not even sure this was
                          a vision... it was more of... of
                        an hallucination...

          She examines brain wave readouts... and he's quite serious
          as he says --

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        I'm scared I'm really losing it
                        this time, doc.  I mean what if
                        my synaptic paths are
                          deteriorating?

          She looks at him with compassion.

                                        DR. GIBSON

                        Yes... and I think we should be
                        looking at the very real
                          possibility of a tumor in the

                        How's your sex life...

          Johnny reacts for a beat, gives her a raised eyebrow...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that a medical question or do
                        you have tickets to the symphony?

                          triggered some anxiety and this
                        is how it expressed itself.
                                (off Johnny's reaction)
                        It's not healthy to be isolated,
                        Johnny.  Get out of the house,
                        have some fun, be with people. 
                        It's hard to disappear when you're

  1111EXT. JEFFREY'S HOUSE - DAY

          The number says 1-3-3-0... Johnny moves to the front door
          and rings the bell... it's a nondescript, tiny house
          surrounded by woods.  The kind of little house you'd drive
          by a thousand times and never notice.  It is freshly
          painted and well kept up.


          THE FRONT DOOR

          opens to reveal Jeffrey Grissom, dressed in a sweater,
          using his cane... looking sternly, even suspiciously out...

                                        JEFFREY
                        Yes?

          Looking at Johnny with his cane, they seem almost like a
          mirror image... and perhaps we might wonder if Johnny
          isn't looking at a version of his own future self.  Jeffrey
          is gruff throughout.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Grissom, my name's John Smith.

                        Oh, we share a grocery boy.  He
                          accidentally delivered my capers
                        to you last week.

                        I know.  Raul brought them back. 
                        He told me you don't get a lot of

                        I can play down to your level if
                        I have to.  Come in.

          Johnny enters... Jeffrey looks around - an old habit - to
          see if anyone is watching outside...

                        I'm sorry.

                                        JEFFREY
                        Don't go getting morose on me.
                                (re: the cane)
                        You're young to need one of those.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Car accident, a few years ago.

                                        JEFFREY
                        Remarkable how fragile the human
                          skeleton is.  How easily joints
                          rupture, bones crack.  Can I get
                        you something?  I opened a bottle
                        of a dry Rioja...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe just a diet coke...

          Jeffrey stares at him...

                                        JOHNNY
                        The Rioja sounds fine.

          Jeffrey goes to a wall bar, slides a door open to reveal
          glasses and bottles of wine... to pour...

                                        JEFFREY
                        Bodegas Palacios Remondo, 2000...
                        it was a fine year for Rioja...  
                        I only drink a glass or two...
                        and the bottle is never the same
                        the next day... one of the
                          disadvantages of living alone... 
                        do I open the bottle or do I not
                        open the bottle... knowing that
                        much of it will be wasted...

          He hands it to Johnny and as he does... RAMP TO JOHNNY'S
          FACE... as we HEAR the old man YELL from a VISION...


  1313INT. JEFFREY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Johnny is standing there alone... reacts to the continued 
          MOANS OF PANIC...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 1 - 12/9/02 GRN    13.


    13CONTINUED:13

          Johnny follows the sound... into the kitchen where he
          finds Jeffrey on the floor... did he fall?  But no... on
          closer inspection, we see the horror in Jeffrey's face
          and notice that one of his arms and one of his legs are
          missing...  ON JOHNNY as he reacts...  then RESUME JEFFREY
          to find that the rising flood of invisibility has left
          him only a head without a mouth... only his fear stricken
          eyes remain...

          It all happens far more quickly than it happened to Johnny
          in his kitchen... but it is the same nightmare... the
          VISION ENDS...


  1414RESUME JOHNNY AND JEFFREY

          as before... Jeffrey has noticed Johnny's vision...

                                        JEFFREY
                        Is anything wrong?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  Since the accident... I just
                        'go away' for a few moments now
                        and then...

                                        JEFFREY
                        I know exactly what you mean.

          Johnny wonders about the mystery of this man and these
          visions as his eyes catch on an old, old photograph of a
          charming 1920s farmhouse with a little boy standing with
          his parents in front of it... There is a very distinctive,
          leaded glass window in a prominent place on the front of
          the house...

                                        JEFFREY
                        The house I grew up in.

          Johnny puts down his cane and picks up the photo, studies
          it... 

                                        JEFFREY
                          I haven't been there since I was
                        six years old.  When I retired
                        here in Maine, I wanted to find
                        that house, if it still exists. 
                        But now my health's failing and...
                                  (dismissive)
                          ...sentimental whim of an old
                        man.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I could look into it.

            Jeffrey's eyes light up.

                                        JEFFREY
                        Oh, I wouldn't want to--

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's no trouble.  

          The door opens suddenly, startling Jeffrey...

                                        ALMA (O.S.)
                                (her own set of keys
                                in her hand)
                        Hello?

          As Jeffrey turns, he accidentally knocks his wine glass
          over; fortunately it's almost empty and...


          CLOSE - A SINGLE DROP FALLS ON THE HARDWOOD FLOOR 

          Johnny retrieves the glass for him as...


          ANGLE AT THE DOOR

          ALMA (30's, plain), Jeffrey's assisted-care nurse, walks
          in carrying a bag full of nurse's accoutrements.  She has
          the calm passive-aggressive quality that Nurse Ratchet
          had in Cookoo's Nest...

                                        JEFFREY
                        What are you doing here?   

                                        ALMA
                          Jeffrey, you've got company. 

                                        JEFFREY
                        We were just about to play chess.

                                        ALMA
                        Good afternoon, Mr.--

                                        JOHNNY
                        Smith.

                                        ALMA
                        From the television.  I've seen
                        you.  I'm Alma, Jeffrey's home
                        care specialist.

                                        JEFFREY
                          Television?

                        Mr. Smith is famous, Jeffrey.

          Jeffrey looks to Johnny for an explanation.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have sort of a psychic ability...
                        to see things...

            Jeffrey's eyes narrow...

                                        JEFFREY
                          I believe I have heard of you. 
                        The coma victim.  You're the one
                        who touches things. 
                                (beat, thoughtful)
                        Like a jar of capers perhaps?

          Johnny smiles at him, this guy may be old but he's
          remarkably sharp.  Jeffrey's mind works as the scene
            continues...

                                        ALMA
                                (re: photo)
                        What have you got there?

                                        JOHNNY
                        This?  A picture of Mr. Grissom's
                          childhood home.  I thought I'd--

                                        ALMA
                          Jeffrey, are you giving away your
                        things again?

                                        JEFFREY
                                (testy)
                        He said he'd help me find...

          Alma takes the picture and places it back on the mantle...

                                        ALMA
                                (to Johnny)
                        Last week he gave his watch to
                        the refrigerator repairman.

                                        JEFFREY
                                (angry)
                        You've never been able to find
                        the house.  Why not let him try?

          She smiles a patronizing Ratchet smile at him...  He glares
          at her.

                        I'm afraid I'll have to ask you
                        to leave, Mr. Smith.  I think
                          Jeffrey's had enough excitement
                        for one day...

          Johnny feels awkward but he's been invited to leave...

                                        JEFFREY
                                (studies him)
                        Another time perhaps.

          Jeffrey hands him his cane... except it isn't Johnny's
          cane, it's Jeffrey's cane (and in time we may wonder if
          Jeffrey did not hand him the wrong cane deliberately). 
          As Johnny takes the cane... RAMP TO HIS FACE --


  1515EXT. PARISIAN BISTRO - NIGHT

            Johnny/Jeffrey standing in a tiny outdoor French
            nightclub... a female SINGER with an accordion sings the
          same song and we segue to her version without missing a
          beat...  it's early in the morning... only a few patrons
            remain... this is the last song in her set...


          WIDER

          the money shot to see Johnny/Jeffrey at this bistro along
          the Seine... the Eiffel Tower in the background...


          CLOSER

            Johnny/Jeffrey is wearing a trenchcoat, hands in his
          pocket.

          A STREET MAINTENANCE MAN sweeps up outside the restaurant
          gaining Johnny's attention... he makes pointed eye contact
          with Johnny/Jeffrey... something here isn't quite right...

          The girl sings directly to Johnny/Jeffrey, smiles
            seductively...

                                        FRENCH SINGER

          as he returns and his eyes wander naturally to the record
            player... as the song ends...

          Johnny hands him back his cane, retrieves his own.

                        Have a lovely day, Mr. Smith.

          She opens the door for him to leave and he exchanges a
          last look with Jeffrey who studies him evenly but seems
          under the thumb of this nurse somehow.  But for now there's
          nothing to do but to exit... and as he does...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                        Well, it looked a bit like this
                        one... At least, it had that same
                        kind of window...

          Moving back to see Johnny and Bruce standing with a
          CURATOR, (female, 35) over a desktop filled with books
          and photographs of old houses and barns...

                                        CURATOR
                        Then it was probably a Winchell.

                          Hieronymous Winchell, 1865 to
                        1932.  He was famous for his leaded
                        glass windows... 
                                  (wistfully)
                        A lost art, really...  His company
                        built homes in Northern Maine in
                        the early 1900s.

                        Can you narrow that down a little?

                        Give me a minute.  I'll give you
                        the names of a couple communities
                        where the houses were most common.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          The curator moves away.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Bruce)
                        Maybe he'll recognize the name of
                        one of the towns...

                                        BRUCE
                        You really think he'll be up to a
                        field trip if he does?

                        He wants to see the house he grew
                        up in before he dies... it's
                          important to him... the old guy
                          actually believes he's
                          disappearing, Bruce...

                        That's why you think you got these
                        strange visions...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's the only explanation I can
                        think of... the isolation -- it
                        must really take a toll on a lot
                        of elderly people...

                                (pointed)
                        Yeah.  And a lot of not-so-elderly
                        people.

          The curator returns with some printed material...

                        Here we go.  It's not such a long

                        Thank-you.  This is really helpful.


  1717EXT. JEFFREY'S HOUSE - DAY

          Bruce and Johnny approach the front door, Johnny with a
          file in hand.  Johnny rings the bell.  After a beat, a
          young woman (JUNE STADE, late 20's, plain) opens the door. 
          She's cordial.

                                        MRS. STADE
                        Yes?

          Johnny reacts to the new face...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, hi, I was looking for Mr.
                          Grissom.

                                        MRS. STADE
                        Who?

          Johnny does a take...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jeffrey Grissom.

                                        MRS. STADE
                        Are you sure you have the right
                          address?

          Johnny can't believe this... glances at Bruce...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Of, of course, I have the right
                        address... Jeffrey... 70s, tall,
                        uses a cane, doesn't eat meat...

                                        MRS. STADE
                                (overlapping, growing
                                  concern)
                        I don't know what to say... there's
                        no one named Jeffrey here...

          Johnny gathers himself, incredulous... he looks at the
          house, the street, checks the number... a long beat while
          this happens...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was just here yesterday with
                        Jeffrey Grissom...

                                        MRS. STADE
                        You must be mistaken.  I live
                        here with my husband...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (studies her, evenly)
                        You live here with your husband.

          She looks at Bruce...

                                        MRS. STADE
                        I'm sorry but I don't know any...
                                (Jeffrey Grissom)

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's lying...

          She reacts to the accusation...

                                        MRS. STADE
                        I beg your pardon...?

                                        BRUCE

                        She's lying. 

                                        MRS. STADE
                        I'm going to call the police...

                        him?

          Johnny reaches out to touch her... she recoils in fear...
          slams the door; Johnny just gets his hand out of the way
          in time...

                                        JOHNNY

                        Uh yeah, I'd say that's accurate...

                        Because if I touch her I might
                        see what they...
                                (did to him)

                        John, a lot of these houses look
                          alike...

                        This is the right house.

          Johnny starts touching the house... a curtain at the window
          moves... a five year old face peeks out and disappears...

                                        LITTLE BOY'S VOICE
                        Mommy, mommy, the man is touching
                        our house...

          Bruce is getting nervous...

                        John, I think we better go...

                        Let them call the police.  Better:
                        I'll call the police.

                        Hey, John, maybe this guy used to
                        live in that house or is going to
                        live there in the future...

                        the real world... and a vision...?   

          He looks at Walt and Bruce -- a long beat as they eye him -

  1919INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce stand by the checkout counters talking

                        Keep what quiet?  

          Grimacing, the manager conspiratorially pulls Walt, Johnny
          and Bruce to the side.

                                        MANAGER
                                  (whispering)

                        Look, how was I supposed to know
                        he was an illegal?  He had a
                          driver's license.  Apparently it
                        was a fake driver's license, but...

                        John, maybe we should stop by and
                        see Doc Gibson... maybe she can...

                          disappeared.   The nurse... the
                        nurse is involved somehow...

                                        BRUCE
                        I know all the nurses in home
                        care in this county, what's her
                        name?

                        in home care for the elderly.   
                        She's a good lady.

                        She's involved.

                        Okay, where do we find Alma?  


  2020INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

          Bruce, Walt and Johnny walk down the corridor... ahead, 
            a nurse's station...

                                        BRUCE
                        There she is...

          Johnny looks.  There's Alma all right, standing with her
          back to them, chatting with two other NURSES.  He moves
          with a purpose to her... Johnny grabs her...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What did you do with...

          But as he spins her around, her eyes wide with shock, we

          see that, although from the back she looked EXACTLY like
          the Alma in Jeffrey's house, now that we see her face, we
          see it's a DIFFERENT woman entirely...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not her.

                        What... Bruce...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is not Alma.

                                        BRUCE
                        This is Alma.

                        This is not the right Alma.

                                (to Alma)
                        Are there any other home care
                        people named Alma working in this
                        county?

                        I don't know any.

                        Alma, have you seen my friend
                        John before...

                                        ALMA#2
                        Sure.  Around the hospital, once
                        or twice.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah.  Because he has a problem
                        in his head.

                                        BRUCE
                        You weren't at a client's yesterday
                        with him...

          She shakes her head, puzzled beyond words... moves quickly
          away...

                                        WALT
                        Sorry we bothered you, ma'am.

          Johnny looks as befuddled as we've ever seen him...

                        Just... just do me one last favor.


  2121EXT. JEFFREY'S HOUSE - DAY

          The door opens to reveal a man in his early thirties...
          this is BILL STADE... he reacts as he sees Johnny and
          Bruce standing behind Walt...

                                        WALT
                        Mr. Stade?

                                        MR. STADE
                        Yes?

                                        WALT
                        I'm Sheriff Bannerman.  Could we
                        come in for a moment?

                                        MR. STADE
                        Why?

                                        WALT
                        Mr. Smith insists he was here
                          yesterday...

                                        MR. STADE
                        He was here this morning... and
                        he tried to grab my wife.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't try to grab her.  I tried
                        to touch her.  There's a big
                          difference.

                                        WALT
                        He won't grab anyone...
                                (to Johnny, pointed)
                        Will you?

                        Fine.  Only non-animated objects.

                        This'll just take a few minutes.

          Stade reluctantly allows them to enter... clearly backing
          away from Johnny with suspicion...          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 2 - 12/9/02 GRN    28.


  2222INT. JEFFREY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          It's completely redecorated... nothing is the same as it
          was yesterday... The husband moves away to join his wife
          who is holding her child...

                                        WALT
                        You mind if I look around?

                        This... this is ridiculous.

          Stade nods, go ahead.  Walt moves out of sight toward the
          bedrooms as Johnny hangs back with Bruce... sotto --

                                        JOHNNY
                          Everything's different... they
                          replaced everything... obviously
                        to make it more difficult for me
                        to get visions... 

          Bruce looks at him, worried about his friend... Johnny
          touches things as he goes... but is getting nothing...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        The picture of the Winchell house --
                        it was on the mantle... the bar
                        was over here... glasses in here,
                        he poured a Rioja, 2000... he
                        said it was a good vintage...
                        and...

          As the memory hits Johnny... he looks to the hardwood
          floor and we do an incredible FX ZOOM to the spot where
          the wine glass fell... and find just the slightest trace
          of crusty, dried wine residue where the drop fell...

          Johnny kneels down and slowly reaches out his finger to
          touch the barely perceptible purple dot... and as he does -
          RAMP TO HIS FACE... as an incredible vision occurs all
          around him...

          Incredibly fast motion.  Jeffrey Grissom is on a gurney
          being wheeled out... he's alive and awake but grim...
          Alma leads the way... followed by a crew that removes all
          the old furniture, does light construction work on the
          wall unit... then brings in new furnishings... followed
          by the arrival of the Stades including the kid... and
          this all takes maybe fifteen seconds...          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 2 - 12/9/02 GRN    29.

                        him, that's enough for me.  I

                        earthly clue this guy ever

                                ('to swallow', beat)
                        I just want you to be okay.

                        I'm okay.  I just hope Jeffrey's
                        okay.

          A beat.  A thoughtful Johnny hums The Very Thought of
          You...

                        You know that song?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's called The Very Thought of
                        You.  Jeffrey liked it.  He saw a
                        singer in Paris singing it once. 
                        It stayed with him for some reason.
                                (beat, singing)
                        'It's just the thought of you...'

          Sure, Bruce remembers it...

                        Sarah's right.  Why don't you
                        check into a hotel.  Or maybe
                        even the hospital for a once-over.

                        I don't need a once over, Walt. 
                        I'm not seeing things.  I mean I
                        am seeing things.  But they're

          riding the transmitter's signal, eventually coming to a
          "General Sign and Lighting" van a block away... we go
          inside to see the two black bad guys from Johnny's house. 
          With their ski caps off, we can see one of them is Alma

  4949EXT. SMALL SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

          As seen in Johnny's vision.  The jeep pulls into the
            driveway.  Johnny gets out, his anticipation is hard to
          contain, he moves to the door... and that's when he hears
          it... the music from inside... "Winter Snow"... he*
            smiles... rings the bell... after a beat, the door opens
          to reveal Jeffrey in his same favorite sweater... he barely
          cracks an expression...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (smiles)
                          Jeffrey, you are a sight for sore
                        eyes.

                                        JEFFREY
                        It took you long enough.  Not
                        much of a psychic, huh.

          And as he leads Johnny inside...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  5050INT. JEFFREY'S HOUSE#2 - DAY

          As they enter... the house is not so different than the
          last one as though they wanted to create a familiar
          environment to keep him comfortable.  The song continues
          to play on the stereo... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who are you... why would somebody
                        want to make you... disappear?

                        Oh, I disappeared a long time

                        Are you being kept against your
                        will here?  That nurse of yours...

                                        JEFFREY
                        ...is not a nurse.

                        She had Raul deported...

                                (frowns)
                          I didn't know that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She broke into my house.  Put a
                          transmitter in my car...

                                        JEFFREY
                        They were afraid you might be
                        working for the other side.  I
                        knew better.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't even know there were
                          sides...

                                        JEFFREY
                        There are always sides.  The sides
                        change but there are always sides.

          As an offer of explanation, he reaches out his hand for
          Johnny to take... and Johnny does as they touch... RAMP

  5151INT. PARIS TRAIN STATION, 1960'S - DAY

          An immigration clerk (30's, male) stands across a counter
          from Johnny/Jeffrey.

                                        CLERK
                        Passeport, s'il vous plait.

            Johnny/Jeffrey hands the clerk his passport. 

          CLOSE ON the passport.  It is a United States passport,
          has Jeffrey Grissom's picture on it and his name underneath
          the picture.  Suddenly, we go into --


          A MONTAGE

            Johnny/Jeffrey handing Immigration Clerks his passport,
          keeping CLOSE ON the two sets of hands and the passport
          itself.  The clerk's hands should change, as do the visible
          sleeves of his uniform and the counter top. 
            Johnny/Jeffrey's hands remain the same, although his suit
          changes.

                                        CLERK#2'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Pass, pazhalsta.

          The passport still has Jeffrey Grissom's picture on it,
          but now it is a Soviet Union passport and the name is a
          Russian name, Denis Petrovich Alekseyev, written in the
          Cyrillic alphabet.

                                        CLERK#3'S VOICE (O.S.)
                          Reisepasse, bitte.

          Now it switches to an East German passport -- the picture
          is the same, but now the name reads: Ernst Allmenroder.

                                        CLERK#4'S VOICE (O.S.)
                          Paszport, Prosze.

          Same picture, Polish name: Andrzej Lukawski.

                                        CLERK#5'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Pas, prosim.

          Same picture, Czech name: Milan Havel.

          The vision ends...

                                        JEFFREY
                        I am not in a position to confirm
                        or deny that.

          Johnny studies him a beat, adding it all up in his mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you do with, with a...

                        Or more to the point, what do you
                        do with all of his knowledge,
                          accumulated across five decades
                        and six continents?

                        You make him disappear.   

          Johnny tries to comprehend it all... the record ends and
          catches in a groove... Jeffrey moves to rescue it...

                                        JEFFREY
                        I play the record far too much,
                        I'm afraid.  They wanted to get
                        me a CD but I'll die before I
                        have a CD player.  Recordings
                        haven't been the same since the
                        demise of vinyl.  I have good
                        ears.  I'm famous for my ears.

                        Who was she?  The singer in Paris.

          Jeffrey smiles... 

                                        JEFFREY
                        You're good.

                        Did you know that the government
                        uses psychics?  They may have
                        more interest in you than you

          against the stereo.  He picks it up and we turn 180 degrees
          into a vision... starting this time on the...


  5353THE MONEY SHOT - WIDE - EXT. PARIS - NIGHT

            Johnny/Jeffrey at this bistro along the Seine... the Eiffel
          Tower in the background...


          CLOSER - JOHNNY/JEFFREY

          in his trenchcoat, standing in the tiny outdoor French
            nightclub... the female SINGER with an accordion sings
          the same song and we segue to her version as before...
          it's early in the morning... only a few patrons remain...
          this is the last song in her set...

                                        FRENCH SINGER
                        It's just the thought of you...

          But this time we have a new angle and we include the
          elderly version of Jeffrey who stands a few feet behind
            Johnny/Jeffrey on the cobblestone street talking to Johnny,
          and remembering as he so often remembers...

                                        JEFFREY
                        She was the last woman I ever
                        loved as Jeffrey Grissom... the
                        kind of woman that stays with you
                        a long time... her eyes haunt me
                        in the middle of the night... and
                        her song plays over and over...

          THE STREET MAINTENANCE MAN sweeps up outside the restaurant
          gaining Johnny/Jeffrey's attention... Johnny/Jeffrey and
          Jeffrey turn in unison to make eye contact... something
          here isn't quite right...

          The girl sings directly to Johnny/Jeffrey, smiles
            seductively...

                                        FRENCH SINGER
                        Make all the memories disappear...*

          She finishes the song, the set, looks to Johnny/Jeffrey,
          blows him a kiss... as she disappears inside the
            restaurant... the last customers scatter... a beat later,
          the maintenance man moves quickly inside behind her into
          the darkness of the pub...

                                        JEFFREY
                        She betrayed us.  People had died.

          From their vantage point, the darkness of the bistro is
          interrupted by silent flashes of an muzzle (we don't see
          the gun itself, just the flashes)... several times... 
          after a beat, Johnny/Jeffrey walks quietly away down the
          cobblestone street... but old Jeffrey stands there,
          staring, as he has done all his life...

  5454RESUME

          Johnny studies him.  Jeffrey's mind lingers in the past
          for his first line:

                                        JEFFREY
                        That's when I became the man nobody
                        ever knew, a man of a thousand
                          identities... who can no longer
                        hang on to even one.

                        Esse est percipi...*

                          perceived.' 
                                (he moves to study*
                                the photograph)*
                        Sometimes, I look in the mirror*
                        and I wonder if Jeffrey Grissom
                        still exists at all... or is he
                        gone like the house I grew up
                        in...

                                        JOHNNY*
                        I can't tell you if the house
                        still exists or not... but I know
                        where to look for it...

            Jeffrey's eyes brighten at that... until from off-screen --

                                        ALMA (O.S.)
                        I'm afraid we won't have time for
                        that now.

          They look to see Alma and the Stades.

                        protecting me...

                        We've always protected you,
                          Jeffrey.

                                        JEFFREY
                        You have protected the secrets. 
                        While I've been a prisoner...

                                        ALMA
                        We have to get ready to move again,
                        Jeffrey...

                                        JEFFREY
                        No.  
                                  (controlled)
                        He says he can help me find my
                        house.

                                        MRS. STADE
                        Mr. Smith will be coming with us.

          It's said evenly.  And yet Jeffrey instantly knows that
          Johnny's life is in jeopardy...

                                        JEFFREY
                        That is an overreaction.  He knows
                          nothing.

          Johnny's just beginning to catch on...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I don't know what you're
                          thinking but I...

                                        MR. STADE
                        We're just going to follow you
                        home, Mr. Smith, debrief you, ask
                        you to take an oath of silence.

                                        JEFFREY
                                (looks to Johnny)
                        They're lying.

                                        ALMA
                          Jeffrey, don't be silly, it's not
                        like the old days.

                                        JEFFREY
                        Let me talk to the Secretary;
                        he'll listen to me.  He has no
                        idea how valuable Smith could be.

                                        ALMA
                        We've already talked to the
                        Secretary.  Say good-bye, Jeffrey.

                                        JEFFREY
                                (to Johnny)
                        Listen very carefully.  You are a
                        threat to national security.  By
                        now, I'm sure all of your friends
                        think you have been acting
                          erratically.

          Johnny looks at him incredulously... these things don't
            happen... do they?  He looks to Alma, the Stades all of
          whom have even expressions...

                                        MR. STADE
                        Mr. Smith, no harm will come to
                        you.  We really have to insist.

                                        JEFFREY
                        They will either find you in a
                        car accident in the woods... or
                        not find you at all.  You will
                        disappear.

          And the very first vision that Johnny had comes back to
          fill his mind...  Alma gives the Stades a signal to take
          Johnny by force if necessary... but the doorbell rings...

          Reactions.  Who could this be...

          Mrs. Stade glances out a window... eyes widen as she turns
          back...

                        There are reporters on the front
                        lawn.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was about to mention that I
                        invited a few media people over...
                        just wanted to make sure someone
                        else saw Jeffrey this time...
                                (beat, to Jeffrey)
                        I think you and I were about to
                        go look for a house?

          Off Jeffrey's grin...


  5555EXT. HOUSE - DAY

          A media frenzy greets Johnny outside... and more media
          cars and vans are arriving...  Dana is there...  She makes
          eye contact with Johnny as he escorts Jeffrey to the jeep,
          Jeffrey leaning heavily on his cane is slow and frail but
            determined... the reporters yell questions on top of
            questions -- Johnny, what's this all about, do you really
          know where Jimmy Hoffa is?, what about Amelia Earhardt,
          who is this guy, Johnny?   Sir, what's your connection to
          Johnny Smith...

          Over the din...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you all for coming... could
                        you give us some room please...
                        we just need to get to the car...
                        no, I can't answer any questions
                        yet...

          Dana elbows her way to Johnny...

                                        DANA
                        What the hell is going on, John? 
                        Amelia Earhart?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Dana, I'll explain later... 

                                        DANA
                        Who is this man? 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat)
                        Just an old friend of the family. 
                        Please, just help me get out of
                        here...

    55CONTINUED:55

          Dana sees the urgency in Johnny's eyes as he helps Jeffrey
          into the Jeep... but his path is blocked by the press...

                                        DANA
                                (loudly, to other
                                  reporters)
                        The press conference's been moved,
                        folks.  Follow this Jeep!

          The reporters scramble back to their cars...  Johnny's
          eyes express his thanks to Dana...  Dana smiles a "you
          owe me one" to Johnny...

                                        JEFFREY
                        If it would help, I can tell you...
                                (off Johnny's
                                  expression)
                        ...what happened to Amelia Earhart.

          Off Johnny's reaction as he starts the car...


  5656INT. HOUSE - ALMA AND THE STADES LOOKING OUT THE FRONT

                        We can't just let them leave...

                        What are we supposed to do? 

          Alma mulls over the options and finds very few...

  5757EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - A CARAVAN OF CARS - DAY

          With the jeep in the lead...


  5858INT. JEEP - DAY

          as Jeffrey looks out at the passing countryside with an
            appreciation that you or I might never know...

                                        JEFFREY
                        Slow down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is something wrong?

                                        JEFFREY
                        Do you know how long it's been
                        since I took a ride through the
                          country?  I don't want it to be a
                        blur.

          Johnny smiles...


  5959INT. SEDAN - ALMA

          et al doesn't smile... not at all... as she talks on her
          cell phone...

                                        ALMA
                          Yessir... I understand.  I will
                        take care of it personally.

          She puts the phone away, stares murderously ahead as Mr.
          Stade drives.


  6060EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

          The jeep leads the caravan into a left turn following a
          sign that says "Litchfield, 5mi"...


  6161INT. JEEP - CONTINUOUS

                        Sound familiar?

          Jeffrey doesn't answer right away and as he struggles to

                        It's so different now...  I mean,
                        the roads were gravel back then,
                          everything's new--

          Except, perhaps, the following which suddenly catches
            Jeffrey's eye:


  61A61AHIS POV - A LANDMARK

          an old church, unchanged over the years, the one
          anachronism in a neighborhood full of new houses...


  61B61BINT. JEEP - CLOSE ON JEFFREY

          Push slowly into his face... finally... softly...

                                        JEFFREY
                        If there are railroad tracks --
                        in about a mile... there will be
                          a turnoff to the left... take it.


  6262EXT. ROAD - DAY

          The jeep continues on... the caravan follows...


  6363INT. JEEP - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

          they go over the railroad tracks... an old dirt road to
          the left...

                                        JEFFREY
                        There.  Turn there.

          Johnny turns...


  6464EXT. DEAD END IN SOME WOODS - DAY

          As the jeep and cars behind it arrive and are forced to
          stop...


  6565INT. JEEP

          Jeffrey looks confused...

                        There's another road.  There's
                          supposed to be another road.

          He climbs out of the Jeep...          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 4 - 12/9/02 GRN    49.*


  6666EXT. JEEP - CONTINUOUS

          There is no sign of a road... Jeffrey shakes his head...
          something's not right about this...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry, Jeffrey.

          In the distance, a train horn sounds... his ears perk
          up...

                                        JEFFREY
                        I've heard that before.  I've
                        heard that sound before.  I'm
                        famous for my ears.

          Jeffrey moves into the brush and pushes foliage aside...
          to reveal an old dirt drive...

                                        JEFFREY
                        You see, John, it does exist.  We
                        just couldn't perceive it.

          Johnny turns to the reporters who are getting out of their
          cars, wondering what the hell is going on...  Dana is
          right at the front...  Johnny takes her by the arm...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Please, just hold them off a little
                        while longer...

                                        DANA
                        Hold them off?  How am I supposed
                        to do that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell them... tell them I need to
                        get something out of the woods... 
                          Something amazing...

                                        DANA
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll let you know when I find it.

          Johnny follows Jeffrey into the woods, down the old dirt
          drive...  Dana turns and flags down the other reporters...

                                        DANA
                        Folks, if you'll set up your
                        cameras here... Johnny will be
                        making a statement shortly...          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 4 - 12/9/02 GRN   49A.


  6767NEW ANGLE

          as Johnny and Jeffrey come around a rise on the wooded,
            overgrown road... they see it... that leaded glass window
          on that old farmhouse, falling apart, in front of them...

          Jeffrey looks at it, smiles...

                                        JEFFREY
                        Wait here for me, John.

          Johnny acknowledges as Jeffrey squeezes his shoulder in
            appreciation, eyes never leaving the house, and as they
          touch, push to Johnny as he sees --


  6868P.O.V. - JEFFREY'S MOTHER

          standing on the front porch in 1928 - in period clothes...
          and we'll say, more for production than any other reason,
          that it's still dilapidated, but on the long lens that
          focuses only on the woman, softening all around her, it's
          kind of hard to tell anyway... his father reads the paper
          at a table.

          They are lower class but possess an honest, rural dignity.

                                        JEFFREY'S MOTHER
                        There you are, Jeffrey.


          REVERSE ANGLE - JOHNNY WITH SIX YEAR OLD JEFFREY GRISSOM

          as seen in the photo.  The boy moves to his family...

          studies him as --


          NEW ANGLE - JEFFREY

          moves out of view into the old house... a beat later,
          Johnny turns to see Alma and the Stades moving behind
          him...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Guess you guys just didn't try
                        very hard to find his old house...
                        it really wasn't that hard...

                                        ALMA
                                (evenly)
                        Jeffrey Grissom was our top
                          operative during the Cold War,
                        Mr. Smith... until today, twenty
                        two countries had incontrovertible
                        proof that he died sixteen years
                        ago in Berlin.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sixteen years is a long time to
                        be in prison, any kind of prison,
                        Alma. 

                                        ALMA
                        The name is Rosemary.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Were you really going to kill me,
                          Rosemary?

          She gives him a look: are you serious?

                                        ALMA/ROSEMARY
                                (utterly sincere)
                        Jeffrey has always had a flair
                        for the dramatic.

          They look at each other without blinking for a long long
          beat.  Finally, Johnny looks back toward the house. 
          Jeffrey has not returned.  A beat.          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 4 - 12/9/02 GRN    51.


  7070INT. THE OLD HOUSE - DAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          As Johnny enters... Alma and the Stades with him...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Jeffrey, we should be going...

          There's no response...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Jeffrey?

          All they see is --


            REACTIONS

          Alma's eyes panic, her look sends the Stades into action... 
          they quickly move all over the house and return, shaking
          their heads... but in fact, he has...

            Disappeared.

          And all that's left is...


          JOHNNY'S POV - JEFFREY'S CANE LEANING AGAINST A WALL


            ALMA/ROSEMARY

          glares at Johnny, barely able to talk.  Tight and
          controlled (Note: This is a quote from the end of "Three
          Days of the Condor") --

                                        ALMA/ROSEMARY
                        You dumb son of a bitch.  You've
                        done more damage than you know.

          She rushes out with the Stades.


          ANGLE - JOHNNY AND THE CANE

          He moves to it and picks it up... and as he does... PUSH
          TO JOHNNY as he sees --


  7171CLOSE UP CLERK'S HANDS

                                        CLERK#6 (O.S.)
                        Passeport, s'il vous plait.

          The clerk accepts the passport which is loudly STAMPED to
          pass through.  As the stamp hits the passport....



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 4 - 12/9/02 GRN    52.

          ANGLE TO SEE THE STAMP LIFTING OUT OF FRAME  

          to reveal Jeffrey's current photo with a new name, Pablo
          Arevalo.  In the photo, Jeffrey is grinning.


  7272RESUME JOHNNY

          as he holds the cane and smiles... deciding to take it as
          a souvenir, he walks casually out of the house... as the
          soundtrack reprises "Winter Snow"...*
