OVER BLACK:
MUSIC - string violins treat us to a familiar song opening
and then a voice - male.
TRAVERS (V.O.)
(SINGING)
Winds in the East
Mist coming in--
FADE IN:
A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning,
spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst
white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella)
dances amongst the nimbus.
TRAVERS (V.O.)
--Like something is brewing,
about to begin--
The shadow's direction becomes purposeful - taking us down
through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small
town in the distance.
TRAVERS (V.O.)
--Can't put me finger on what lies
IN STORE--
Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large,
bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.
There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts
the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large
park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from
flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.
She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face
to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her
concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we
will also know as GINTY.)
TRAVERS (V.O.)
--But I feel what's to happen, all
HAPPENED BEFORE--
Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of
a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind
becomes real.
A large hand taps Ginty on the shoulder, she looks up and
smiles. TRAVERS GOFF (35) is handsome and rugged, a wild
poetic look, like Ted Hughes or Dylan Thomas.
TRAVERS
Excuse me ma'am, have you seen my
daughter? I was quite sure I had
left her around here somewhere!
Ginty giggles.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm-
- goodness! I've quite forgotten!
Could it be Prunella?
GINTY
No!
TRAVERS
Pamela?
GINTY
No.
TRAVERS
You're right still doesn't sound
quite-- I'm sure I have a special
name for her--
GINTY
Ginty!
TRAVERS
Why, thank you ma'am! Ginty it is
of course!
(BEAT)
Now, have you seen her?
GINTY
It's me!
Travers puts his nose right up to hers, peering into her
face.
TRAVERS
Gosh! So it is! Well, thank
goodness for that! I was positive I
was going to be beheaded for losing
Her Highness The Royal Princess
Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!
GINTY
You can't lose me!
TRAVERS
Never. I promise. I will never lose
you!
He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through
the park, neighing like a horse.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Hurry now! We mustn't be late! The
adventure is about to begin!
BIDDY (3) and MARGARET - the girls mother, delicate, weak -
stand outside of their lavish red-bricked home. Suitcases
bulge at their feet. Margaret breathes a sigh of relief as
she sees Travers hurrying towards them, he swings Ginty from
his shoulders and plops her on the ground.
MARGARET
The carriage?
TRAVERS
Who needs a carriage my love? A
stroll is a gift!
(beat, excited)
Everybody ready?
GINTY & BIDDY
Yes. Yep!
Margaret takes her youngest child MOYA (1) from the nanny.
TRAVERS
Come along my team! We mustn't miss
the train.
MARGARET
(to her staff)
Thank you so much. For everything.
GINTY
(TO NANNY)
See you soon Katie Nanna!
She picks up her own case; Katie Nanna turns away,
heartbroken.
TRAVERS
Walking bus!
The family get into line, one behind the other, Travers in
the lead.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Don't forget Andrew!
Ginty takes Andrew's leash, her own case and somehow helps
her sister too.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Ready? And off we go!
Passersby tut and shake their heads at the noisy display as
Travers and the girls march down the street.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Left, right, left, right! Coming
through!
Margaret stays for a beat, longingly taking in and storing a
picture of the home she leaves behind.
The procession continues into the bustling downtown.
It's hectic as tickets are purchased and a CLERK marks a
chalkboard with destinations and mileage. Ginty stops, looks
at the list. The last city is--
GINTY
ALLORA--
The Great Western Queensland train chugs its way Westward
from the verdant green of Maryborough toward the brown cake
of Allora.
As it disappears. Ginty stands on the last train platform,
watching her home, her past, fade into the distance.
Ginty's face speaks resignation as it, and the train, recede
as billowing white smoke and dust fill the frame.
--and into the sunlight.
RALPH
Sun came out to say hello just to
you.
PAMELA
Don't be preposterous.
Pamela sniffs the air.
PAMELA (CONT'D)
It smells. Like--
RALPH
Jasmine.
PAMELA
--chlorine and sweat.
Ralph chuckles.
PAMELA (CONT'D)
It's dreadful.
The shiny black, tinted windowed limo cruises up La Cienega
Blvd, passing all kinds of monstrous architecture and garish
billboard advertising.
With its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel
resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun.
The limo glides into the forecourt.
--Arid heat, dazzling sunlight. Travers, Margaret and the
children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway. From
their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling
red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new
home. The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the lush
greens of Maryborough. The house is ramshackle and meagre.
A swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few
skinny chickens strut about the porch.
TRAVERS
A palace! Complete with mighty
steed.
GINTY
And chickens.
MARGARET
OH--
Travers puts an arm around her shoulder.
TRAVERS
We'll build beautiful memories here
my angel.
Margaret offers him a trusting smile.
MARGARET
Yes.
Travers takes Ginty and Biddy's hands and they run towards
their new home. The chickens scatter.
TRAVERS
(in the distance)
--in this house you get to share a
bedroom!
Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there's simply
nothing but barren land and red dust for miles.
UNDERWATER
SPLOSH! A green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then
another SPLOSH!
We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony
throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer-free
swimming pool.
A tray of untouched dinner sits outside the door.
Pamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately,
not a hair out of place. The limo pulls up to the curb and
Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car
and rush round to open the passenger door.
RALPH
Good morning Mrs!
PAMELA
It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, why do I
bother? We're just not going to get
it right are we?
RALPH
Hm?
PAMELA
Will it be the same driver every
day?
RALPH
(oblivious to her tone)
Yes ma'am! I'm all yours.
(BEAT)
Sun came out again!
PAMELA
You say it like you're surprised.
Like the sun is particular about
whom it appears for. It seems you
think that I am responsible for
it's miraculous dawning every day.
For goodness sake, it's California!
RALPH
It certainly is!
He gestures for her to get in.
RALPH (CONT'D)
(trying a British accent)
Madame.
Pamela grimaces.
THREE MEN in suits wave at the limo as it drives through the
enormous gates of Disney's Burbank Studio and pulls up in a
very twee forecourt.
They are: DON DAGRADI (45) and the SHERMAN BROTHERS, ROBERT
(34), he leans on an old worn cane and RICHARD (31), who has
a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face.
Don opens the car door for Pamela and puts out a hand to help
her from the vehicle but she pushes it away.
DON
Pamela! Good morning!
PAMELA
It is so discomfiting to hear a
perfect stranger use my first name.
Mrs Travers. Please.
The Sherman's look at each other. Uh oh.
DON
I do apologize, Mrs Travers.
(BEAT)
I am Don DaGradi, the script
writer.
PAMELA
Co-script-writer. I shall certainly
be having my say Mr. DiGraydi.
DON
Gradi. Wonderful! I welcome it.
PAMELA
If indeed we ever sign off on a
script.
Bob and Dick flash each other a look. What the fu ?
DON
Uh. Okay, so this is the rest of
your team, Dick and Bob Sherman!
Music and lyrics.
(TO SHERMANS)
Boys, this is the one and only Mrs
P.L. Travers, creator of our
beloved Mary.
PAMELA
Poppins.
DON
Who else?
PAMELA
Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary.
(to Dick and Bob)
A pleasure to meet you, though I
fear we shan't be acquainted for
too long.
BOB
Excuse me?
PAMELA
These books simply do not lend
themselves to chirping and
prancing. No. Certainly not a
musical. Now, where is Mister
Disney? I'd very much like to get
this started and finished as
briskly as is humanly possible.
BOB
Don?
DICK PAMELA
Not a music--? If you'll point me in his
direction?
DON
Uh-- erm. Ha! We had planned a
little tour of the studio for you
MRS TRAVERS--
PAMELA
No thank you.
DON
--Wanted to show the place off.
PAMELA
No one likes a show off.
Pamela takes herself off in the direction of a building.
DON
Mrs Trav-- it's a long way to--
Don hurries behind her, Bob looks like he is about to murder
the woman and Dick is finding the whole thing incredibly
amusing.
The Shermans, Don and Pamela are riding through the studios
on a golf buggy.
PAMELA
I am perfectly capable of walking.
A couple of Disney characters (Donald and Goofy) bounce up to
the golf cart, waving brightly. Goofy opens his arms to
Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror.
PAMELA (CONT'D)
Shoo! Go away!
The characters stop bouncing and Di Gradi gives them a nod
meaning `beat it'.
PAMELA (CONT'D)
Ghastly.
Bob and Dick Sherman are in shock.
Don leads Pamela into the plushly appointed outer office,
where DOLLY - a young, perky secretary - smiles brightly at
her.
DON
(TO DOLLY)
Could you let--
PAMELA
(over, to Dolly)
Would you let Mister Disney know I
have arrived please?
Dolly loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly and
picks up the phone.
DOLLY
(whispering into phone)
She's here!
DON
A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I
may.
PAMELA
You may. Whether I heed it or not
will be another matter entirely.
DON
Wow. Uhm. It's just that he can't
stand being called Mr Disney. We
are all on a first name basis here.
(TO DOLLY)
Dolly! Is he--?
We hear a man's cough before a beaming Walt Disney, in the
flesh, appears at the end of the corridor, his arms
outstretched.
WALT
Well, there ya are at last!
Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way
serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to
greet her.
WALT (CONT'D)
Oh my dear gal!
Pamela is open mouthed.
WALT (CONT'D)
You can't imagine how excited I am
to finally meet you!
Pamela doesn't know what to do with this amount of
enthusiasm. She extends a formal hand before he manages to
get her in an embrace.
PAMELA
Oh!
He squeezes her tight and then lets go. Pamela struggles to
compose herself, she hasn't been that close to a man in
decades!
PAMELA (CONT'D)
Hum-- ah. It's an honour, Mister
Disney.
Disney winces.
WALT
Walt, you gotta call me Walt, ya
know. `Mister Disney' was my old
man.
There's a hint of something mournful in the way he says `old
man.'
WALT (CONT'D)
Come here! Come here!
He links his arm through hers, much to her chagrin, and leads
her into his interior office past an imposing floor to
ceiling cabinet bursting with Academy Awards.
Travers sits, looking out at the dimming sky, playing a
mournful air on his tin whistle, Ginty curled up in his lap,
Andrew the dog asleep beside him. Margaret steps out onto the
veranda an almost imperceptible glance at the half-empty
bottle at his feet.
MARGARET
It's rather late--
Travers continues to play.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
Biddy and Moya are already asleep.
Travers takes the pipe from his lips and sighs.
TRAVERS
Ginty.
He kisses her cheek and gently lifts her from his lap.
GINTY
Good night father.
(BEAT)
`night mother.
MARGARET
Good night dear.
Margaret strokes her hand over Ginty's hair as the little
girl slips into the house but hovers unseen by the door,
watching her parents. Travers pats his knee and Margaret
perches on it.
TRAVERS
I'll make us a good life.
(BEAT)
I promise.
(BEAT)
I'll make you proud again.
Margaret strokes Travers face and turns her face to the sky.
MARGARET
Look at the stars.
Pamela's door opens a crack and another half-eaten room
service meal appears as she kicks it into the hallway. She
shuts the door quickly behind her.
CLOSE ON:
A tiny park, about half a metre square - it has grass, tiny
trees made from flowers, a small hole filled with water for a
pond, park benches made with twigs and miniature wooden
clothes-peg people. Ginty puts the finishing touches to the
bandstand and sits back, staring in wonder.
The moment is broken with the sound of hooves as her father
appears, atop his horse.
TRAVERS
Ahhh, there's my girl.
The horse moves up to her.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
That's it Albert. Give Ginty a
smooch. There's a good boy, give
her a little smooch.
The velvety muzzle of the horse "smooches" Ginty's neck and
ear as Travers climbs down from the nag.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Poor old Albert; he's your secret
uncle you know? But a miserable,
horrid witch turned him into a nag.
GINTY
Why did she do that?!
TRAVERS
Because she hated the sound of his
laugh.
GINTY
Poor Uncle Albert! How can we fix
him?
TRAVERS
We have to teach the witch how to
be happy again.
GINTY
How?
TRAVERS
I'm not quite sure darling.
(BEAT)
Your mother's been calling you for
a good hour. I shouldn't go if I
were you, she's after little slaves
for housework!
(RECITING YEATS)
Ah, I must scrub and bake and sweep
Till stars are beginning to blink
AND PEEP;
And the young lie long and dream in
THEIR BED
Of the matching of ribbons for
bosom and head.
Travers sighs, let's the words ring in his ears, touches the
end of daughter's nose.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Do you want to know what it feels
like to fly Ginty?
She nods. He hauls himself onto Albert, leans down and swings
Ginty up so she is facing him.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
You trust me?
She nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over
his shoulder.
He grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her
arms.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Gee up, Albert. Yah!
Travers kicks the horse into a trot, then into a canter, he
points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Yah!
Ginty squeals with delight.
The limo floats along the windy canyon roads, cresting the
top of the hill and revealing an awe inspiring vista.
RALPH
Beautiful ain't it?
PAMELA
(refusing him the
SATISFACTION)
If you like that sort of thing.
RALPH
I do.
Travers and Ginty gallop at great speed. The horse kicking up
great clods of earth as they hurtle away into the distance.
Ginty - in a rather tattered school uniform - is diminutive
in front of the huge double doors to the bank. An upright,
top hatted gentleman holds the door of the bank open
chivalrously for her.
Ginty and Travers sit by the river. Ginty eats an enormous
ice cream and Travers sips continuously from his hip flask.
TRAVERS
We share a Celtic soul, you and I.
This world is just an illusion,
Ginty old girl. As long as we hold
that thought dear, they can't break
us. Money, money, money. Don't you
buy into it Ginty! It'll bite you
on the bot!
How did we end up here eh? Look at
it. Barren. Breathless.
Get as far away from this place as
possible my love. Find yourself a
patch of green.
(HE SIGHS)
It's a chimera you know? The world,
the bank, you and I, Mr Randolph-
whackety-whack-Belhatchett. All an
illusion.
He stares across the river, experiencing a wave of deep
melancholy. Ginty looks up at him, aware of his profound
unhappiness, but unable to understand its source.
Another untouched meal in the hallway.
Pamela steps from the car and Walt is there to greet her.
WALT
May I walk with you?
PAMELA
I'm sure your country doesn't have
any laws about sharing a pavement.
As they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the
rehearsal room window and down onto the lot.
Pamela makes her way to the bench she waits on for Ralph.
She sits down, wraps her arms around herself, closes her
eyes.
PAMELA
(TO HERSELF)
It goes up.
Margaret sweats as she hangs out laundry whilst desperately
shushing her screaming infant.
MARGARET
There there. Shush shush now--
Ginty and Biddy run in and out of the sheets, chasing a large
hen that squawks and flaps its wings trying to escape the
girls.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
(to the girls)
If you could just--
TRAVERS
(CALLING)
Ahoy Goffs!
The girls and Margaret look up, surprised to see Travers so
early.
GINTY
Father!
She runs at him and swings her high into the air with one
arm, catching Biddy with the other.
MARGARET
What a lovely surprise! Did you
finish early?
TRAVERS
I couldn't stop thinking about my
beautiful girls on this beautiful
day in this beautiful place and I
thought to hell with it!
(to Ginty and Biddy)
And what do we say about beauty
ladies?
GINTY/BIDDY/TRAVERS
A thing of beauty is a joy forever!
MARGARET
BUT--
TRAVERS
Buts are for goats my love!
He dips her and smooches her.
GINTY & BIDDY
Urgh!
TRAVERS
(whispering to Margaret)
I'll put in extra hours tomorrow.
(TO GINTY)
What are we playing?
GINTY
The hen got out and we've been
trying to catch her!
Travers spies the clucking demon.
TRAVERS
That's no hen! That's Aunt Ellie,
your mother's horrendiferous
sister!
GINTY
(LAUGHING)
That's a made up word!
BIDDY
Really?!
GINTY
Not the aunt!
(BEAT)
Quick! Catch her before she flies
away on the--
TRAVERS/GINTY
East Wind!
Travers throws his jacket to the ground and begins to chase
the hen, tearing through the clean sheets and treading them
into the ground.
MARGARET
Oh!
TRAVERS
I'll wash them again my love!
Margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs.
The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the
poor little hen runs for its life. Even the dog joins in,
Margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a
whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket, she slips it
back inside - out of sight, out of mind.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Go Sergeant Ginty! Fell the beast!
Ginty dives on the hapless bird, who pecks her soundly and
scarpers. It's chaos. Travers, the girls, the dog and the
evasive hen running into each other, falling over each other,
cursing and laughing.
GINTY
Aunt Ellie!
TRAVERS
Oh she's a foul fowl!
Disney sits on Pamela's bench, deep in contemplation.
Piano music tinkles from somewhere in the building and then a
VOICE--
DICK
All around the cathedral
the saints and apostles
look down as she sells her wares
Walt is dragged from his thoughts and gets up to follow the
sound.
DICK (CONT'D)
Although you can't see it
you know they are smiling
Each time someone shows that he
CARES--
Pamela sits by the pool, arms clasped around her, looking at
the stars. The pink and green of the hotel shimmers in the
water making it look like a chalk painting.
TRAVERS (V.O.)
The world is an illusion Ginty.
Ginty sits on the front step of the porch, arms clasped
around her body, face to the sky.
The sounds of the evening closes in - crickets, the last
deafening chorus of the birds.
Travers walks up the path to their home, trailing his suit
jacket over his shoulder, his shirt and tie loosened. His
shirtsleeves are marked with sweat. His face is a study of
something close to despair.
He looks up to see Pamela sitting on the front step and
immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of
greeting.
TRAVERS
Ahh the Countess Mary Sparklestick!
Pray tell me, what are you
concentrating so hard on?
GINTY
I am laying eggs!
TRAVERS
Really!? Fabulous!
GINTY
Today I am a hen.
TRAVERS
Indeed! I can see the feathers
sprouting as we speak!
Margaret steps out onto the veranda, takes one look at her
husband and knows he is drunk.
MARGARET
Helen Goff, would you lay the table
for supper please?
GINTY
I'm not Helen!
TRAVERS
(OVER)
She can't possibly lay a table;
she's busy laying eggs!
MARGARET
I need-- (help.)
TRAVERS
She's laying!
MARGARET
(her face contorts in
PAIN)
I'm sorry!
She goes back indoors and slams the door behind her. Ginty
gets up to go indoors and Travers catches her by the arm.
He swallows hard, eyes welling.
TRAVERS
(urgent, his voice
BREAKING)
Don't you ever stop dreaming Ginty
my love. You can be anyone you want
to be. Anyone.
GINTY
I want to be like you.
TRAVERS
Don't.
(HE CHOKES)
Don't leave yourself always
searching for-- something--
He coughs to stop a crying jag and leaves her alone on the
porch.
Ginty is unnerved by her Travers' demeanor, she creeps around
to the side of the house where she watches her father appears
in the window of the washroom. She doesn't know what to do as
he leans his head against the wall and breaks down sobbing.
OMITTED
DICK (V.O.)
Safe and sound--
A small stage and dais stand central of the event over which
a large sign reads:
SPONSORED BY THE BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA
DICK (V.O.)
Soon that tuppence safely invested
in the bank will compound--
The Allora townsfolk are out in force. Ginty walks with her
family. Her father attempting to memorise speech notes as
they pass through the crowds.
DICK (V.O.)
And you'll achieve that sense of
CONQUEST--
Margaret nudges him as Randolph Belhatchett and his family
walk past.
TRAVERS
(clears his throat)
Mr Belhatchett.
Randolph looks at Travers, then at Travers shaking hands, his
family nod and move on. Margaret looks upset by this.
DICK (V.O.)
As your affluence expands--
Travers buys two immense sticks of fairy floss and hands them
to Ginty and Biddy.
MARGARET
Travers, Biddy's stomach--
TRAVERS
Oh, for Gods' sake, Meg, stop
whinnying like an old nag will you?
Margaret is aghast at being spoken to like that in public but
she keep her mouth shut.
Ginty notices Travers eyes stray towards the refreshments
tent.
GINTY
(PANICKED)
Father-- will you ride the carousel
with me!?
But the refreshment tent has Travers in its grip.
TRAVERS
Meet you there in a blink of an
eye!
Ginty stands with her family at the carousel, eyeing the
refreshment tent.
MARGARET
(TO GINTY)
I'll take Biddy to get ready for
her dance.
(BEAT)
Where's your father?
Margaret sees the direction of Ginty's gaze. Her face falls
but she takes Biddy by the hand and heads for the stage.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
Come on Biddy.
Travers steps heavily, one at a time, up the steps onto the
dais, and finds his way to the speaker's podium. Margaret
and Ginty watch, hearts in mouths, Biddy blissfully unaware.
TRAVERS
Good afternoon, distinguished
guests, our biggest supporter Mr
Randolph Belhatchett and his lovely
wife, ladies and gentlemen, boys
and girls!
Randolph looks at Travers with displeasure and then at one of
the bank staff.
RANDOLPH
Why is he speaking for the bank?
BANK WORKER
He's the manager.
TRAVERS
I'm honoured to be here on behalf
of the Belhatchett Bank of
Australia. Shortly, it will be my
very pleasant duty to present the
awards to our young performers. But
before I begin, I'd like to say a
very few words to our very youngest
citizens about the role of the -
er, the Bank in our community.
Ginty allows herself to breathe. So far, so good.
MARGARET
He's using too many `verys'. He
always says `very' too much when
HE'S--
She can't say it. Ginty takes her mother's hand but Margaret
pushes the hand away.
Travers is now in lip synch with Dick Sherman.
TRAVERS DICK (V.O.)
And you'll achieve that sense And you'll achieve that sense
of stature of stature
As your influence expands as your influence expands
To the high financial strata To the high financial strata
That established credit now That established credit now
COMMANDS-- COMMANDS--
As before.
TRAVERS
Bankruptcies! Debtor sales!
Opportunities!
All manner of private enterprise!
Shipyards! The Mercantile!
Collieries! Tanneries!
Incorporations! Amalgamations!
Banks!
There's a smattering of applause, Travers is encouraged,
Margaret and Ginty look relieved, even hopeful.
But then Travers momentarily looks lost, a slight breeze tugs
the speech notes from his hand and they float down in front
of the dais.
TRAVERS
Uhmm. Thank you kindly. Thanking
you. Now-- what, what am I doing
next? Oh! It's a marvellous idea to
encourage children to open
accounts. My daughter, the Princess
Ginty-- she's-- uh.
(looks at Ginty)
How old are you? Come up here.
Ginty - what? Me?
Ginty glances to her mother and then, on trembling legs,
makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais.
Margaret watches, growing uneasy.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Ginty has a bank account-- and
that's good. Give her a drink!
The audience is shocked.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
(MUMBLING)
I mean give her a hand.
Everyone is beginning to look uncomfortable.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
I shall return in just a moment to
present the awards. But right now I
must-- relieve myself.
Gasps from the audience.
Margaret - dying.
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Give us your shoulder, Ginty, will
you? I'm busting. There's a good
girl.
Father and daughter walk towards the edge of the stage,
Travers leaning on Ginty's shoulder. The shameful glare of
Allora burning into them.
DON (O.S.)
When fall the banks of England,
England falls!
Travers somehow loses his footing before reaching the steps
and topples off the stage. There's an audible, horrible snap
as he lands in an undignified pile. But, despite his ugly
injury, Travers cannot stop laughing.
Pamela rushes past Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck, through the
lot, past Ralph - who's taking his lunch at the cafeteria -
and towards a patch of green, a communal lawn at the back of
a soundstage.
Ginty fights the smell of the warm rubbish in the midday sun
as she ransacks the outdoor trash cans, finally finding what
it is she's looking for.
Pamela flops down onto the ground, digging her fingers into
the dirt and lawn.
Pamela picks a daisy, finds a stray twig and arranges them in
the grass.
RALPH
Mrs?
Pamela looks up, her eyes are red rimmed but she's not
crying.
RALPH (CONT'D)
I, uh, brought you a tea.
He hands her the tea in a takeaway cup.
PAMELA
It's blasphemy to drink tea from a
paper cup.
Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot. He's not quite
sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea.
Pamela puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits
and pieces of twig and bloom that she's plucking from the
area around her.
RALPH
Everything okay Ma'am? Would you
like me to drive you home?
PAMELA
All the way to England? Yes,
please.
Ralph lowers himself onto his haunches.
RALPH
You got family back there Mrs?
PAMELA
You're an impertinent man you know?
You ask an awful lot of questions
that have no relevance to you being
able to carry out your duties.
RALPH
(LAUGHING)
I know! I do, do that. Yes!
PAMELA
And you have no barometer.
Ralph is confused.
PAMELA (CONT'D)
Let us say that I haven't family
who'd notice whether I was halfway
across the world or sitting in my
living room.
She pulls a thread from the hem of her skirt, ties two twigs
together.
RALPH
MA'AM; I--
Ralph sees that she has a little collection of things, he
looks around for some more. Pamela takes a stick and digs a
small line through the grass then hands it to him.
PAMELA
Make a little furrow, there.
Ralph dutifully does as he's told, looking over his shoulder
for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil.
Ralph pokes the ground, thinking.
RALPH
I gotta kid.
PAMELA
Well, most people do.
RALPH
Jane-- she's got all kinds of
troubles.
Pamela raises an eyebrow.
RALPH (CONT'D)
Handicapped you know? Myelitis--
transverse.
(BEAT)
She's in a wheelchair see? That's
why I concern myself with the
weather-- sunny day she can sit out
in the garden. Rainy day I have to
leave her cooped up inside.
(BEAT)
Worry `bout the future, but then I
stop cuz you can't do that. Only
today.
Pamela takes the plastic lid off the paper cup and pokes
holes in it.
PAMELA
Now look.
She takes the lid, twigs now sticking out of the poked holes
and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of
Pamela's tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig
struts forming a roof.
PAMELA (CONT'D)
It's a band stand.
She takes the cup of tea and gently pours the steaming liquid
into Ralph's trench, which runs all the way around the park.
RALPH
A river!
PAMELA
(CORRECTING HIM)
Lake.
RALPH
Lake.
(BEAT)
Hey! I wish I could take her there!
He points at the miniature park.
PAMELA
Wouldn't that be nice?
Ginty runs out onto the porch where she sees her mother in
her white nightdress striding purposefully through the garden
like some ethereal ghost.
GINTY
Mother!
She runs out into the yard but stops as she hears Biddy.
BIDDY (O.S.)
Ginty!
Ginty turns back to the house and then back towards her
mother but Margaret has disappeared into the darkness.
GINTY
(CALLING)
Mother! Mother!
The baby is screaming now.
The mud-stained hem of Margaret's nightdress sweeps along the
ground, as her feet move towards, and then into, the water of
the creek. One step, two, three, the water coming up over her
ankles, soaking the nightgown.
GINTY (V.O.)
But the stars were guarding them,
they glittered as they spoke "We
shall send a guide to show them the
way to the magical ladder which
will bring them all the way up to
SEE US"
Biddy and Moya are calming as Ginty places the girls in front
of the fireplace.
GINTY
And who do you think those
sparkling messengers sent? Who was
it that came flying through the
starry, starry sky to carry us up
to see them?
Ginty wraps Moya in a blanket and puts her in Biddy's arms.
BIDDY
An elf?
Ginty begins to untie Albert from the fence still speaking to
the girls through the window.
GINTY
Their old Uncle Albert of course!
(beat, to Biddy)
Stay right here, be good--
Ginty climbs atop the horse.
BIDDY
Are you going to the sky?
GINTY
I'm going to find the end of the
story so I can bring it back for
you!
BIDDY
Is it happy?
Ginty rides fast, desperately searching the darkness for her
mother and turning back frequently to check that the lamp
still burns on the porch.
Margaret is up to her neck in the freezing water of the
creek. Shivering cold. She wills herself forward into the
water. She wants to sink down and simply float away.
From behind her comes the clip clopping of hooves. Margaret
turns her head and there, atop the horse, is Ginty.
Margaret begins to weep.
Ginty jumps down from the horse and rushes to her mother,
wading into the water to grab hold of her.
Ginty bobs up and down in front of her mother in the deep
water.
MARGARET
Sometimes a person we love, through
no fault of his own, can't see past
the end of his nose.
GINTY
It's time to go home, ma.
She reaches out her hand--

Ralph drives Pamela up to the entrance to the park. Two
security guards stop the car briefly and then the gates pull
open to reveal Walt Disney waiting for Pamela.
Ralph jump out of the car to let his passenger out but Disney
is there first.
WALT
Welcome to the Magic Kingdom!
Pamela steps out of the car and her eyes nearly pop out of
her head with brightness of the place, unbelievable colour
and excitement.
PAMELA
Is it all like this?
Pamela pops a headache pill.
WALT
Yup! Isn't it wonderful?
Ralph hovers at the car, filling his eyeballs with as much
Walt Disney as he can get before he has to drive away.
PAMELA
Do you always get everything you
want Walter?
WALT
Pretty much!
PAMELA
With the exception to the rights to
my books of course!
WALT
War ain't over yet Pam!
Walt takes Pamela by the arm and leads her through the gates
and a murmur goes through the crowds as they gawp. A YOUNG
WOMAN breaks free and rushes up to Walt.
YOUNG WOMAN
I love you so much! Can I--?
She proffers a pen and paper but Walt is prepared, he takes a
signed postcard with his face on it from his top pocket and
hands it to the woman.
PAMELA
(DISGUSTED)
Pre-signed?
WALT
(TO WOMAN)
You should get hers too.
(gesturing to Pamela)
This woman's a bona fide genius!
The woman looks expectantly at Pamela who just snorts. she
realizes she's getting nothing and, clutching her precious
postcard to her chest, melts back into the crowd who part
like the red sea for Walt and his guest.
Walt and Pamela make their way down Main Street. Walt stops
anyone from getting too close by immediately handing out
postcards to anyone who gets near.
WALT
In Adventureland there is a tree--
this is a fun fact. A titbit.
PAMELA
Tidbit.
WALT
(OVER)
It has three million leaves, four
million flowers.
PAMELA
Gosh.
WALT
And they said only God could make a
tree!
Pamela rolls her eyes.
There is a protracted silence as they walk, both encompassed
by their own thoughts. The sunshine, the joyful crowds just
background colour.
They pass by a store front and Walt glances up at the window.
It reads: Elias Disney Contractor Est. 1895. Pamela notices
the look but doesn't say anything.
WALT (CONT'D)
Where did she come from?
PAMELA
Who?
WALT
I think you know who.
PAMELA
She flew in through the window one
day.
WALT
Through the window huh?
Pamela nods curtly.
WALT (CONT'D)
It's just that easy isn't it Mrs
Travers?
He sees right through her.
WALT (CONT'D)
I know you don't wanna be here so
I'm gonna take you to one ride-- my
favourite amusement and then I'll
set you free.
Way ahead of them the carousel spins in the distance.
The carousel slows to a halt and a herd of excited children
climb down from the horses and disappear into the park.
WALT
Mrs Travers, I would be honoured if
you would ride Jingles. She's Mrs
Disney's favourite horse.
He escorts Pamela to a beautiful white horse, roses on it's
bridal.
PAMELA
No thank you. I'm happy to watch.
WALT
No greater joy than that seen
through the eyes of a child.
Pamela looks at the children climbing onto the carousel.
WALT (CONT'D)
There's a child in us all.
PAMELA
Maybe in you Mister Disney, but
certainly not I.
WALT
Get on the horse Pamela!
Pamela sighs and allows Walt to help her onto the horse.
WALT (CONT'D)
When we first met, you said to me
`they're family.'
PAMELA
I said what?
WALT
Mary Poppins, the Banks's, they're
family.
(BEAT)
The boys have had an idea for your
Mister Banks. I think it'll make
you happy.
PAMELA
You brought me all the way out here
to tell me that?
WALT
No. I brought you all the way out
here for monetary gain. Had a wager
with the boys that I couldn't get
you on a ride. I win!
He clambers onto his own horse, gestures to the ride
controller and off they go!
Pamela gently bobs up and down, Walt waves to her and she
sees the unbridled thrill from the child in Mister Disney
spilling out. The tiniest, tiniest of smiles threatens to
surface on her lips as he points a finger in the air as if
shooting for the stars.
WALT (CONT'D)
Yah!
Ginty skips off the porch, clutching her tuppence. Chattering
to herself about pears.
The limo crests the top of the hill.
Pamela flees to her bench, wrapping her arms around herself.
Disney comes after her.
WALT
Please Mrs Travers-- You must
listen.
PAMELA
You shouldn't make promises you
can't keep, especially to children,
they hold on to them you see? And
those promises they just sit there
inside of them, like little doses
of poison, all those broken
promises, eating away forever.
WALT
Pamela? I don't understand why this
is so hard for you. Please, make me
UNDERSTAND--
PAMELA
The books weren't written for the
children. They were written for the
promise breakers.
WALT
The promise breakers? Mrs Travers I-
-
But she's gone, face to the sky, eyes closed, breathing.
WALT (CONT'D)
Mrs Travers?
Ralph pulls up and gets out of the car.
RALPH
Woah! Mister Disney!
WALT
Hi.
RALPH
Hi! I'm such a huge fan. It's such
an honour to--
He suddenly sees that Pamela is more deeply entrenched in
herself than usual and his priority becomes her.
RALPH (CONT'D)
(TO WALT)
Excuse me.
Ralph moves past Walt and gently taps Pamela on the shoulder,
she opens her eyes, relieved to see him.
RALPH (CONT'D)
You ready to go Mrs?
PAMELA
Yes. Thank you.
WALT
PAMELA--
PAMELA
(TEARING UP)
I'm so sorry Mister Disney. To have
put everyone to so much trouble.
WALT
You must reconsider. You must.
PAMELA
I simply can't give her up. Not
yet. Perhaps not ever. I don't know
WHY
DISNEY
You do know why!
PAMELA
I can't, he's--
DISNEY
He's?
PAMELA
I just-- Goodbye Mr Disney.
She goes to get in the car and Disney puts a hand to stop her
but Ralph blocks it.
RALPH
The lady's ready to go now sir.
Walt steps away and Ralph closes the door to the car.
WALT
He's?
Walt watches the car disappear, wracked with frustration and
confusion. He takes a seat on Pamela's bench and wraps his
arms around himself and looks to the sky.
Ralph climbs out of the limo and opens the back door for
Pamela. He gestures for a valet to come and take her bags and
opens the trunk of the car.
RALPH
It's been a pleasure driving you
Mrs.
PAMELA
No one likes a fibber.
RALPH
(CHUCKLES)
I really have enjoyed it. Didn't
know who you were at first and then
guess what?
PAMELA
You found out?
RALPH
I was telling my daughter all about
my day and how I was driving this
nice writer lady, Mrs Travers for
Mr Disney and--
PAMELA
AND--
RALPH
AND--
(he leans into the
PASSENGER WINDOW)
And she makes me go to her bedroom
and get this!
(he pulls out a Mary
POPPINS BOOK)
Can't stop reading it. I'm very
slow mind you.
Pamela smiles.
PAMELA
Would you like me to sign it?
RALPH
(DELIGHTED)
Would you?!
PAMELA
I'd be honoured.
Ralph hands her his pen and she begins to write.
PAMELA (CONT'D)
Your daughters name?
RALPH
Jane.
PAMELA
Really?
RALPH
Uh huh. Like the girl in the book.
PAMELA
(reading as she writes)
To Jane and her dearest father--
(she looks at him)
I've just this instant realized I
don't know your name.
RALPH
Ralph.
She shakes his hand.
PAMELA
Pamela.
RALPH
Pamela.
PAMELA
You're the only American I have
ever liked, Ralph.
Ralph is chuffed to bits.
RALPH
May I ask why?
PAMELA
No. Now take this--
She hands him the piece of Beverly Hills Hotel stationery
with her notes on.
RALPH
(READING)
Albert Einstein, Van Gogh,
Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo--
(BEAT)
What is this?
PAMELA
They all had difficulties. Jane can
do anything that anyone else can
do, do you understand?
Ralph looks at her in awe.
PAMELA (CONT'D)
Look at the bottom.
RALPH
Walt Disney!
PAMELA
Deficiencies in concentration and
hyperactive behavior. Explains
everything!
Pamela turns to leave.
RALPH
Thank you Mrs.
Pamela doesn't look back.
Ginty skips up the path, clutching a brown paper bag. She
ruffles Andrew's fur before entering the house.
A black London Taxi pulls up outside the house. Pamela climbs
out of the car, struggling to pull her huge Mickey Mouse out
too.
Disney employees pass by a giant movie poster which reads:
MARY POPPINS - OPENING SOON! Walt exits the building. He's
but a few steps out of the door when Tommie appears behind
him.
TOMMIE
Walt.
She hands him a sheet of paper.
TOMMIE (CONT'D)
Invitation list for the premiere.
WALT
Is that everyone?
TOMMIE
Not everyone.
She looks at Walt questioningly.
WALT
(SIGHS)
We'll premiere in London as well.
It'll be more convenient for her.
Tommie holds his look.
WALT (CONT'D)
There'll be cameras, press,
interviews-- I have to protect the
picture.
TOMMIE
Okay.
Walt walks away, he's lost a bit of steam. Tommy watches him
go.
OMITTED
Pamela looks wonderful in a long white gown with turquoise
silk gloves to her elbows and matching wrap falling from her
shoulders.
PAMELA
(TO DOORMAN)
Would you call me a taxi please?
DOORMAN
Absolutely.
The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo
pulls up to the kerb. Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up
but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person
in America.
RALPH
Had a feeling a certain friend of
mine might be needing me tonight.
PAMELA
Ralph!
She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug.
RALPH
You look like a million bucks!
Let's get you to the ball.
He opens the back door for her and she climbs in.
It's spectacular! Disney's biggest Hollywood opening. Bulbs
flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red
carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters
stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their
hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens
play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream
every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and
posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces
up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing
for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is
completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest
party you could ever go to.
The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out.
He rushes round to Pamela's side and helps her from the car.
Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm
up to shield her eyes. It's too much.
RALPH
(in her ear)
This is your night. None of this
would be possible without you.
She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks
into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic
whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: "Who is
that?" "Is that anyone?" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and
Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.
Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and
Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved
hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy
train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds
of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.
Pamela moves through the spangling, glittering, perfect
toothed Hollywood crowd and no-one pays any attention to her.
The shadow of an umbrella leaves the ten-year-old Ginty
sitting in the lush grass, arms wrapped tightly around her
chest, face to the sky as a smile breaks free across her
face.
TRAVERS (V.O.)
(SINGING)
Winds in the East
Mist coming in--
The shadow of an umbrella, floats higher and higher--
TRAVERS
--Like something is brewing,
about to begin--
And further and further--
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
Can't put me finger on what lies in
STORE--
We give chase but cannot catch up--
TRAVERS (CONT'D)
But I feel what's to happen, all
HAPPENED BEFORE--
And the umbrella floats up, up, up into the atmosphere and
AWAY--
FADE OUT:
