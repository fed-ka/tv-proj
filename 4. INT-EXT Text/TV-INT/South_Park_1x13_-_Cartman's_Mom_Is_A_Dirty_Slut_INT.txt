               The boys are gathered around the counselor's desk. Behind 
               them is a LARGE poster that reads 'FATHER & SON DAY IS 
               COMING'.

                                     KYLE
                         Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong 
                         with Cartman.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh, well there's a news flash.

                                     STAN
                         No, no. We saw him having a tea party 
                         with his stuffed animals.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, he was doing their voices and 
                         pouring tea for them.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh okay... Eric is obviously suffering 
                         from some kind of emotional distress, 
                         okay?

                                     KYLE
                         What do you mean?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Have you boys noticed anything 
                         recently that troubled Eric?

                                     STAN
                         No.

               *Note - the poster should be very visible in this shot.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Well, obviously something is bothering 
                         him, okay?

               Finally the Counselor looks up at the wall.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh, of course!

               The counselor walks over, right in front of the poster, then 
               reaches past it and grabs a video camera.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         My video camera! Boys, if you could 
                         videotape Eric's behavior, then I 
                         can study him psychologically and 
                         find out what's wrong, okay?

                                     STAN
                         Is that legal?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh, hell yes.


               Cartman and his mom are sitting at the dinner table.

               Kitty walks up and meows.

                                     CARTMAN
                         No, Kitty this is MY corned beef 
                         cabbage.

                                     KITTY
                         Meow.

                                     CARTMAN
                         No, kitty!! That's a BAD KITTY!!!

               Kitty hisses.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         How is your beefy roast, snookums?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Mom... Can I ask you a question?

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Sure, hon.

                                     CARTMAN
                         You know how my friend Stan has, 
                         like, a DAD?

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Uh-huh.

                                     CARTMAN
                         And my friend Kyle has a DAD... And 
                         my friend Kenny has a DAD?

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Yes...

               The two just sit there in silence for a LONG TIME.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Well what's your question, hon?

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Pissed)
                         GODDAMMIT!! Do I have a dad?!?!

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Oh...

                                     CARTMAN
                         I wanna know where I came from.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Oh... Hmmm... Well, you see, Eric, 
                         sometimes when a man and a woman are 
                         attracted to each other, they want 
                         to be... CLOSE to each other.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Uh-huh...

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         And, sometimes, the man puts his Hoo-
                         Hoo Dilly in the woman's Cha-Cha.

               Cartman tries to understand.

                                     CARTMAN
                         So, WHO put his Hoo-Hoo Dilly in 
                         your Cha-Cha?

               Cartman's mother thinks.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Eric, the day I met your father, it 
                         was like magic... It was a beautiful 
                         autumn night, when the aspen trees 
                         were turning; At the twelfth annual 
                         drunken barn dance...


               Inside the barn is absolute chaos. People are singing, 
               dancing, fighting... but most of all, drinking.

               Beer flows from huge steins, steel kegs, and glass bottles. 
               Everyone is absolutely bombed.

                                     MS. CARTMAN (V.O.)
                         I was young and naïve then...

               Now we see the younger Ms. Cartman. She looks pretty much 
               the same except that her hair is longer. She is chugging a 
               yard of Beer.

                                     MAN
                         Wow! I've never seen a woman drink 
                         that much!! You're amazing, Ms. 
                         Cartman!!

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                              (totally drunk)
                         Oh, heck, I haven't even started 
                         yet! I baked cookies... would anybody 
                         like one?

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         I wouldn't mind gettin' a hold of 
                         YOUR cookies, Ms. Cartman!

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                              (Sexy)
                         Well... Go right ahead, Officer 
                         Barbrady...

               Barbrady leans into Ms. Cartman... Then grabs a cookie, bites 
               into it and walks away.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Mmm, that's a good cookie7!

               Square Dancing MUSIC kicks in.

                                     JIMBO
                         Come on everybody, let's do the 
                         drunken barn dance!!

               Ms. Cartman stumbles over to the dance floor.

                                     MS. CARTMAN (V.O.)
                         And then I saw him... He was the 
                         most beautiful, charming piece of 
                         ass I'd ever seen in South Park.

               The camera settles on Jimbo for a moment... Was Jimbo 
               Cartman's dad?! No, just then, the crowd parts, and standing 
               there... Is a large, buff Native American Ute man. He and 
               Ms. Cartman stare at each other.

                                     MS. CARTMAN (V.O.)
                         His name was Chief Running Water.

               As the camera ZOOMS IN on their faces, that gay 'Near/Far' 
               song from Titanic plays.

               Ms. Cartman walks over to the Chief and starts to mosh with 
               him, vulgarly.

               Finally, Ms. Cartman trips, falls down, gets back up, vomits, 
               and keeps dancing.


               Cartman is sitting, listening to the story.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         I don't recall exactly how the rest 
                         of the night went, but the next 
                         morning, I was pregnant with you, my 
                         little blueberry muffin.

                                     CARTMAN
                         So where is Chief Running Water -- I 
                         mean, DAD, now?

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Oh, I never saw him after that. I 
                         wasn't really that interested in 
                         him.

               Cartman sits there and thinks for a moment.

                                     CARTMAN
                         That isn't a very romantic story, 
                         mom!

               Ms. Cartman goes back to eating.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         I heard he still lives on the Ute 
                         reservation just outside of town.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Wow... To think all this time I'm 
                         actually a naïve American.

               Kitty walks up and meows.

                                     CARTMAN
                         NO KITTY! That's a BAD KITTY!!!

               A clean shaven Bob Saget takes the stage.

                                     BOB SAGET
                         Hey, I just flew into the studio, 
                         boy are my arms tired.

               The audience doesn't react, but Grandpa laughs.

                         Why didn't the skeleton cross the 
                         road? 'Cause he didn't have the guts.

               The audience again remains silent. Grandpa slaps his knee, 
               laughing. The boys just sit there.

                                     BOB SAGET
                         Knock, Knock.

               The audience is stumped for a moment. Silence...

               Suddenly they ERUPT with laughter. They roll around on the 
               floor, laughing uncontrollably.

               So is grandpa. Stan can't believe it.

                                     STAN
                         This guy sucks!

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, he's almost as bad as that guy 
                         on Full House.

               Suddenly, the doorbell rings. The boys walk over to answer 
               it.

               When Stan opens the door, he finds Cartman dressed in all 
               Indian garb.

                                     STAN
                         Cartman? What the hell are you doing 
                         dressed up like an Indian with a 
                         bear necklace?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Naive American, Stan. And the bear 
                         is very important to my people.

                                     STAN
                         What?

               Kyle and Kenny walk up behind Stan and check Cartman out. 
               Kenny immediately starts laughing uncontrollably.

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY! THE WHITE MAN HAS MOCKED MY 
                         PEOPLE LONG ENOUGH! YOU KEEP YOUR 
                         GODDAMNED MOUTH SHUT!!!
                              (Back to normal)
                         Stan, I need to borrow your bike to 
                         ride over to the reservation.

                                     STAN
                         What are you talking about, Cartman?

                                     CARTMAN
                         My name isn't Eric Cartman. It's 
                         Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow 
                         your bike, or do I have to kick you 
                         in the nuts and steal it?

                                     STAN
                         Go ahead, dude.

               Cartman leaves, closing the door behind him. The boys head 
               back to the couch.

                                     KYLE
                         Man, Cartman's more screwed up than 
                         I thought.

                                     STAN
                              (holding out VHS tape)
                         Yeah, we better get this video tape 
                         over to Mr. Mackey quick.

                         Wow! I wish WE had a stupidest 
                         homevideo!

               Suddenly, the boys all seem to get the same idea. The camera 
               PANS along each kid's face as MUSIC kicks in. They look at 
               their tape with wide eyes.


               The younger Chief Running Water and Ms. Cartman laugh and 
               dance into the hay loft, a few yards away from the party.

               Ms. Cartman giggles as she and the Chief fall into the hay, 
               embracing each other.

               They look into each other's eyes for a beat...

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         We got tired of dancing, so we went 
                         off to find a private spot. I knew 
                         that she wanted me because she kept 
                         saying romantic things.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Oh Chief, I want your hot manchowder.

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         Woa! Hello!

               The two start going at it, as random townspeople dance and 
               vomit past them.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Wait, wait!!

               Ms. Cartman sits up.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Who is THAT?!

               Again the crowd parts, and this time we see a younger CHEF 
               standing in the crowd with a big afro.

               Again, the Near/Far faggot song from Titanic plays as the 
               camera zooms in on Ms. Cartman's and Chef's faces.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Chief... Could you excuse me for a 
                         minute?

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         Huh?

               Ms. Cartman gets up and walks over to Chef.

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         You gotta be kidding me!!

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Why, hello there... I don't think 
                         I've seen you around before.

                                     CHEF
                         Naw, I'm new in town.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Well, what's a nice, handsome,
                              (looking down)
                         BLACK... man like yourself doing in 
                         a pit like South Park?

                                     CHEF
                         I'm gonna open up my own restaurant 
                         here!

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         My, how exciting! Would you... Care 
                         to put your tongue in my mouth?

                                     CHEF
                         Damn, baby, you cut right to the 
                         chase, don't you.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         I'm plastered.

               Ms. Cartman grabs Chef and starts violently French kissing 
               him.


                                     CHEF
                              (Grabbing the afro)
                         Take off that wig!! Now what's gotten 
                         into you?

                                     CARTMAN
                         YOU'RE my dad, Chef! Chief Running 
                         Water said you got together with my 
                         mom at the drunken barn dance.

                                     CHEF
                         What? No...
                              (Thinking to himself)
                         Uh... Did I?

                                     CARTMAN
                         He said you kissed her with your 
                         tongue.

                                     CHEF
                         Oh! Oh, that's different! Women don't 
                         get pregnant from tongue kissing, 
                         children!

               Cartman just stands there, blinking.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Looking sad)
                         So, you're not my dad?

                                     CHEF
                         Of course not. Here,
                              (Helping Cartman onto 
                              a stool)
                         You children sit down and let me 
                         explain something to you about where 
                         babies come from. Then you'll see 
                         why I can't be your dad.

               Music kicks in. Chef gets ready to sing.

                                     CHEF
                              (Singing)
                         When a man loves a woman and a woman 
                         loves a man (Actually, sometimes the 
                         man doesn't love the woman, but he 
                         acts like he does in order to get 
                         some action.) The magic starts to 
                         happen and the two take off their 
                         clothes -- that's right. They caress 
                         and touch each other until a part of 
                         the man grows. Oooh, they roll around 
                         and now things are really starting 
                         to get hot. And the man say, "I love 
                         you" and the woman says, "Hold on a 
                         second, I gotta go to the bathroom." 
                         So you wait and you wait and you 
                         wait and you wait and... You wait 
                         and you wait and you wait. You wait 
                         and you're cooling down and she's 
                         still going to the bathroom. Finally 
                         she comes back and she says, "Baby 
                         I'm getting hot." And that's when 
                         you gotta jump her butt and pump her 
                         full of...

               Cartman is tremendously confused.

                                     CARTMAN
                         WHAT?! So who the hell did that to 
                         my mom at the drunken barn dance?!?!

               Chef thinks.

                                     CHEF
                         Oh, children, that was a long time 
                         ago... But I'll tell you what I 
                         remember...


               Chef and Ms. Cartman are rolling around in the hay, with 
               their tongues in each other's mouths. Ms. Cartman is on her 
               back, Chef is on top of her.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Oh, Chef! You're so strong!!

                                     JIMBO
                         Hey everybody! Look who's here!! The 
                         AFC champion Denver Broncos!!!

               Sure enough the entire Denver Bronco team walks in.

                                     BRONCOS
                              (Ad libbing)
                         Are we too late for the party? Where's 
                         the beer. etc.

               Ms. Cartman, still on top of Chef, turns to look at the Denver 
               Broncos.

               Once again, the gay Near/Far Titanic song starts, this time 
               the camera ZOOMS in on Ms. Cartman's face and then ZOOMS in 
               on the entire 1991 Denver Broncos team.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Oh, Chef! OH, CHEF!!

               Chef looks surprised.

                                     CHEF
                         Damn woman, what's gotten into to 
                         you?

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         WHOOPEE!!!

               Suddenly, a hand emerges from beneath Ms. Cartman. Chef pulls 
               the hay away to reveal... MR. GARRISON!!

                                     CHEF
                         Garrison!! What the hell are you 
                         doing?!

               Garrison looks at his hand.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         You're DRUNK, Mr. HAT!!

               As Ms. Cartman looks at Garrison, that gay Near/Far song 
               from Titanic swells up yet again. ZOOM IN on Ms. Cartman's 
               and Garrison's faces.

                                     CHEF
                         Ah, MAN!! I'm outta here!

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Come on, Chef. Haven't you ever heard 
                         of a manage' au three?

                                     CHEF
                         Yeah, when two women are involved!

               Chef gets up and leaves.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Damn! Damn, Damn! Oh well, guess 
                         It'll just have to be you and me, 
                         Ms. Cartman.

               They roll around in the hay.


                                     CHEF
                         And THAT'S who she was with last... 
                         Mr. Garrison.

                                     CARTMAN
                         No! NOOOO!!!! NO GOD NO!!!!!!

               A clip of what Kyle filmed of Cartman. No voice-over. Just 
               Cartman's insanity.

                         Really? You don't think so?

                         Oh, Stanly, we just heard the news

                         Man, Cartman's going to be famous.


               Garrison is drinking at the local bar with most of the 
               townspeople of South Park.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat...

                                     MR. HAT
                         Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan Mr. 
                         Garrison.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Mr. Hat you need to admit you have a 
                         drinking problem... Another Cosmo 
                         please!

               Just then, Cartman slams the door open. He's standing in the 
               doorway, eyes fixed on Garrison, looking pissed off.

                                     CARTMAN
                         All this time... Why didn't you tell 
                         me, father?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         What the hell are you talking about, 
                         Eric?

                                     CARTMAN
                         It was YOU all along!!

               Garrison doesn't answer... Perhaps he IS Eric's father!

                                     CARTMAN
                         YOU were with my mother the night of 
                         the drunken barn dance!

                                     JIMBO
                         Garrison?! That's impossible! He's 
                         gay!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         I am NOT GAY!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Then you DID sleep with my mom?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         No!

                                     JIMBO
                         He's gay!

               Garrison thinks. He doesn't know what to say.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay, okay! I admit it!! I might 
                         have made love to your mother at the 
                         Drunken Barn Dance!!

               Cartman's face lights up.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         But Who here DIDN'T?!?!

               The room is silent.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Now come on! Honestly, who has NEVER 
                         had sex with Mrs. Cartman?

               Everybody looks to one another. Nobody speaks up... Not even 
               the preacher or Jesus.

                                     MAN
                         I haven't!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         You don't count, halfie! You don't 
                         have any legs!

                                     MAN
                         Oh, yeah.

               Cartman can't believe it.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         So you see, Eric. Anyone here could 
                         be your father. I'm afraid you're 
                         never going to know...

               Cartman puts his head down.

                                     JIMBO
                         Don't feel too bad there, kid. I 
                         never knew who my father was either...
                              (Pause)
                         I mean, I DID know who he was, and, 
                         well, we had great times together 
                         and huntin' and fishin', but -- well, 
                         hell, you know what I mean.

               Cartman slowly walks out of the bar very sad violin music 
               begins to play.

               Everyone looks like they genuinely feel bad for Eric.

                         At my laboratory! We can do DNA 
                         genetic testing! I'll take some of 
                         your blood, along with the blood of 
                         everyone here and we can determine 
                         who your father is!!

               Cartman looks happy! Everybody else looks worried.

                                     CARTMAN

                         Yes! Of course... I mean, that much 
                         testing will cost a pretty penny... 
                         but...

                         How much?

                         Hmmm... I wonder if I can get this 
                         go-cart started?

               ANGLE - CARTMAN'S

               The boys watch on in disbelief.

               ANGLE - VIDEO SCREEN

               We again see the horrific dragging of Kenny. He stops on the 
               train tracks, checks his head, then gets pummeled by the 
               train.

               In the TV studio, the audience is laughing hardily.

                                     STAN

               The audience is still laughing.

                                          ACT IV


               Cartman and his mother are in Mephesto's laboratory, along 
               with most of the men of South Park.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         Alright, from everyone's accounts, I 
                         have narrowed down Eric's possible 
                         father to the people in this room...

               As Mephesto lists off the names, we see their worried 
               expressions.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         Officer Barbrady, Chef, Jimbo, Mr. 
                         Garrison, Ned, Chief Running Water, 
                         Gerald BROVLOFSKI, Myself, my friend 
                         Kevin, or the 1989 Denver Broncos.

               The little monkey guy looks worried.

               The Broncos all look worried, too.

                                     STAN
                         Wow, I always knew Cartman's mom was 
                         a slut, but goddamn!

                                     MEPHESTO
                         The test results are in this 
                         envelope... Shall I open it?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Yes! For God's sake get on with it!!

               Mephesto opens the envelope and reads the paper inside. His 
               expression grows huge.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         The father of Eric Cartman is INDEED 
                         someone in this room!!

               Everybody looks around nervously.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         The father is...

               A drum roll starts. The camera starts to focus on different 
               people in the room.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Who is Eric Cartman's father? Is 
                         it... Chief Running Water?!

               Chief looks around nervously.

                         Or is it... Chef?! Is it Mephesto? 
                         Or that little monkey guy that follows 
                         him around?

               The little monkey guy raises his eyebrows.

                                     NARRATOR

                                     MR. GARRISON
