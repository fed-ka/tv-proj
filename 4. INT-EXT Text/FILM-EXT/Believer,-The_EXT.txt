Danny walking home alone. He sees TWO KIDS (older, tougher,
blonder) coming toward him. He slips off his yarmulke and
slants across the street. The kids slant that way. He hears
a RUMBLING, looks up at an ELEVATED TRAIN entering a station.
He runs up the steps toward the SHRIEKING train....
A tough working-class Queens bar.
Looking out the front of the train as it rushes toward
Manhattan. A dramatic sky rises above the skyline.
The three skins -- O.L., CARLETON, BILLINGS -- walk up an
East Side street. Billings is telling a story....
BILLINGS
...So she takes the pants in back --
where they try them on? And I think
fuck it....
CARLETON
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
BILLINGS
She's been giving me the eye. She's
hot. So I wait till the owner goes up
front....
During this, O.L. starts to SPRAY PAINT a crude SWASTIKA
onto a BUS KIOSK. A VOICE startles them....
VOICE
What are you doing??
They jump, turn. Danny steps out of the shadows.
DANNY
(indicating swastika)
What do you think you're doing?
BILLINGS
Who the fuck are you?
DANNY
(coming toward them)
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks,
you can't even make a decent
swastika.... Give me the paint.
(O.L. looks to his friends)
Give it to me.
Danny's will is stronger; O.L. hands over the spray can.
Danny shakes it, critiques O.L.'s rendering....
DANNY
(gruff but avuncular)
It's too squared off. You got to
orient it up and down, diamond-shaped,
like this....
(sprays an excellent swastika)
...The arms go clockwise.
(hands the can back)
You're going to Curtis Zampf; me, too.
Let's go?
They exchange looks: how did he know about Curtis?
CURTIS ZAMPF (O.S.)
...Where I grew up in South Boston
twenty years ago, when a kid walked
down the street, everyone knew who he
was...
Danny and the other skins walking down the middle of the
street, drinking beer, oblivious to traffic.
BILLINGS
Bring your friends.... We're not his
friends.
DANNY
Then I won't bring you....
The others laugh. Someone HONKS behind them. Billings turns:
BILLINGS
FUCK YOU.
BLACK VOICE (O.S.)
Hey, bonehead...get your moon ass off
the street.
Billings turns and throws his beer at the voice. A CRASH,
BREAKING GLASS, a screech of BRAKES, CAR DOORS open and shut...
BILLINGS
Why don't you go back to Rwanda and
give each other AIDS.
That does it. The skins run out of frame. SOUNDS of a fight.
Danny watches, indifferent, then finally joins in.
A Mercedes pulls up, Carla driving. The skins climb out,
Carleton guiding O.L., who cannot see.
CARLA
He should go to a hospital.
O.L.
I'm okay.
Billings turns back, sees Danny still in the car.
BILLINGS
You coming?
DANNY
(glances at Carla, stays
in the car)
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Billings nods grudgingly. The car drives off. Carleton grins.
CARLETON
Fucking Danny, man...
BILLINGS
He's an asshole.
Once a Jewish neighborhood, now occupied chiefly by blacks,
Latins and more recent immigrants.
As Danny (wearing headphones) comes down the steps... TWO
BLACK KIDS (big, menacing, boombox) are coming up, blocking
his way. Danny walks right between them, forcing them apart.
They turn, glare after him. He turns, glares back. They
scoff and keep going up. He walks on.
He lets himself into a row house. We barely notice the
mezzuzah on the door post.
A HIGH-ANGLE view of the coffee shop. After a moment, Danny
enters frame, starts toward it....
Traveling through low, tree-covered mountains listening to
the overture to Tannhuser.
The van stopped in front. All of them out of the car. No
one's around except the noisy CRICKETS. The city kids are
uneasy.
CARLETON
I thought there were people here....
DANNY
I'll go look....
He walks toward the back. Billings decides to go with him.
O.L.
I better stay with the van....
CARLETON
Yeah, you better stay here and guard it.
O.L. gives him the finger. Carleton laughs -- but he stays
back, too.
Danny and Billings see PEOPLE in back. Now NINE YOUNG MEN
and a bulldog come to greet them: survivalists, speed-freaks,
skinheads...and one blank loner (DRAKE) with a blue swastika
tattooed to his lips like a tiny kiss. A case of STEROID
EXCESS fixes his gaze on Danny.
DANNY
We're from New York. Curtis Zampf
invited us.
WHIT
Who?... Curtis who?
Are they in the wrong place? Then someone laughs, they all
relax, exchange greetings, obscure handshakes. Everyone's
just getting comfortable when, for no apparent reason...
STEROID EXCESS
slugs Danny in the face.
He stumbles backward. The others crowd around, keep him from
falling, also from getting away. Billings starts to help,
but people grab him: this is Danny's problem.
Steroid comes at him.... Danny steps inside the charge and
goes to work on the bigger man's body. We barely see what
happens, but we hear it and feel the crowd's shock. Danny is
stronger than we realized and much more vicious. In seconds,
Steroid sinks to his knees, face bloody. Danny holds up him,
leans close:
DANNY
Enough?
Steroid mumbles in the affirmative. Danny nods -- then hits
him four more shots to the face. Even this crowd winces.
Steroid drops with a wet thud.
As Danny straightens up, wiping the blood off his hands,
people instinctively step back.
DANNY
Which was his room?
KYLE
(ferrety, glasses)
Number ten.
On the end: has an extra window. Danny walks into the room.
Steroid's stuff starts flying out the door.
Danny on a pay phone.
DANNY
Yeah, I'm trying to reach Carla, is
she?... Did she get my other
message?... No, I'll call back....
Danny hangs up the phone, glances into a room where we dimly
glimpse Nazis taking drugs, drinking beer, screaming...
VARIOUS VOICES
Fucking niggers... Fucking niggers?
Fucking gooks!...
Then incomprehensible shrieking rage, a fight, breaking glass...
Danny sighs, bored. He spots two nerdy Nazis, KYLE and WHIT,
playing some battle re-creation board game and rehashing
WWII....
WHIT
...Look, if Hitler had knocked out
the RAF in '39, which he could easily,
easily have done, he'd have taken
England, and the U.S. wouldn't have
had --
KYLE
...A staging ground for the invasion,
yeah. But he blew it going after
civilian targets. Just like he blew
the Russian front, diverting supplies
to Auschwitz....
Danny looks up the hill toward a farmhouse perched above
them. One light burns inside.
DANNY
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
KYLE
Her place is down the road. But she
just comes out for weekends sometimes.
Danny squats to look at the board game.
DANNY
What is this, Stalingrad?
WHIT
Gettysburg. But we're refighting it
with World War I technology. It's a
fucking bloodbath.
He grins maniacally. Danny smiles. Kyle is emboldened by
Danny's unexpected friendliness, lowers his voice....
KYLE
That was unbelievable what you did to
Lucas. The guy's an animal.
DANNY
You could do it.
KYLE
Get out of here....
DANNY
You look right through him. He's
there, but there's something on the
other side of him that you want. It's
all you want. And whatever's in the
way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
As Kyle and Whit contemplate his wisdom...
DANNY
Either of you know anything about
explosives?
They both look up, very interested.
TWO FAMILIES IN TABLEAU -- WOODEN CUTOUTS -- DAY
Jews: MAN (black hat, beard), WOMAN (sheitl, shawl), BOY
(kippah, twerpy), GIRL (fat, ugly), even a DOG, a Star of
David on its side.
Blacks: MAN (watermelon, pitchfork), WOMAN (fat, fried
chicken), BOY (syringe, 9mm), GIRL (twins, welfare check),
DOG (black).
VOICE (O.S.)
Take a breath, let out a little,
relax, then squeeze.
(a RIFLE SHOT;
nothing's hit)
Again...
Another SHOT. A bullet hits the Jewish boy in the rear end.
Sunlight streams through the hole. We are:
Danny peers down the barrel of an M-16. Kyle squats beside him.
KYLE
Which one were you aiming at?
DANNY
The mother.
Kyle nods, patient, is drawing Danny's attention back to the
target when...
DRAKE
Sets up beside them, begins squeezing off rounds so fast, it
sounds like an automatic weapon.
TARGETS: the bullets chew up and knock over all four Jews.
And selectively: shooting the man's face, the woman's
breasts, the boy and girl in the groin. The dog he merely
flattens.
Drake looks at Danny without expression, drops the clip,
shoves in a fresh one and riddles the black family in
similar fashion.
Danny, pay phone to his ear, flipping through a New York
Times. He throws it aside as a voice comes on the line....
DANNY
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny
Balint...? We met at that...[meeting
at your house.]
CARLA'S VOICE
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
DANNY
I didn't realize you cared.
CARLA'S VOICE
I don't. I was just curious how full
of shit you were.
DANNY
Did you know that there was a New
York Times reporter there that night?
CARLA'S VOICE
Really, which one? I bet it was the
guy with the Prada shoes.
DANNY
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did
your mother know he was there?
CARLA'S VOICE
I doubt it. How did you find out?
DANNY
He called me up. He wanted to talk to
me about my ideas.
CARLA
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody
who talks such a good game ever plays
one.
DANNY
You weren't complaining about my play
last time.
CARLA'S VOICE
That's a much easier game.
DANNY
Why don't you come visit, we'll have
a rematch.
CARLA
Too many good players down here. I'm
with one right now.
DANNY
Oh, really?
CARLA
Bigger and better.
DANNY
Then how come you're talking to me?
CARLA'S VOICE
I'm not.
Click. She's gone. He hangs up, walks straight into...
Danny, Billings, O.L., and Drake walk through the town,
looking for trouble. A couple of local TEENAGERS watch them,
impressed by the swastikas, tattoos, swagger.
A horse hitched to a hay wagon; FARMER driving. THREE NAZI
SOLDIERS have discovered a Jewish family hiding in the hay.
A sergeant is holding up something unseen on the end of his
rifle.
The Polish man who has been telling the story looks up at
whatever it is. Blood falls on him. The Nazis are laughing.
POLISH MAN (O.S.)
When the blood stopped, the sergeant
pushed my son off the bayonet and
said, "There, you can have him now...."
Kyle opens the trunk of his car, shows Danny inside: two
bags of shotgun powder and several lengths of metal piping
with screw-on caps.
DANNY
What is it?
KYLE
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe
bombs.
(off Danny's reaction, smiles)
A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me.
A donation to the cause.
CARLETON (O.S.)
Hey, Danny.... Guess who's here....
(as Danny quickly slams
the trunk)
Your girlfriend... She's up at the house.
In the driveway: Carla's Mercedes, a Triumph motorcycle.
Danny peers in through the windows, goes to the door.
Danny is parked opposite a fortresslike building of soiled
brick. For a long time he cannot bring himself to get out.
Finally he opens the door....
He stops beneath an open window through which he hears...
RABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE
...Grant us peace, thy most precious
gift, O Thou Eternal source of peace.
We recall with loving memory those
whom Thou hast summoned unto thee.
And we mention by name...Sophie
Budnitz...Bernard Schwabb...Milton
Lifter...Aaron Lustig...Minnie Baum...
Danny closes his eyes, but at the end adds, under her breath:
DANNY
...Harriet Kantor Balint...
A half dozen VOICES, including Danny's, recite in unison...
DANNY & OTHERS
Yis-ga-dal v'yis-ka-dash sh'may ra-bo...
The body of the congregation joins in on certain phrases,
producing a subtle and solemn music. Danny chants the entire
prayer, and the moment it ends, and the rabbi begins the
benediction....
RABBI'S VOICE (AMPLIFIED)
May the Lord bless you and keep you....
...he starts toward his car. But the Rabbi's VOICE seems to
follow him, unnaturally loud and clear:
RABBI (O.S.)
May He cause the light of His
countenance to shine upon you and be
gracious unto you....
DANNY
(to himself)
Eat shit....
RABBI (O.S.)
...May you be blessed in your going
forth as you were in your coming....
DANNY
(shouting to the empty street)
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
RABBI (O.S.)
And let us say...
RABBI & CONGREGATION
(with organ; singsong)
Ah -- ah -- ah....men....
As Danny reaches the van, he sees the LARGE WOMAN silhouetted
in the open doorway....
LARGE WOMAN
YOU EAT SHIT.
Danny realizes he's still wearing the kippah. He throws it
at her, but it only goes a couple of feet. He catches it,
throws harder. This time it floats back toward him, and he
has to jump out the way to keep it from hitting him. He gets
in the car and drives off.
A WRISTWATCH: 12:05. We are:
Danny hoists himself onto the kitchen roof. Above him is an
open window, candlelight flickering. He starts into the room,
stops....
A VIDEO IMAGE:
NEWSCASTER VOICE (V.O.)
...Tragedy was barely averted today
at Temple Ahavat Torah when a bomb
planted under the bema failed to
detonate....
KYLE (O.S.)
Shit!
NEWSCASTER VOICE (V.O.)
...Authorities say that if it had,
injuries and loss of life could have
been in the dozens....
GUY'S VOICE (PHONE)
Danny Balint...Guy Danielsen, New
York Times.
DANNY
(tucks in the tallis
fringes)
What do you want? What happened to
your article?
GUY'S VOICE (PHONE)
I couldn't get my editor to run it,
but I bet he will now that you've put
a bomb in a synagogue. That was you,
wasn't it, Danny?
Danny hangs up. Stands there. A VOICE makes him jump....
VOICE (DRAKE)
Hey, Danny, want to kill a Jew?
Danny turns: it's Drake. These are the first words he's spoken.
Danny and Drake pass a low-slung modern synagogue. A sign
announces: AMBASSADOR ILIO MANZETTI Friday, August 31. Danny
reacts, startled...Drake smiles.
DRAKE
Park up there, we'll walk back.
The building is lit. Within we hear an AMPLIFIED VOICE,
presumably Manzetti giving a speech. We can't make out the
words. Danny and Drake are hidden among the rhododendrons
flanking the parking lot. Danny is watching a door in the
side of the building and eating a sandwich as Drake loads a
scoped rifle.
DRAKE
Lie on your stomach and come up on
your elbows.
DANNY
Why me?
DRAKE
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
Danny assumes the prone position, Drake sets the rifle in
his hands.
DANNY
Who'd you kill?
DRAKE
Four. But no one this important.
We hear APPLAUSE within as the speech ends.
DRAKE
Okay, it's over. He'll take a couple
questions, then come out.... Sight
down the rifle toward the door.
THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE: Danny pans from the side door -- where
TWO MEN are smoking -- to a waiting limousine.
DANNY
How did you know they were Jews?
DRAKE
I can tell....
DANNY
How?
DRAKE
I was a Jew in a previous life.
Before Danny can respond, Drake gestures toward the synagogue.
DRAKE
Here they come.
Danny puts his eye back to the scope.
SCOPE POV: stirring at the door. The men put out their
cigarettes. Three figures emerge: a MAN and a WOMAN on
either side of an older, distinguished-looking man (MANZETTI).
They walk this way.
DRAKE (O.S.)
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a
Jew in the head.
DANNY
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
DRAKE (O.S.)
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With
those shells, anywhere you hit him,
it'll bounce around, rip his insides
all up.
SCOPE POV: the TRIO walking this way, cross-hairs on Manzetti.
DRAKE (O.S.)
Right there! Just squeeze he trigger.
Slow... Do it!
Danny FIRES, misses. Everybody hits the ground.
DRAKE
You missed on purpose.
DANNY
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
DRAKE
What's that?
Danny looks over his shoulder. His shirt has ridden up his
back, revealing the tallis wrapped around his waist.
DRAKE
I knew it.
Drake pulls a .45 from the duffel.... Without thinking,
Danny rolls over, fires the rifle. Drake is blown backward,
dropping the .45.
Danny leaps up.... Drake's on his hands and knees, his
trousers quickly darkening with blood. Danny's upset.
DANNY
Oh, Jesus...Drake, are you okay...?
FOOTSTEPS, coming this way. Danny runs. We hear voices, "Get
down.... Stay down.... He's got a gun...." Drake picks
himself up, stumbles away, bent over....
Danny parks the van in an abandoned lot near the river.
Quickly wiping down the wheel with his shirt, he tosses out
his duffel bag and the scoped rifle. He climbs out, wipes
down the door, throws the rifle into the water, grabs the
duffel and hurries away.
DANNY (V.O.)
Kyle, it's me Danny. How you doing?...
I had to come into the city to see
Mrs. MOEBIUS... No, I gave Drake the
van, didn't he bring it back?
Danny comes out of the building, squats between two parked
cars and vomits, retching spastically until, gasping for
breath...
VOICE
Here...
He turns. Carla walks over to him, wipes his mouth with a
crumpled tissue. When she moves to kiss him, he holds back,
shy about the smell, but she kisses him anyway, on the mouth.
Danny and Kyle.
KYLE
This will be a different kind of device.
DANNY
That damn thing. You know how it made
me look...?
KYLE
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen
again. I'm going to use a brand-new
power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up
timer.
DANNY
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm
serious. I'm always talking about it.
This time it's gotta happen.
KYLE
It will.
Kyle's confident, and the prospect of this really happening
gives Danny pause. He feels a brief chill, escapes it with...
DANNY
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
KYLE
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows
where he went.
Danny nods, gestures for Kyle to split. Kyle looks around,
walks away. Danny waits a moment, then heads in the opposite
direction.
Danny walking behind a Hasidic family (MAN, WOMAN, 3-year-
old BOY, STROLLER)...watching them. At a corner, the father
takes the boy's hand, and as they cross the street, the boy
glances back at Danny.
TWO NAZI SOLDIERS have just discovered a JEWISH FAMILY
hiding in the back of a hay wagon. The POLISH MAN is holding
the little boy.
As a soldier tries to take the BOY out of his arms, the
child panics, clings to his father, screaming, "Papa...
Papa..." It is the scene the survivor described in the
meeting with the Nazis. But now the father is DANNY'S
FATHER....
FATHER (IN POLISH)
...Hush, come on, don't cry.
Everything will be all right....
A Nazi sergeant comes over, irritated. The sergeant is Danny.
DANNY/NAZI SERGEANT
(in German)
What's the matter here?
FATHER
(to the Sergeant, in German)
Excuse me, I'm sorry, just a moment...
The sergeant rips the child out of his arms. The kid becomes
hysterical. The father manages to take the boy's hand.
FATHER
(in Polish)
Please, sweetheart, you have to go.
I'll see you soon.
In an access of disgust, the sergeant sticks his bayonet
into the boy -- or rather, into something offscreen. We hear
a terrible sound, the child grunts. The family gasps in horror.
Danny/sergeant lifts the (unseen) child into the air. Its
SHADOW darkens the father's face. Drops of blood run down
his cheeks....
Danny/sergeant stares into the father's face, enraged at the
man's passivity.
DANNY/NAZI SERGEANT
Fucking kike.
DANNY'S FACE -- sweating, haunted, as if he's just woken
from the previous.
He's still walking down the street, but now, as if to flee
his thoughts, he steps through a door into...
Danny and Kyle sitting in the tall grass across the
marshlands toward the Manhattan skyline shimmering in the
distance.
KYLE
(sings, looking at watch)
"My country 'tis of thee, Sweet land
of liberty, Of thee I..."
He points sharply and an explosion occurs thirty yards away.
They run over, pick up the mangled timer. They're pleased.
A couple of stragglers hurry through the door as we hear...
VOICES
B'Rosh Hashanah yika-teyvun, uv'yom
tsom kippur yey-chateymun...
Miriam and Danny walk down West End Avenue together. He's
oddly relaxed with her?
MIRIAM
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
DANNY
(after a beat)
To hear them read Torah.
MIRIAM
I thought you hated Torah.
DANNY
That doesn't mean I don't like
hearing it.
MIRIAM
Point out all the lies and fucked-up
thinking.
She smiles and even he smiles a little. They walk together,
oddly companionable.
MIRIAM
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked
on a desert island. When they rescue
him, they see he's built two
synagogues. They say, for vhat do you
need two synagogues? He says, vun to
pray in, and vun I'd never set foot
in so long as I live, so help me God.
(he nods, he's heard it)
You pray in the one you'd never set
foot in...and vice versa.
DANNY
I can't help what I think.
MIRIAM
This is me.
She stops in front of a nice doorman building. He's impressed.
MIRIAM
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
DANNY
(startled)
How did you...?
MIRIAM
I work in the DA's office. You go to
those meetings, half the people there
are informants.
DANNY
You mean the Times guy?
MIRIAM
Which Times guy?
DANNY
With the shoes... There was more than
one?
In an excess of paranoia, he walks away. She calls after him....
MIRIAM
Danny...Danny...
(he doesn't look back)
Shit...
Danny wanders out the door in a daze. His cell phone RINGING.
He has to search his pockets, then fumbles to turn it on....
KYLE'S VOICE (PHONE)
You finally killed a Jew, man. How's
it feel?
DANNY
Kyle...I can't talk right now....
He hears a CAMERA SHUTTER and MOTOR DRIVE. He turns....
GUY DANIELSEN & A PHOTOGRAPHER.
They're coming toward him.
GUY
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
DANNY
No.
Suddenly Danny runs after the photographer, they struggle....
PHOTOGRAPHER
Not the camera, don't hurt the camera...
Danny opens the camera, rips out the film, exposing it.
GUY
Did you kill him?
Danny glares at him without answering, walks away. Guy
hurries after him....
GUY
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi
rally. Last week you went to a Torah
study group.
DANNY
What were you, following me?
GUY
How do you reconcile the two?
DANNY
I don't. Look, stay out of what you
don't understand.
GUY
Explain it so I can.
DANNY
You work for the New York Times. Your
whole job in life is not to understand
things like me.
GUY
I don't think you know what you are.
DANNY
(walking on, fast)
Yeah, and what are you? A Times man?
A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
GUY
Who killed Manzetti?
DANNY
If I tell you, will you pull the
story? Not write about me?
GUY
It's too late.... If I didn't,
somebody else would.
(as Danny just snorts)
Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will
you go to synagogue?
DANNY
(turns on him, threatening)
Get the fuck away from me.
Guy backs off. Danny crosses the street.
VOICE
Hey, Danny, just one more!
He glances back. It's the PHOTOGRAPHER who has reloaded and
now SNAPS a shot AS DANNY TURNS AWAY and keeps going....
Danny and Miriam walking together among the trees.
MIRIAM
You're telling me you killed him? You?
Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of
gun did you use?
DANNY
(guessing)
A forty-five.
MIRIAM
It was a nine millimeter.
DANNY
You're lying.
MIRIAM
So are you... But they'll believe
you....
(as they walk)
Lina Moebius is saying the whole
thing was your idea. That you
proposed it in a meeting at her house.
(when he doesn't deny it)
Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you
thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's
dead? Do you really want to kill Jews?
You want to kill me?
DANNY
I was just talking. I -- look, I
can't help what I think.
He doesn't know how to answer, walks away from her to the
railing overlooking the water. He stares into the current
flowing past. Finally Miriam joins him....
MIRIAM
All right, what if all along you were
actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to
expose them....
DANNY
But I wasn't.
MIRIAM
And only talked about killing
Manzetti to convince them you were an
anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea
somebody would take it seriously, you
never would have said it.
DANNY
I can't say that.
MIRIAM
Think about your father. Your sister.
DANNY
The truth doesn't mean anything to
you, does it?
MIRIAM
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
DANNY
(over her)
Fucking kike.
Miriam is stung. She can't believe he said that. Still, she
gets a small tape recorder out of her purse, hands it to him.
MIRIAM
Try to get Lina Moebius on tape,
telling you to do something.
Something violent... That's right, I
don't care about truth. I care about
you.
(looks at her watch)
Kol Nidre's at six-thirty. I've got
to meet Stuart. We'll be at the
minyan tonight and tomorrow. If you
need me, come there....
Danny watches her walk away, then turns to the railing.
Ideally a FERRY is pulling away from its slip and heading
out across the harbor. He watches it, then looks down at the
current moving past. He reaches a decision, throws the tape
recorder into the water, turns and walks away....
Danny on a phone. Behind him, Jews hurry home for the
holiday. He hears a BEEP...
DANNY
Miriam, it's me, Danny.... Come on,
the holiday hasn't started, pick up
the --
(as someone does)
...Is Stuart davening Ne'ilah
tomorrow at the minyan... 'Cause he
always does... Tell him I'm doing it
instead....
She argues (we hear her VOICE not her words)...Danny cuts
her off.
DANNY
Miriam, I'm davening.... He gives me
any trouble, I'll beat the shit out
of him right there in the room. I'm
serious....
She's still talking when he hangs up and walks away.
DANNY
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
LINA
What is happening?
DANNY
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
LINA
Beth Shalom? What are you talking
about? Who is this...?
DANNY
Lina, you said if I was going to
plant a bomb, I should --
A CLICK as she hangs up. He's pleased. He steps away from
the phone. He's carrying a grease-stained bag and is across
from...
TEMPLE EMANU-EL...KOL NIDRE being sung by a soprano within;
and ORGAN accompanying her.
In the synagogue across the street we hear KOL NIDRE being
sung by a soprano; an ORGAN accompanying her. Danny looks up
at the temple.
Looking up as the Nazi sergeant holds the boy on the bayonet
over the father's head. But now Danny is the father, and the
father is the sergeant.
He lunges at the Nazi, knocking him down, tearing at this
throat. The sergeant screams....
NAZI SOLDIER
(in German, to his fellows)
Kill him!
Danny bites through the Nazi's jugular as bullets rip into him.
POV inside van. Fifth is quiet. Temple Emanu-el again,
straight ahead. But now we see SECURITY GUARDS near the door.
KYLE (V.O.)
Oh, what is this shit?
DANNY (V.O.)
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
KYLE (V.O.)
Christ...
POV speeds up, whips past the synagogue.
DANNY (V.O.)
Not too fast.
KYLE (V.O.)
You said they didn't have night guards.
DANNY (V.O.)
They don't. I checked twenty times....
Somebody must have talked.
KYLE (V.O.)
Who even knew?
DANNY (V.O.)
Mrs. Moebius.
KYLE (V.O.)
Why? Why would she?
DANNY (V.O.)
The Manzetti thing must have scared
her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
KYLE (V.O.)
So what do we do with the device?
The Plaza straight ahead...
DANNY (V.O.)
Take a right on 59th...
(as the car turns)
We'll put it someplace else.
KYLE (V.O.)
Where?
ON DANNY'S FACE
DANNY
I have an idea....
Kyle and Danny come around the corner, get in Kyle's car
parked near the side door.
A stack of papers, the early edition of the Times. As Danny
grabs one, he notices a stack of tabloids....
FRONT PAGE: The Manzetti crime scene with screaming headline:
"MANZETTI SLAYER JEWISH NAZI." Next to this another tab:
"JEW KILLS JEW?"
Danny grabs a Times, flips it over... We see only his face:
registering this, unsurprised. He opens the paper....
INSERT: TWO PHOTOGRAPHS
The sweet-faced bar mitzvah boy we saw at his father's
house... And a BLURRY PHOTO of Danny walking away from Guy
Danielsen and the photographer outside Mrs. Moebius's house.
Danny's face is not clearly seen.
TILT UP TO DANNY
Calm. He tucks the paper under his arm beside the machzor
and crosses Eighth Avenue toward a cheap hotel....
CHEAP HOTEL -- NIGHT
Carrying the papers, Danny goes through the door.
As Danny approaches, a STOCKY YOUNG MAN on a folding chair
outside the front door checks him out.
DANNY
Gamar tov.
The Stocky Young Man beckons him on. As he passes, Danny
spots a gun and shoulder holster inside the man's zippered
jacket.
The Jewish father (played by Danny's father) is ripping open
the Sergeant's jugular as the soldiers shoot him. One of the
soldiers (who is now Danny) says:
DANNY/NAZI SOLDIER
Kill them. Kill them all.
The soldiers begin firing.... But now, three Israeli
commandos appear, Danny, Avi and the security guard we saw
outside. They fire Uzis at the Nazis, who fire back.
Danny the Nazi soldier and Danny the Israeli commando fire
at each other at point-blank range. The SOUND fades and we
hear SCRAPING CHAIRS, MURMURS, VOICES....
As Kyle, Drake and Billings approach, the place seems to
glow with an inner radiance. Drake and Billings hold weapons
at their sides.
The stocky security guard sees them coming and gets up,
reaching for his gun. Billings and Drake stop. Kyle wishes
he weren't here.
Everything suspends for a moment as, within the building,
three distinct GROUPS OF VOICES can be heard, each chanting
the AVINU MALKENU at a slightly different point in the prayer.
Drake raises his gun and fires.
