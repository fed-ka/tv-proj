      ELLIE HARLOW (30s, attractive, slight edge) is on the deck of 
      a huge yacht circling New York Harbor, a raucous record 
      release party for a hip hop artist.  It s a warm and breezy 
      evening, a tattooed shoulder peeks out of Ellie s sleeveless 
      top.  Near the DJ booth, Ellie pours champagne from her glass 
      over the railing of the ship.  Her sexy, artsy, hipster 
      friend, VANESSA (early 30s, ethnicity open, lavender streak 
      in her hair) approaches, winded from dancing.

                                    VANESSA
                    Hey.  Why aren t you dancing?  The 
                    DJ is amazing.  And hot.

      Ellie pours some more champagne over the side and watches the 
      liquid drop two stories to the water below.  

                                  ELLIE
                    It s so weird.  The drops hang in 
                    the air for a split second before 
                    they fall.  

                                    VANESSA
                    He keeps making eye contact with me 
                    on the dance floor.  

      Ellie pours the rest of her drink over side.

                                  ELLIE
                    See?  They just hang there.
                          (off her look)
                    You think that happens to people? 

      Ellie intentionally drops the empty champagne glass over the 
      side, watches it fall.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    No.  They probably just fall.  
                          (then)
                    Guess I need another drink. 

      Vanessa can sense Ellie s a little off.

                                    VANESSA
                    Ellie, are you alright?                          Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 2


                                  ELLIE
                          (smiles)
                    More than alright.

      Ellie looks out to the twinkling lights of the New York 
      skyline.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    Look at the lights, the city... 
                    it s a perfect Friday night.

      Ellie throws a look to the DJ, smiles.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    You should go talk to the hot DJ.  

                                    VANESSA
                    Are you sure?

                                  ELLIE
                    Seize the moment, Vanessa.  This is 
                    why we live in New York.

                                    VANESSA
                          (after a beat)
                    You re right.

      Ellie smiles as Vanessa moves off.  But once Vanessa is gone, 
      Ellie s expression changes, turns serious.  Ellie STEPS UP on 
      to the railing and balances precariously.  The wind whips her 
      hair as she takes a long look at the lights of the city.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



      Ellie takes a last look out at the city, takes a breath and 
      then DIVES off the ship, INTO THE BLACK WATER BELOW!



      The Man walks down a bustling street with a briefcase and 
      confidently heads into an office building with a sign:  
      CAPITAL PARTNERS.                          Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 3



      Ellie is submerged under the dark, cold water of the East 
      River, a half-mile away from shore.  She opens her eyes in 
      the blackness, looks up to the surface, sees the flicker of a 
      an oncoming headlight accompanied by a LOUD, OMINOUS HUM.



      Ellie surfaces to see a huge BARGE coming right towards her.  
      She floats passively, RIGHT IN ITS PATH.  As the massive 
      barge BEARS DOWN on her we--

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:



      It s morning as the Man is unloaded from a police car by two 
      cops, BREEN and SOUTHERLAND, outside Bellevue Hospital s ER.  
      The man is agitated, hands cuffed behind his back.  

                                  MAN
                    It s all the zeros and the ones and 
                    the zeros.

      Technological singularity is Hang in there sir, we are 
      upon us.  Evolution has been  here.*almost

      As they burst through the double doors, we EXPERIENCE the 
      bustle of the ER from the POV of a man in the midst of a 
      psychotic episode:  colors are brighter, sounds are 
        exaggerated.  It s a woozy, distorted view of the blood and 
      chaos in the ER.  ER nurse DAHLIA takes one look and can 
      immediately tell it s a psych case.  She points down the 
      hall.

                                  DAHLIA
                    Psych ER is that way.

      They round a corner, go through a set of doors into--



      It's a continuation of Ellie s night in the East River the 
      night before.  Ellie lies motionless as the GIANT BARGE 
      passes by her, mere inches away.  It s a chilling, scary 
      tableau.  Over this, we hear a female voice.  

                                  FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                    Join us... come join us.

      The voice is garbled, dreamlike.  As if it s emanating from 
      the watery depths. 



      In what appears to be a further continuation of the prior 
      night in the East River, we see Ellie submerged in cold, blue 
      water.  We are in Ellie s POV as she looks up, the light on 
      the surface collapsing to a pinpoint, then disappearing all 
      together.  



      22-year-old unconscious Ellie is abruptly YANKED from the 
      water and PULLED up on to the deck of a coast guard boat.  We 
      realize we are not seeing NY Harbor the night before-- It s 
      daytime, six years ago, Lake Michigan.  The Mackinac Bridge 
      is visible in the background.  The wind whips the jacket of 
      the weathered COAST GUARD who pulls her out.  He checks her 
      vitals, then turns to his partner.  

                                  COAST GUARD
                    She s breathing.  Call it in.

      The coast guard throws a thermal blanket on her as his 
      partner radios:

                                  COAST GUARD (CONT D)

                    Send a rig to base, we ve got 
                    another jumper.

      Ellie s eyes flutter open.  We PUSH IN on Ellie s face as we--



      Ellie and Diane burst out onto the busy street in front of 
      Bellevue, on the move.  Diane is a combination of angry and 
      perplexed.

                                  ELLIE 
                    I told you, I have an issue with 
                    talk therapy, okay?  The coddling, 
                    the unequivocal support.  It 
                    doesn t do anyone any good.

                                  DIANE
                    Oh, and provoking a psych patient 
                    into a violent outburst is 
                      effective? 

                                  ELLIE
                    Give me the guys hearing voices or 
                    barking like a dog, I can help 
                    them.  But let someone else talk to 
                    them about their childhood.  That s 
                    why I chose Bellevue instead of 
                    some cushy private practice--

      They continue walking down the street.

                      hyponatremic.  I m sorry.  You were 
                    totally right about everything.
                          (then)
                      Everything.

      Ellie stops, emotional.

                                  ELLIE
                    Maybe being right isn t enough.

                                  KNOX
                    Whoa.  What s going on?  

                                  ELLIE
                    It s nothing... long day. 

      ON Ellie as she wipes her eyes and moves off.

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:



      Ellie is sitting alone on a dock in front of her childhood 
      home, a blanket wrapped around her.  She holds an ice pack to 
      a bloody gash on her head, incurred in the ambulance jump.  A 
      25-year-old man, TOM, approaches the front steps.

                                  TOM
                    Are you crazy?  You could have 
                    died.

                                  ELLIE
                    But I didn t.

                                  TOM
                    The cops are looking for you.

                                  ELLIE
                    I didn t jump, Tom.  I fell.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 53


                                  TOM
                    What s the difference?  You were 
                    climbing suspension cables.  For 
                    fun.



                                  TOM
                    The hang gliding, the drinking, 
                    screwing that coke dealer... Tell, 
                    me, Ellie.  What the hell are you 
                    doing?



      PUSH IN on Ellie, eyes welling with emotion, trying to answer 
      Tom s question as we-- 



      Ellie stands on the roof of the hospital, looking out to an 
      expansive view of the East River.  

                                  MALE VOICE
                    What the hell are you doing up 
                    here?

      Ellie looks back and sees Knox.                        Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 60


                                  KNOX
                    I saw you in the hallway, you went 
                    into a utility closet.  When you 
                    didn t come out, I got curious.  
                    Thought you might be Wonder Woman 
                    or something.

                                  ELLIE
                    ... I came up to see the view.  
                    A janitor told me about the hatch 
                    to the roof.   

                                  KNOX
                    I can think of easier ways to see 
                    the river, psycho.  Have a drink at 
                    the Onyx Cafe.  Go running on York 
                    Avenue.  Hell, get right out there 
                    on a kayak.

                                  ELLIE
                    I don t know... 

      Ellie looks out at the water, seems pensive as the wind blows 
      her hair.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    ... Sometimes I have a weird need 
                    to do things the hard way.  



      A continuation of the earlier flashback.  Tom is angry.

                                  TOM
                    You want to be like her?  Go buy a 
                    pack of razor blades, it would be 
                    easier.  Because I m sick of the 
                    cops calling about my suicidal 
                    sister.

      Ellie looks at him, adrift.  Tom instantly regrets his words. 

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    Sorry, El.  I m sorry.  I know it s 
                    been hard.  But you know what?  
                    We re all hurting.

                                  ELLIE
                    I m not.  I m not hurting.

                                  TOM
                    Then what the hell is this about?                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 61


                                  ELLIE
                    It s about just that-- I m not 
                    hurting.  Something changed.  
                      Something s wrong with me.

                                  TOM
                    Nothing s wrong with you.  You re 
                    in shock.

                                  ELLIE
                    It s been over a year.  And all I 
                    know is... numbness... 
                      nothingness... it s so much worse 
                    then grief.  

                                  TOM
                    So, what?  You want to give up?  
                    You want to die?

                                  ELLIE
                    No.  I don t.  Bridges, cliffs, 
                    drugs, sex-- it s all the same.  
                    All about one thing...



      Ellie seems inexplicably emotional, shaken, as she turns back 
      to look Knox in the eye.

                                  ELLIE
                    ... I want to feel like I m alive.  

      Ellie collects herself, smiles.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    So where does one rent a kayak?



      The next morning.  Ellie walks down a busy NYC street.  Her 
      phone buzzes, it s Vanessa.  INTERCUT WITH:



      Ellie emerges from the rowing club building, heads down a 
      dock, surveying the kayaks.



      Music continues.  Ellie rows out on the river, taking in the 
      expansive views of the city.  She picks up speed as her oars 
      slice cleanly into the water, embarking on a new chapter of 
      her life.     

                                                                          FADE OUT.
