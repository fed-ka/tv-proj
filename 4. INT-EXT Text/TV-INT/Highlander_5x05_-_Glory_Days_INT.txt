      A hallway featuring luxury brass and glass doors to the DELIO
      GROUP offices, closed and locked.  On either side of the
      doors are lush potted plants, spotlighted by track lights. 
      Above one of the plants, a puff of SMOKE swirls into the
      light.

      ANGLE - A PLANT

      in the shadow, a man leans against the wall.  JOHNNY KELLY
      appears tall, broad shouldered, long coat and gloves.  A
      fedora pulled low hides most of his face.

      He takes a leisurely drag off the cigarette in his free hand,
      keeping his eyes trained on the elevator.  Waiting.


      DeLio and Bobby cross the lobby, passing the front desk,
      where the GUARD is dozing.  Bobby coughs loudly and the Guard
      snaps to attention, embarrassed.

                                      GUARD
                    Morning, Mr. DeLio.  Sir.

      DeLio glares and keeps moving to the elevator.  Bobby pushes
      the button.96504      "Glory Days"      2.      Final Shooting Script 7/29/96




      ANGLE - THE ELEVATOR as with a BING the doors open, and DeLio
      and Bobby step out.

      Bobby sees waiting ahead of them by the plant -- JOHNNY.

                                      BOBBY
                    You know him, sir?

      DeLio looks, shakes his head, unconcerned.

                                      DELIO
                    Take care of it.

      Bobby starts for him.  As he does, Johnny casually drops his
      cigarette, crushes it out with his foot.

                                      BOBBY
                          (advancing)
                    What the hell you doing?

      Johnny calmly raises his right arm -- we now see he holds a
        silencer-equipped AUTOMATIC.

      Bobby freezes, his hand goes to his coat -- too slow.  The
      gun POPS -- Bobby spins and drops, leaving --

      DELIO exposed and afraid, backing away.

                                      DELIO
                    Whatever you want, it's yours.  Name
                    it... I'll pay it!

      DeLio runs to the elevator, frantically pumps the button. 
      As the elevator doors start to open --

      Johnny shoots: two POPS.  DeLio crumples into the open
      elevator.

      The Guard glances at his of video screens.  He freezes:

      The Guard is up, racing for the elevator, pulling his gun as
      he does.

      Everything that follows is done with quick precision: THE

      of shoe-equipped STILTS with pant-legs attached.  The stilts
      come off.

      as he races to the landing.  Then we HEAR the sound of ROLLING

      Just as the Guard reaches the door, it SWINGS OPEN.  He levels
      his gun, ready to shoot as he faces --

      JOHNNY KELLY, in a baseball cap, looking younger than his
      years, is on a skateboard with a backpack and T-shirt -- no
      resemblance to the big assassin.  Seeing the gun, Johnny
      freezes in his tracks, stares wide-eyed.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Whoa.  Is that real?

      It's a light tenor voice -- no resemblance to the killer's
      rasp he used in the hallway upstairs.

      The Guard swings his gun away -- he almost shot a kid.

                                      GUARD
                    Son of a... !

                                      JOHNNY
                    Yeah.  He was running up to the

                    Get the hell out of here!

      The Guard slams through the doors, up the stairs.

                    Whatever you say.

      Johnny smiles -- it's not the smile of a kid.  He hops on
      his skateboard and shoves off, treats himself to a spin around
      the lobby before pulling a sharp turn and wheeling out the
      door.  As he does, we hear his voice coming back: it's a
      Jolson tune.

      FADE IN:


      Onstage, a BLUES BAND of fairly young musicians finishes its
      set with a slick guitar run and a drum flourish.  The crowded
      room breaks into appreciative applause.

      MacLeod is at the bar.  He turns back to Dawson on the other
      side.

                                      MACLEOD
                    They're good.  Where d you find them?

                                      DAWSON
                    At a dump on the waterfront playing
                    for overweight lap-dancers.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So Dawson rides to the rescue.

                                      DAWSON
                          (beat)
                    I got a soft spot for strays.

      Dawson's distracted by someone coming through the door. 
      Staring.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Can't be.

      MacLeod sees his face, follows his look over to --

      BETSY FIELDS

      She's looking hesitant as she moves toward the bar, eyes
      scanning the room for a place to sit.

      staring.

                                      DAWSON

                                      MACLEOD
                    Something wrong?

      Dawson just shakes his head.  He's shocked, but it's a
      pleasant, unexpected shock.  He watches her, a mix of emotions
      on his face, as she moves along the bar, eyes searching the
      table area.  Then, as she passes close enough that Dawson is
      certain --

                                      DAWSON
                    Betsy?

      She stares back with the same look he has: surprise, then
      growing pleasure.

                                      BETSY
                    Joe?  Joe Dawson?

      She's searching his face.  Dawson nods, a gentle smile.

                                      DAWSON
                    Only one I know of.

                                      BETSY
                    Joe, it is you!

      Shock turns to delight.  She holds out her arms and clasps
      Dawson's hands over the bar.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    I can't believe this!  What are you
                    doing here?

                                      DAWSON
                          (wry)
                    You see the sign outside?

                                      BETSY
                          (re the place)
                    This is yours.
                          (off his nod)
                    This is great.

                                      DAWSON
                    It is.  It really is.
                          (beat)
                    Here, sit, let me get you something.

      Dawson busies himself behind the bar.  MacLeod pulls a stool
      out for her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Please.

                                      DAWSON
                    Sorry.  Mac, this is Bet Fields.

      She laughs delightedly at the pet name.

      Dawson can only nod, not taking his eyes off her.  MacLeod
      watches with amused interest.

                    So tell me what you've been doing? 
                    I want to hear everything.

                    How about dinner?

      She's earnest, inviting.  Dawson evades her eyes.

                    storage locker to get a spare part.

      He shrugs -- got no choice.  Betsy nods, biting back her
      real disappointment, managing to force a smile.

                                      BETSY
                    Sure... Okay, some other time, maybe.

                                      MACLEOD

      She flashes him a winning smile and moves off.  She's no

      Johnny snaps on the light, hangs his board up next to several
      OTHER SKATEBOARDS hanging in a row.

      ANGLE - FAR WALL

      Johnny's "office".  On one side: rows of COSTUMES, STAGE
      MAKE-UP, WIGS and DISGUISES.  On the other side -- WEAPONS. 
      German HUNTING RIFLES, telescopic SIGHTS, KNIVES, PISTOLS,
      various ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS used to make bombs.  Your full-
      service hitman.

      Johnny opens his sack, pulls out the disguise from the
      previous day.  He rubs his hands as he smiles over his
      equipment.

      He reaches up, switches on a BOOM-BOX.  Incongruous vintage
      Jolson pours out.  The kid is older than he looks.  Way older.

      ANGLE - A CLIPBOARD

      and two photos there: One is DOMINIC DELIO, the dead man. 
      Beside it, a man with similar feature: MICHAEL DELIO, standing
      in front of DeLio s Tool & Die.  Johnny takes Dominic's photo
      down, tears it up, tosses in a garbage can.

                                      JOHNNY
                    One down...
                          (holding Michael
                            DeLio s photo)
                    One to go.

      He folds the photo and puts it into his pocket.  He sings
      along with the tape as he pulls out a comb, combs down his
      tousled modern 'do.96504      "Glory Days"      10.      Final Shooting Script 7/29/96




      An array of JUNK in precarious piles: an old neon BEER SIGN,
      TOOLS, a DRESSMAKER'S DUMMY, an old GUITAR AMP, a box with
      TOY TRAIN TRACKS.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Unbelievable.  I'm 400 years old, I
                    don't have this much junk.

      He starts to claw through boxes, finds a FOOTBALL, puts it
      aside and finally stops at -- a TOOL BOX.

      He pulls it out -- an avalanche of JUNK comes at him.  He
      backs into the DRESSMAKER'S DUMMY, rights it gingerly before
      it topples.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I'm not even gonna ask.

      He moves out of the locker with the tool box.


      Johnny is whistling cheerfully, cleaning the AUTOMATIC he
      used to kill DeLio.  He removes the CLIP, about to put it on
      the wall -- he feels the BUZZ.

      He slaps the CLIP back in the practiced motion and puts it
      down.  He reaches the wall, takes down his SWORD, then picks
      up the gun, shoves it in his back belt.  A hard smile.

      MacLeod in a Poker game with a some local jamooks, BIG GINO,
      about 280 pounds, JIMMY THE WEASEL, and another guy.

      They're in shirt sleeves and  heavy curtains keep out prying
      eyes.  Big Gino has the biggest cigar, so he's the boss.

      The atmosphere is relaxed.

                                      MACLEOD
                    See you...

                    And raise you five.

      More bills.  Smoke, money on the table, sweating glasses.

                    Call.

      But MacLeod is distracted as Johnny Kelly, same age as in
      the present, steps up and refills his glass with bootleg
      gin.  MacLeod eyes Johnny for a moment.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (defiant)
                    What?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Nothing.

      Johnny shrugs moves to the next player.  Jimmy taps his cards
      on the table impatiently, prompting MacLeod.

                    Three twos.

      Jimmy spreads his own cards.

                                      JIMMY
                    Ha!  Full house!

      Everybody groans.  Jimmy reaches for the pile of cash.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Hey, Gino.  For a sawbuck, I'll tell
                    you where he got that hand.  Whaddaya
                    say?

                                      JIMMY
                          (bridling)
                    I say you got a mouth on you, kid.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Yeah.
                          (smartass)
                    An' it's connected to two eyes.

      Jimmy starts to rise angrily.  MacLeod quickly picks up the
      empty bottle, shoves it at Johnny.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Here.  Go get us a refill before you
                    lose some teeth.  It's worth a buck.

      They all laugh.  Johnny exits, glad to have a task.  MacLeod
      turns to Big Gino.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Who's he?

                    Johnny K?  Just a neighborhood nobody. 
                    No friends, no family.  I'm trying
                    to keep him outta trouble.

      He shoves his chair back and heads out.  Big Gino scoops up
      the cards.

                    Who's in?

      MacLeod's eyes are on Jimmy as he leaves the place.


      The door slides open -- Tommy steps inside, his arm still on
      Johnny's shoulder.  Johnny's eyes widen.  In the floodlit
      warehouse, a couple of HOODS look on as --

      MR. LUCA

      dressed in natty GOLFING KNICKERS, complete with socks,
      sweater, white shoes, brings back his woody, and with lovely
      form, drives a ball out into --

      A LARGE NET

      hanging from the roof.  Stenciled words are hung, spread out
      on the net's backside: TRAP, LAKE, ROUGH, FAIRWAY.  The ball
      hits into the FAIRWAY area.

      RESUME LUCA

      He gives a satisfied nod to his "caddy" who holds his golf
      bag.  His smile fades as he sees Tommy with Johnny.

                                    LUCA
                    The hell is this, Tommy?  I'm working
                    on my backswing here.

      Tommy moves forward, whispers in Luca's ear.  Luca's look
      changes.  He gives Johnny an interested look.

                                    LUCA (CONT'D)
                    So waddaya want?  You wanna be one
                    of my boys?
                          (beat; casual)
                    Some guys wouldn't like people knowing
                    their business.  You know what I'm
                    sayin'?  Lotta guys would get
                      steamed... even i-rate...
                          (shrugs)
                    Me, I don't care.  Cause I know how
                    to take care of business.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I heard that.

      Johnny stands between Luca and the net.  Luca motions for
      his bag.

                                    LUCA
                    Ever golf?  Ever been 170 yards out
                    over water?

      Johnny shakes his head.  Luca considers his bag.

                                    LUCA (CONT'D)
                    Five iron might do it.  Even a four.

                    But in some situations, you've got
                    use a mashie.

      He reaches in the bag -- pulls out a SHOTGUN.  Johnny steps
      back in disbelief as Luca aims.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You can't!  I kept my mouth shut!  I
                    won't tell nobody... !

      BANG -- Luca blasts him.  Johnny flies back and down, hit in
      the gut.  He's dead.

                                    LUCA
                    This is true.

      Luca slides the shotgun back in the bag.  And OFF this --


      MacLeod is shuffling cards when his senses start tingling:
      an IMMORTAL is coming into being nearby.  He passes the cards
      to his left.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Think I'll call it a night.


      BLACKNESS.  A CRACKLING sound -- then a crack of LIGHT that
      widens, finally reveals Johnny's locker as the door opens
      and MacLeod enters a crowbar in his hand.

      MacLeod flicks on the light, moves around the room touching
      various items as he takes in the display of equipment.

      On the WEAPON WALL: A bristling array of weapons.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Well.  Now we know your line of work.


      MacLeod works with a wrench on the tap.  Dawson looks on.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He's unbelievable.  Talks like he's
                    still living in the twenties... and
                    that locker.  Weapons, disguises...
                    he's an assassin, Joe.  A pro.

                                      DAWSON
                    He was mentioned in the Chronicles
                    once or twice in the early years,
                    but after that --
                          (shrugs)
                    He pretty much disappeared.  I always
                    figured he got whacked, since nobody
                    saw him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Or nobody recognized him.  With those
                    costumes, he probably never looks
                    the same twice.
                          (beat)
                    And I almost let him take me.

      Dawson, on the other side of the bar, catches a washer that
      rolls toward him.

                                      DAWSON
                          (placating)
                    He shot you in the back.  Not exactly
                    kosher.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't think "kosher's" in his
                      vocabulary.
                          (beat)
                    He was a punk in '29 and he's a punk
                    now.  I should have known he'd try
                      something.
                          (re the tap)
                    Try it.

      Dawson pulls the tap.  Nothing happens.

                                      DAWSON
                    Well.  At least it doesn't leak.

      MacLeod grabs the wrench, starts on it again.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Shouldn't you be getting ready for
                    lunch about now?

      Dawson gets off the stool, avoiding, uncomfortable.

                                      DAWSON
                    She's not coming.
                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    I got things to do.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You lied to her?
                          (Dawson says nothing.)
                    To get out of a date?

      Dawson moves down the bar, tense, fiddles with the ashtrays. 
      MacLeod goes after him.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Why?

                                      DAWSON
                    Let it go, Mac.

      It's clear Dawson doesn't want to deal with it.  A technician
      on stage is running a soundcheck... FEEDBACK NOISE.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)

                    Blow that amp and you're out of here.

      The steam blown off for a moment.  MacLeod and Dawson share
      a look and Dawson finally opens up.

                    Sounds pretty good to me.

                                      DAWSON
                    It was great.

                    No.  Not going to, either.
                          (beat)
                    Far as she knows, I just went away
                    to war.
                          (beat)
                    I want to leave it that way.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Joe... you've never let this stop
                    you before.

                                      DAWSON
                          (musing)
                    You should've seen me, Mac.  I was
                    fast.  I could run... Damn, I could
                    do anything.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Joe, call her.  Take her to dinner.

      Dawson looks away, refusing to acknowledge MacLeod.

                    You can handle this.

      Dawson looks at him.  Naked, open, honest.

                                      DAWSON
                    No.
                          (beat)
                    No, I can't.

      He turns away, his face in turmoil.  And OFF this --


      Dawson at the wheel.  He checks himself out in the mirror,
      not so much for his appearance as to steel himself.  He takes
      a breath.

                                      DAWSON
                    Get a grip, buddy.  Just like walking
                    point.  No big deal.

      But it is.  He puts a hand on the door, as --


      MacLeod is inside.  It's empty.  Johnny's gone.  MacLeod
      leaves.96504      "Glory Days"      28.      Final Shooting Script 7/29/96




      MacLeod knocks on the open door.  The Manager, a muscular
      black man, comes to the door.

      MacLeod holds up the tool box.

                                      MACLEOD
                      I borrowed this from the guy, in 6-C
                    a while back.  Looks like he cleared
                    out early.  You got an address?

      The Manager walks back to his desk to look it up.


      Dawson and Betsy in an upscale place, music playing, a dance
      floor.

      They're sipping white wine, as Betsy finishes a story, Dawson
      laughing.

                                      DAWSON
                      Woodstock.  I can't believe your mom
                    let you go.

                                      BETSY
                    Who says she knew?  My god, Jimi
                    Hendrix, Neil Young, Country Joe and
                    the Fish... I'm surprised I remember
                    who played, the shape I was in. 
                    Five bathrooms for half a million
                    people, mud a foot deep...
                          (frowns)
                    Come to think of it, I don't think I
                    had all that much fun.
                          (beat, warmly)
                    But I wish you'd been there.

                                      DAWSON
                    Me too.
                          (wry)
                    Had a little mud of my own to wade
                    through.

      He means 'Nam.  She nods.  Downs her glass of wine and takes
      a deep breath.

                                      BETSY
                    Joe...
                          (beat)
                    I have a confession to make.

      She's serious, gearing up for something.  Dawson, fearing
      what she might say, tries to deflect it with a joke.

                                      DAWSON
                    You really liked the Monkees?

                                      BETSY
                    No.  Well, yes, but that's not the
                    point.
                          (earnest)
                    It wasn't an accident that of all
                    the gin joints in all the world, I
                    walked into yours.

      Dawson listens as he pours her a glass of wine.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    A couple months ago I saw an article
                    on an airplane about blues clubs in
                    different cities... one of them
                    mentioned your name.
                          (beat)
                    I decided I'd take a chance.

                                      DAWSON
                          (reacting)
                    You came way out here to see me? 
                    After all this time?  Why?

                                      BETSY
                          (beat, shyly)
                    Didn't think I'd need to say it.

      Dawson is silent, taking this in, his hand tapping along
      with the music.  Betsy grows anxious.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    Joe?

                                      DAWSON
                          (suddenly)
                    You want to dance?

      She stares a BEAT, taken by surprise.

                                      BETSY
                    You don't have to, really...

                                      DAWSON
                    I know I don't have to.  Do you want
                    to dance?

      Betsy nods, smiling, uncertain how to handle this.  Dawson
      stands and takes her hand, pulls her up.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Nothing to it.  I'll lead.

      Betsy moves into his arms, tentative.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Don't worry, I won't step on your
                    toes.

      They look in each other's eyes.  The magic coming back.  He
      pulls her closer.  She melts into his shoulder.

      CAMERA CIRCLES around them as they move to the music.  Betsy
      is dreamy, and slightly sad.  Dawson's hand touching her
      hair.  His eyes close as he moves.


      It's a fleabag, rented by the week.  Lights are on, the phone
      RINGING steadily.

      Someone rattling the door.  Finally it opens: MacLeod,
      breaking into Johnny's apartment.

      He enters cautiously, but there seems to be nobody home.  He
      reacts to the ratty furnishings.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Johnny?

      ANGLE - A TABLE

      and Johnny's HAT thrown on it, the only sign he was here. 
      The phone still RINGS.  MacLeod hesitates, picks up.

                                      JOHNNY (V.O.)
                          (over phone)
                    Never went to school, MacLeod... but
                    I can read you like a book.  That's
                    why I left my address for you.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (sarcastic)
                    Nice place you got here.  I guess
                    it's true -- crime doesn't pay.

                                                                                INTERCUT:


      Dawson and Betsy enter together, expansive, bubbling.

                                      BETSY
                    That was great.  I haven't had that
                    much fun since...

      BEAT.  She looks at him.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    Since you.

                                      DAWSON
                    Believe me, the pleasure was all
                    mine.

                                      BETSY
                    Not all of it.

      A BEAT.  She leans up, hesitant, then, and kisses him lightly
      on the lips.  Lingering.  Finally Dawson breaks, trying to
      rein in his feelings.  Both surprised at the intensity.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    Oh my.

                                      DAWSON
                          (taking a breath)
                    Betsy, I don't know... I mean, I
                    never expected...
                          (beat)
                    I think maybe I should go.

                                      BETSY
                    Why?  Is it past your bed time?

                                      DAWSON
                    No...

                                      BETSY
                          (teasing)
                    Some pressing engagement?  Midnight
                      auditions, maybe?

      Dawson is smiling in spite of himself.  She puts her hands
      on his chest, runs them lightly up and down his shirt.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    Or is that beer tap acting up again?

      She starts to unbutton his shirt.

                                      DAWSON
                    Look, Betsy, it's just...

      He fights his desire, suddenly stops her moving hands.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    You know.

      As if this explains it.  Betsy holds his eyes.

                                      BETSY
                    No.  I don't know.

                                      DAWSON
                          (in turmoil)
                    This is... it's moving a little fast. 
                    Maybe it's not a good idea.

                                      BETSY
                    It is if we want it to be, Joe.
                          (beat)
                    Do you want this?

                                      DAWSON
                    It's not that simple.

                                      BETSY
                    Right now it is.
                          (beat; with emphasis)
                    Do you want this?

      She's looking into his face, searching.  Dawson looking back,
      seeing it all there.  Everything he missed, wanted -- it's
      all still there.

                                      DAWSON
                    Yes.

      He lifts her face to his and they kiss deeply.  She pulls
      his shirt open, running her hands down his chest.

      ANGLE - THE WALL

      as his cane comes up, taps the light-switch OFF.

      behind him.  Dawson enters, whistling, cheerfully.

      MacLeod glances at him, sees the cheerful face.

                    I'm very happy for you.

                    You were right.  You should have
                    seen her.  She was beautiful.  It
                    was incredible.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm glad, Joe -- but, I ve got a few
                    things on my mind.

                    then a bomb.

                    He likes to kill from a distance. 
                    And he s not playing by the rules.

                          (out loud)
                    Little bastard could be up on the
                    roof with a high powered rifle.

                                      DAWSON
                    Rifle?

      Dawson slides a little lower on the couch.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    You just going to sit here?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Oh, no.  I thought I d stroll outside
                    and let him shoot me.

      The phone RINGS.  MacLeod stays low, picks it up.

                                                                                INTERCUT:

      JOHNNY

      in a phone booth, anywhere.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                          (on phone)
                    How ya doin' MacLeod?  Hope you got
                    cable, 'cuz I can wait a long time.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (into phone)
                    I have books.  You ought to try
                    reading, Johnny.  You might learn
                      something.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You taught me all I need to know,
                    MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I have a proposition, Johnny.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You?  What have you got that I want? 
                    Besides your head?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're a hired gun, right?  What if
                    I hire you to point it somewhere
                    else?

                                      DAWSON
                          (shocked)
                    MacLeod?!

      MacLeod gestures -- I know what I'm doing.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Maybe.
                          (beat)
                    For two hundred G's.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Too much.  One hundred.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I might consider it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Meet me at Christ Church at three.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're a smart guy, MacLeod.  You
                    know when to cut your losses.  But
                    I'm warning you, don't screw with
                    me.

                                      MACLEOD
                      I wouldn't think of it.

      He hangs up.  Dawson staring at him.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're actually gonna go through
                    with this?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You bet.
                          (beat)
                    So are you.

      And OFF Dawson's baffled look --


      MacLeod waits under a stained glass window.

      Johnny comes sauntering in, all attitude.  He passes the
      FONT, pulls a comb from his pocket, dips it in the water,
      runs through his hair, he nods to MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Anyone ever tell you how to behave
                    on Holy Ground?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I never took too good to Sunday
                    School.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yeah, I remember.  You're Johnny K.
                    You were gonna be the toughest guy
                    in the neighborhood.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Not just the neighborhood, MacLeod. 
                    Luca learned that the hard way.
                          (a grin)
                    I got three grand for taking him
                    out.
                          (reveling)
                    You shoulda seen him.  The son-of-a-
                    bitch was on his knees begging.  He
                    was crying like a baby.
                          (beat)
                    I popped him and three of his boys
                    just for the hell of it.
                          (beat)
                    It was easy.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because you felt nothing.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You kidding?  I felt great.  I felt
                    like God.
                          (beat)
                    I'm the master of life and death.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What you are is a pathetic little
                    punk, Johnny.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Watch your mouth, MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (goading him)
                    You know how I know what a big man
                    you are?  I asked all your friends.
                          (beat)
                    Excuse me... you don't have any
                    friends.
                          (beat)
                    Tell me, Johnny, you ever make love
                    to a woman you didn't pay for?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I don't need nobody.  Not friends...
                    Not women...  Not you.
                          (beat)
                    All I want's my money.

      He holds out his hand.  MacLeod pats his pocket.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How about that?  Must have left it
                    in my other jacket.

                                      JOHNNY
                    A regular comedian.  You know how
                    many guys I killed, funny man?  Two
                    hundred and forty-nine.
                          (flaring)
                    You don't get it, do you?  Nobody
                    screws with me.  Nobody.

      MacLeod grabs him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No, you don't get it, Johnny.  You
                    won't play by the rules, fine.
                          (beat)
                    Then we play a new game.

      He shoves Johnny away.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're a dead man.  Dead!

      He storms out.


      Dawson is onstage, changing GELS on a spotlight when Betsy
      enters.

                                      DAWSON
                    Well, look who's here.

      He turns the light on her.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    My star.

      Betsy smiles, dazzled by the light.  Dawson swivels the light
      away so she can see.

                    minutes to clean up.
                          (beat)
                    Then dinner, dancing, who knows what
                    else.

                                      BETSY

                          (beat)
                    I have to go home.

      Right out of left field.  Dawson's face falls.

                                      DAWSON
                    Whaddya mean?  I thought you were
                    here 'til Friday.

                                      BETSY
                      Something's come up.  Business... I
                    have to get back.

      She's not telling everything, it's clear to Dawson.  He turns
      aside so she can't see his disappointment.

                                      DAWSON
                    Oh right.  Sure.  Fine.

      She comes around the side of the light, peers at him.

                                      BETSY
                    If I could stay, I would.

                                      DAWSON
                    I know...
                          (flaring)
                    I said it was fine.

      Betsy takes a step back.

                                      BETSY
                    It was great, seeing you.

                                      DAWSON
                          (looking away)
                    Same here.

      She turns and heads quickly for the door.

      Eyes locked on nothing.  His hands take a GEL, slide it over
      the spot, and it frames his face in blue light.  Cold, lost,
      distant blue.  HOLD on this.


      MacLeod is bent over some mechanical project.  He's
        industrious, humming as he works -- it's a TOY TRAIN, complete
      with track and cars.

                                            ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      MacLeod is rigging something to the kitchen phone, using the
      tools from Dawson's toolbox.  Dawson comes in.  MacLeod keeps
      working.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Grab a seat.

      Dawson doesn't.  He's unmistakably down.  MacLeod notices,
      but keeps working.  He has to finish.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (re the tools)
                    I'll drop them off tomorrow.

                                      DAWSON
                    Keep 'em.  It's not like I'm in a
                    hurry.
                          (beat)
                    The pictures work?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Like a charm.  Sent him right over
                    the edge.

                                      DAWSON
                            (distracted)
                    Great.

      MacLeod moves to the elevator, opens the gate.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Joe, you shouldn't be here.  This
                    won't be a safe place for a while.

      Dawson doesn't move.  Low:

                                      DAWSON
                    She's gone.  She's leaving me.

      BEAT.  MacLeod sees his face, lowers the gate.  Dawson is
      talking to himself.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    What the hell was I thinking?
                          (it's too painful)
                      I should've known.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Known what?

      Dawson angrily SMACKS his leg with his cane.

                                      DAWSON
                    What the hell do you think?!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat, quietly)
                    Did you talk to her?  Did you ask
                    her why she was leaving?

                                      DAWSON
                          (edgy)
                    What for?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because.  You owe it to her, Joe.
                          (beat)
                    And you owe it to yourself.

                                      DAWSON
                          (sarcastic)
                    Thank you, Dr. Ruth.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Look, we can take this up later.
                          (grim.)
                    I'm expecting some target practice.

      Dawson moves toward the elevator.

                                      DAWSON
                    Maybe I'll get lucky and he'll hit
                    me.

      They're at the elevator.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Talk to her.

      And OFF Dawson's face --


      Betsy is zipping up her garment bag when there's a knock on
      the door.  She calls over her shoulder --

                                      BETSY
                    Tell the driver I'll be down in a
                    second!

                                      DAWSON
                    If you want.

      She turns in surprise.  Dawson at the door.

                                      BETSY
                    Joe...
                          (beat, awkward)
                    I wasn't expecting you.

                                      DAWSON
                    You mind?

                                      BETSY
                    No, but I... I have to finish packing.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96504      "Glory Days"      46.      Final Shooting Script 7/29/96

      Feeling awkward, she goes to her bags.  Lays a red silk blouse
      on top.  The one she wore when they danced.

                                      DAWSON
                    I should have called first.

                                      BETSY
                          (a smile)
                    It's not like we're strangers, Joe.

                                      DAWSON
                    That's what I thought.

      He reaches into his pocket and removes a small box.  He hands
      it to her.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Something to remember me by.

                                      BETSY
                          (taking it)
                    Really, it's not necessary.

      Dawson doesn't look at her.  He turns toward the window,
      pulls the curtain aside to look out as he speaks.

                                      DAWSON
                    I think I know what's necessary.

      Betsy opens the box, takes out a gold pin.

                                      BETSY
                    It's beautiful.

      Betsy peering at him.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    Joe, are you okay?

                                      DAWSON
                    I thought I was.
                          (beat)
                    What I think is necessary for you...
                    I guess most people for that matter. 
                    What would be necessary would be --
                          (turning to her)
                    Legs.  At least one... preferably
                    two.
                          (beat)
                    Right?

      He's in pain, waiting for the answer.  She stares in
        astonishment -- the last thing she expected.

                    Betsy, I need to know.  Is that why
                    you're leaving?

      Betsy's expression changes.  Shaking her head, she understands
      the terrible mistake.

                                      BETSY
                          (beat)

                    thing...
                          (she takes a deep
                            breath)
                    I should have told you from the start. 
                    I just... I couldn't.

                                      DAWSON
                    Told me what?

      He's waiting.  She takes her handbag from the chair, opens
      the change purse.

      ANGLE - BETSY'S HANDS

      She pulls out a gold WEDDING BAND.

                                      BETSY

      Dawson stares.  The world is coming into focus.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're married?

                                      BETSY
                    All these years, Joe... all that
                    time, I never stopped thinking about

                    Just for a little while.

      Dawson is flushed with emotion.

      Touching her face tenderly, a touch of humor:

                                      DAWSON
                    I don't know about that.

                                      BETSY
                    I'm sorry...

      He touches his finger to her lips.

                                      DAWSON
                    Don't be.

      There's a KNOCKING at the door.

                                      BETSY
                    I have to go.

      Dawson, without moving his eyes off her, calls over his
      shoulder.

                                      DAWSON

      He smiles gently.  She puts a hand on his cheek, smiles back. 
      That's a "yes."


      An ominous angle that includes the phone and the window beyond --
      the line of fire.96504      "Glory Days"      49.      Final Shooting Script 7/29/96




      The kitchen is strewn with debris -- shattered glass, wires,
      a wig block.

      The old DRESSMAKER'S DUMMY from Dawson's locker, clothed in
      one of MacLeod's coats, is toppled on the floor, ripped by
      the bullets, with a network of LIONEL TRAIN TRACKS.

                                      DAWSON (O.S.)
                    I knew there was a reason I was saving
                    that thing.

      Dawson at the kitchen counter.  MacLeod is de-rigging the
        contraptions he used to fool Johnny.  He lifts model train
      tracks, detaches an ENGINE from the dummy stand.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                          (musing)
                    Funny.  I thought the risk was all
                    mine... Turns out I was wrong.

      He straightens the dummy up, looks at the holes.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I can get you a new one.

                                      DAWSON
                    Not a chance.  That storage room's
                    never been so clean.

      He notices the FOOTBALL from the storage room sitting on the
      counter.  Picks it up, idly.

      spiraling overhead, we --
