      A desolate stretch of beach, dotted by pickle weed and 
      verbena.  In the b.g., several SDPD secure a scene --
      unfurling YELLOW TAPE around something we can't yet see.

      CAMERA FINDS Molly, leaning against her Subaru Outback, parked
      at the edge of a fire road, abutting the sand.  Her 40 caliber
      Glock holstered over her shoulder and a DETECTIVE BADGE
      clipped to her belt.  A Ford Fusion pulls up beside Molly. 
      Brooke emerges, wearing her Glock and badge on her hip.  (We
      now realize they're both Detectives.)  On the move --

                                      BROOKE
                    Is it Chelsea?

                                      MOLLY
                          (doesn't know)
                    I was waiting for you.

                                      BROOKE
                    You'll never believe my morning.

                                      MOLLY
                    Mine either. 

      Before Molly can elaborate, Brooke jumps back in --

                                      BROOKE
                    Andrew proposed.

                                      MOLLY
                    Wow.  Congrats...  Wait.  What did
                    you say?

                                      BROOKE
                    I didn't.  We got the call out and --

      Brooke interrupts herself, points to Molly's left ear --

                                      BROOKE (CONT'D)
                    You're missing an earring.

      Molly touches her earlobe, winces as she recalls her morning. 
      She wants to confide in her partner, but this isn't the time
      or place -- especially given Brooke's news.                                                                                        8.

      As they cross under the yellow tape, all their focus goes to
      the case.

      Brooke photogs the female d.b, wearing only a bra and
      underwear, and facing away from CAMERA.  Molly grabs
      disposable latex gloves from her pocket, bends down, and
      gently turns the face to reveal --

                                      MOLLY
                    It's her. 
                          (a beat, then)
                    M.E. better hurry up.  Dune weevils
                    are going to town.

      She indicates the vic's legs, covered in dusty-black insects. 
      LIEUTENANT ("LOO") HENRY ENRIQUEZ, 40s, a former NY Detective
      with a prominent Brooklyn accent, hurries onto the scene. 

                                      BROOKE
                      Lieutenant --

                                      LIEUTENANT ENRIQUEZ
                    I hate the beach.

                                      BROOKE
                    The fresh air or the ocean breeze?

      Molly sees him shaking sand off his shiny leather oxfords.

                                      MOLLY
                    The sand.  Dispatcher should've called
                    for flip flops.  Huh, Loo?

      He eyes the body without a hint of emotion --

                                      LIEUTENANT ENRIQUEZ
                    Mayor's not gonna be happy.  Dead
                    brides go national.
                          (then)
                    I'll issue a short statement.  Send
                    all reporters to the PIO.

      Brooke notices something peculiar on the body. 

                                      BROOKE
                    She disappeared a week before her
                    wedding?

                                      MOLLY
                    That's right.

                                      BROOKE
                    Then why is she wearing a wedding
                    ring?

      An excellent question --

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                        9.


      CAMERA FLIES OVER the Pacific toward the roller coasters and
      surf shops of Mission Beach.  Then, HEADS further inland TO:


      Brooke behind the wheel.  Molly in the passenger seat. 

                                      BROOKE
                    What's going on with you?

                                      MOLLY
                    What?

                                      BROOKE
                    In the six years we've worked
                    together, first thing you do when
                    you get in my car is change the
                    station to anything not country. 

                                      MOLLY
                    It's fine.  I'm fine.

                                      BROOKE
                          (doesn't buy it)
                    You've been off all day.  Cal wanted
                    to talk to me in private and you
                    haven't asked why, and since when do
                    you forget an earring?  Anyone else,
                    means nothing, with you something's
                    wrong.

                                      MOLLY
                    Gavin wants a divorce.

                          (realizes)
                    And with Andrew and me, that's why
                    you didn't say anything.

                                      MOLLY
                    Marriage can be amazing and just
                    because I'm having problems is no
                    reason for you to --
                          (starts again)
                    My marriage is not a reflection of
                    marriage as an institution.

                                      BROOKE

                          (then)
                    I'm so sorry, Mol.  But at least you
                    weren't blind-sided, right?                                                                                        22.

                                      MOLLY
                    What?

                                      BROOKE
                    I mean, you've been having problems
                    since he lost his job.

                                      MOLLY
                    Marriages have problems.  And if you
                    end up with Andrew, you'll have your
                    share.  But it doesn't mean you throw
                    in the towel.

                                      BROOKE
                    Of course.

                    Our anniversary is coming up and I
                    bought him this Fender guitar, the
                    kind he sold when I got pregnant
                    with Ben.

                                      BROOKE
                    The one he never shuts up about.

                          (smiles at the memories)
                    Yeah.  It's been in the trunk of my
                    car for a month; I couldn't wait to
                    give it to him. 

                                      BROOKE
                    What are you gonna do?

                                      MOLLY
                    We'll talk tonight.  Maybe he'll
                    agree to therapy.

                                      BROOKE
                    Yeah, right.

                                      MOLLY
                    Thanks for your support.

                                      BROOKE
                    Sweetie, he doesn't like talking on
                    the phone.  He's not gonna open up
                    to a complete stranger.

                                      MOLLY
                          (nods, then)
                    So, you gonna tell me what Cal wanted?

                      I think... he wanted me.                                                                                         23.

      Molly, flanked by Brooke, knocks.  Door opens to reveal BRIAN
      HESS, early 30s, in a wife-beater and military tats, walking
      the line between menacing and totally hot.

                                      BRIAN HESS
                    What's up, Ladies?

                                      MOLLY
                    I'm Detective Collins, this is
                    Detective Kross.  We're here about
                    Chelsea Kettner...

      Brian indicates that they should come in.


      CAMERA speeds over the PACIFIC COAST, taking refuge in the
      gracefully curved HARBOR, where the setting sun reflects off                                                                                        32.

      the hundreds of sail boats, slicing through the calm water. 
      CAMERA FINDS an oceanside storefront for HORNBLOWER CRUISES --


      Blue collar neighborhood.  CAMERA PANS from a SWAT VAN to
      the DRIVEWAY, where Molly and Brooke, wearing POINT BLANK
      BODY ARMOR, meet up with FOUR SWAT OFFICERS.

                                    LEAD SWAT OFFICER
                    You get a warrant?

      On the move toward the front door --

                          ("don't need one")
                    Probable cause a felony's in progress. 
                    Victim could be inside and alive.

                                    LEAD SWAT OFFICER
                    Giddy up.

      As the LEAD SWAT OFFICER preps the door-breaching 12 GAUGE
      MASTER KEY, Molly checks the door.  To her surprise, it's
      UNLOCKED.  She exchanges a look with SWAT and quietly opens
      the door.  SWAT, followed by Molly and Brooke, stream into --


      CAMERA glides over the sparkling city.  We FLY past downtown,
      TO Balboa Park, and then TOWARD the suburbs where we FIND --


      As NIGHT turns into DAY, and the sleepy city wakes up --


      Molly, peering inside Jonas Rendell's home via INFRARED FLIR
      GOGGLES.  As she continues to seek out "heat signatures"
      (evidence of live people), SDPD fan out around the house.

      She's flanked by Brooke.  Her BLUETOOTH rings.

      Two lane canyon road -- bumpy, potholes.  CAMERA FINDS Jonas
      Rendell, driving a pick-up, hitched to his 16 foot Mono
      fishing boat.  Suddenly, SIRENS catch his attention.  He
      looks in the rear-view mirror and sees a phalanx of squad
      cars converging behind him.  Shit!  He guns it --

                    All units, approach with restraint. 
                    Potential hostage in the passenger

      The cavalcade of law enforcement is led by Brooke and Molly. 
      Blue-and-reds flash from their grille and rear-view mirror.


      We FIND Molly, in the passage seat, broadcasting orders.  As
      they begin to ascend up a HILL --                                                                                        51.

                    Air support unit is three minutes
                    out.  CHP has shut down all access
                    roads for the next ten miles.

      We PAN to Brooke, driving, on her bluetooth --

                                      BROOKE
                    ... Alright.  Makes sense.  Thanks.
                          (turns to Molly)
                    The owner of Hornblower mentioned
                    your phone call to Rendell.  Rendell
                    must've panicked and fled.

                                      MOLLY
                    He tried to stay off our radar by
                    taking the canyon road.  Nice try.

      As they get closer to Rendell --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Rendell eyes their approaching vehicle in his rear-view
      mirror.  Desperate, he reaches for his EMERGENCY TOW RELEASE. 
      CAMERA FLIES OUT HIS REAR WINDOW to the WINCH, where the
      truck DISENGAGES from the boat and begins to FREE FALL DOWN
      THE SLOPED ROAD TOWARD --


      Brooke sees the boat coming toward them.

                    Oh God!

      As the boat is about to COLLIDE with them, the STERN hits a
      pothole.  Given the boat's velocity, the IMPACT with the
      pothole UPENDS the boat, PROPELLING it into the AIR.

      Seeing the boat go airborne, Brooke SPEEDS FORWARD, driving
      underneath the boat, which SMASHES onto the road, missing
      their car by inches!  Breathless, they remain in pursuit. 

      S/FX -- The unmistakable sound of a helicopter's propeller. 

      Molly looks up to see a Bell-12 rise over the bluff.  Molly
      talks into her radio.

                    'til you're ready?

      CAMERA ANGLES up to the HELICOPTER.  And we PUSH INTO --

                                                                      INTERCUT CUT TO:                                                                                        52.


      The HELICOPTER PILOT communicates via radio.  (Note: They're
      all on the same frequency.)

                    ASU is in place.

                                      MOLLY
                    Attention all units.  Reduce speed. 
                    I repeat, reduce speed and fall back,
                    now.

      The squadron of law enforcement slows down as the helicopter
      continues to hover, just ahead of Rendell's truck.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    ASU, you're good to go.

      ANGLE ON HELICOPTER -- AS IT RELEASES SEVERAL SPIKE STRIPS
      ONTO THE ROAD, IN FRONT OF RENDELL'S PICK UP.

      STAY with Rendell as he swerves to avoid the strips, but his
      LEFT TIRES are PIERCED.  Out of control, the truck crashes
      against the guard rail, grinding to a stop.  Law enforcement
      circles the disabled pick-up and emerge from their vehicles. 

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                          (on megaphone)
                    Put your hands on your head, and
                    slowly come out of the vehicle.

      As tension mounts, the door opens and he emerges.  Brooke,
      gun drawn, throws him against the truck, and cuffs him.

                                      BROOKE
                    Jonas Rendell, you're under arrest.

      Molly approaches.  She eyes the passenger compartment, which
      is empty.  Angry and demanding --

                                      MOLLY
                    Where is she?!  Kathy Lim.  Where
                    the hell is she?

      Rendell smiles, as if taunting: "Wouldn't you like to know?" 

                                                                              FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      Molly, Brooke, the Lieutenant (all with MAG LIGHTS) and dozens
      of law enforcement personnel sweep across a forested patch
      of land high above the Pacific.  Helicopters, with flood
      lights, circle above.

                                      LIEUTENANT ENRIQUEZ
                    ... There are thirteen miles of
                    unmarked, underground bunkers -- was
                    he anymore specific?

                                      MOLLY
                      North-East quadrant.  That's all he
                    wrote.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        57.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                          (to Lieutenant)
                    Loo, we cool with how I...?

                                      LIEUTENANT ENRIQUEZ
                    Remind me to tape down the camera
                    cord so no one trips.  It's a hazard.
                          (off Molly's smile)
                    You know, the Feds spent a fortune
                    building these bunkers during World
                    War II and now won't give the city a
                    dime to secure 'em.  Last month, we
                    found an underground meth lab less
                    than a mile from here.

      Brooke's Mag light has picked up something.  She races several
      yards ahead.  Her light reveals --

                                      BROOKE
                    The underbrush has been cut. 

      With help from Molly and the Lieutenant, she quickly clears
      the disarticulated shrubbery.  Finally, they find what they're
      looking for: a latch to a door, in the dirt.  It's PADLOCKED.

                                      MOLLY
                    Stand back.

      Molly unholsters her gun.  She calls out --

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Friendly fire!

      As Molly screams out "friendly fire," the nearby officers
      repeat the line -- letting all the law enforcement know that
      it's "friendly fire" and they're not under attack. 

      Molly SHOOTS her gun and the pad lock BLOWS APART.  Molly
      pulls open the latch to reveal stairs leading down into
      darkness.  With Brooke, she descends.  Mag lights reveal a
      trove of trash -- old beer cans, cigarette butts, broken
      bottles, a shopping cart, food wrappers, etc...

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Kathy!

                                      BROOKE
                    Kathy! 

      No response and no sign of the victim.  Then, they hear a
      muffled cry and follow the sounds with their Mag Lights,
      which fall on Kathy -- bound and gagged.  They race to her. 
      Molly removes the gag.  And Brooke unties the binds.

                                      MOLLY
                    You're safe, now.  You're safe.                                                                                        58.

      Tears stream down Kathy's face.  As she falls into Molly's
      arms, Molly and Brooke share a silent moment of victory.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Molly pulls into the driveway.  As she walks toward the house,
      Gavin exits their front door.  She brightens, hoping he's
      come out to greet her --

                                      MOLLY
                    Hey.

                                      GAVIN
                    Hi.

                                      MOLLY
                    It's late...
                          (hopeful)
                    You waiting up for me?

                                      GAVIN
                          (hesitates, then)
                    Molly, I've been thinking.  What's
                    best for us, and the kids, is for
                    you to move out.

                                      MOLLY
                    What!?

                                      GAVIN
                          (angry)
                    You talked to Loo about us.

                                      MOLLY
                    So what? 

                                      GAVIN
                    You asked him to intervene.

                                      MOLLY
                    I'm trying to save our marriage.

                                      GAVIN
                    You worked him, to get to me.

                                      MOLLY
                    It's not like that.

                                      GAVIN
                    I don't have a job, right now.  I
                    can take care of the kids.  It's
                    past midnight and you're just getting
                    home.                                                                                        59.

                                      MOLLY
                    You can't do this to me, to our
                    family.  Let me in and we'll talk --

                                      GAVIN
                    I'm not doing this to hurt you.  I
                    just think it's best to make a clean
                    break.

                                      MOLLY
                          (raising her voice)
                    I won't leave our kids, you know
                    that.

                                    BEN (O.S.)
                    What's going on?

      They turn to see both Ben and Lisa, in the doorway.  As Molly
      crosses to them --

                                      MOLLY
                    Did we wake you up, Sweetie?

                                    BEN
                    Why're you yelling?

      Molly gets down to Ben's level --

                                      MOLLY
                    We're just talking.  Go back to sleep,
                    okay?

                                      GAVIN
                    Mommy has to go away for a few days.

      Molly shoots him a look.

                                    BEN
                    Who's going to make lunch?  Cuz I
                    don't like PB&J. 

                                    LISA
                    Me either.

      Molly backs away from the kids and whispers to her husband.

                                      MOLLY
                    I don't want to fight in front of
                    the kids.

                                      GAVIN
                          (defiant)
                    Then don't.

      Out of options, Molly crosses back to Ben and Lisa --                                                                                        60.

                                      MOLLY
                          (holds back tears)
                    Aunt Brooke needs me, but I'll be
                    back, real soon.  Listen to your
                    dad, okay?
                          (off their nods)
                    Who loves you more than the whole
                    world?

                                      BEN/LISA
                    You do!

                                      MOLLY
                    That's right.  Come here.

      Molly kisses her children.  Then, she sidles up to Gavin. 
      In a hushed, controlled voice --

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    I won't fight in front of them, but
                    I will fight.  And you will lose.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      TIGHT on the GUITAR, which is on the driveway in front of
      the town home.  Brooke stands near the guitar.  Molly is
      behind the wheel of her car.  She calls out of her window.

                                      MOLLY
                    You really think I should do this?

                                      BROOKE
                    Can you get your money back?

                                      MOLLY
                    No returns.

                                      BROOKE
                    Gun it!

      Molly drives full speed ahead.  She runs over the guitar
      with a SMASH!  Then, she stops the car and, with Brooke, she
      inspects the heap of splintered wood and wire.

                                      BROOKE (CONT'D)
                    Feel any better?                                                                                        62.

                                      MOLLY
                    I don't feel worse. 
                          (tries to make light)
                    Hey, one marriage ends, another
                    begins, right?  There's balance in
                    the universe.

                                      BROOKE
                          (plays along)
                    That could be Newton's Second Law...
                    The Conservation of Energy and
                      Matrimony.

      Molly smiles.  Brooke puts her arm around Molly's shoulder. 
      And as they head back toward the front door --

                                      BROOKE (CONT'D)
                    How about a drink?

                                      MOLLY
                    Just one?

                                      BROOKE
                    It's a start.

      Then, Molly turns back toward the decimated guitar.  The
      "mother" in her can't help but say --

                                      MOLLY
                    Wait.  I should really go clean that
                    up.

                                      BROOKE
                    Why?  Tomorrow, we're settin' it on
                    fire.

      Molly musters a laugh, and as they disappear inside, we SLOWLY -- 

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            THE END
