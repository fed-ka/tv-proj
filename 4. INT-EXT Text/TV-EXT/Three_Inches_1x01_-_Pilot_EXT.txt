      WALTER SPACKMAN, 26, sits on a park bench in the dark on 
      top of the Hollywood Hills during the worst storm the city 
      has seen in five years.  Thunder BOOMS.  Rain POURS.  
      Walter doesn t move.  Walter wishes he was somebody else.  
        Because this is the worst day of his life.

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:



      A modest two-bedroom house in Studio City.  Birds chirp, 
      the sun shines.  A SUPER reads: That Morning.

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter s old bedroom is a time machine.  Comic books, a 
      Sony PlayStation, a faded World of Warcraft poster.  An 
      old Bondi Blue iMac with a Buffy the Vampire Slayer 
        screensaver.  Walter doesn t live here anymore.  He s just 
        passing through.  The cardboard boxes stacked against a 
      wall contain his belongings.  Walter lies in his high 
      school bed, peers at the ceiling.

                                        WALTER
                    Ten, nine, eight...

      It s a countdown.  Walter is ready to launch.

      IN A HALLWAY

        BELINDA SPACKMAN, 50, walks down a hallway with an unlit 
        cigarette in her mouth.  Belinda is profane, brutally 
        honest, and borderline bi-polar.

                                        BELINDA
                    Rise and shine, my little boomerang!  Up 
                    and at  em!  He who hesitates is lunch! 

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter continues the countdown:

                                        WALTER
                      Four, three, two...

      IN A HALLWAY 

        Belinda reaches Walter s door.                                                                                      2.



                                        BELINDA
                    All work and no play makes Jack my first 
                      husband!  If at first you don t succeed, 
                      you re a Spackman!

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter sits up.  Liftoff.

                                        WALTER
                      Lily.

        Belinda enters, and without missing a beat: 

                                        BELINDA
                      Don t do it.  It s a death trap, it s a 
                      suicide run.

                                        WALTER
                      Lily s back visiting her Dad.  I can tell 
                    by the way the air shimmers.  And she 
                      texted me.

                                        BELINDA
                    You don t listen to a word I say.

                                        WALTER
                      I appreciate your advice and I know you 
                    care about me.

      Walter hops out of bed.  Belinda blocks the doorway.

                                        BELINDA
                       Care  is insufficient to describe my 
                      willingness to murder anyone who hurts 
                    you.

                                        WALTER
                      You re not going to change my mind.

                                        BELINDA
                      Walter.  You may be too old for me to 
                    lock in the basement.  But you are too 
                      young to learn that dreams are just lies 
                    we tell ourselves when we re asleep.

      Walter believes he is different from everybody else.  He 
      can feel it deep inside.  Now all he needs is actual 
      proof.  Which some might call hope.

                                        WALTER
                      I should ve told her when we were ten and 
                    she hated her braces.  I should ve told 
                    her when we were twelve and she placed 
                      third in the Scripps National Spelling 
                    bee --                                                                                      3.



                                        BELINDA
                      I could spell  laodicean  standing on my 
                      head.

                                        WALTER
                      I should ve told her when we were sixteen 
                    and she blew out her knee at Kitzbuhel.  
                      I should ve told her when we were twenty 
                    and she modeled in Paris.

                                        BELINDA
                      Funny thing.  You never mention what you 
                    were doing at the time.

                                        WALTER
                      Today, I m finally going to tell Lily 
                      Theroux how I feel.  I m going to put the 
                      right words in the right order like a 
                      magic spell.  And when I do?  Everything 
                    will be different than it was before.  
                    I ll be different, too.

      Walter steps to the hallway.  Belinda calls after him.

                                        BELINDA
                      Hearts don t break like legs break.  The 
                      pieces never really mend.  Brush your 
                      teeth!!



      Walter wheels his bike out the front door.  Walter stops 
      to stare at the house next-door.  DOUG THEROUX, mid-50s, 
      steps to his porch to get the morning paper. 

                                        THEROUX
                      Walter.  Back home, I see.

                                        WALTER
                      Temporary downsizing.  Until I find a 
                      place I can afford.

                                        THEROUX
                      Lily s asleep.  Jet lag.

                                        WALTER
                    Did you know Melatonin reduces jet lag 
                    and speeds up the rate at which your body 
                      adjusts to new time zones?

                                        THEROUX
                      I did not know that.  

                                        WALTER
                    Tell Lily she s in my thoughts.  Big day 
                      today.                                                                                      4.



      Doug knows how Walter feels about Lily. 

                                        THEROUX
                    Sure thing, Walter.  Big day.



      The Im-Paws-ible Dream Pet Salon is a tiny pet groooming 
      business hidden in a sunbaked mini-mall.  Keeping Your 
      Pets Happy Since 2003!

      IN THE SALON

        A cramped interior.  Walter works at a big metal tub in 
      the back.  He wears rubber gloves and an apron.  He washes 
      a toy poodle and rehearses:  

                                        WALTER
                       Lily.  I know this will come as a 
                      surprise --  
                                (beat)
                       Lily.  It took me a long time to 
                      understand --  

      AKIO NOMO is in his late 60s.  He trims each pet with care 
      and precision.  Nomo listens to Walter rehearse.

                                        WALTER
                       Lily.  I know this will come as a 
                      surprise --    

                                        NOMO
                      Walter?

                                        WALTER
                    Yes, Mister Nomo?

                                        NOMO
                      There is no way this will come as a 
                      surprise to anyone.  Lily included.

        Everybody knows how Walter feels about Lily.

                                        NOMO
                    Try the other way.

                                        WALTER
                     It took me a long time -- ? 

                                        NOMO
                    That one, yes.

                                        WALTER
                       Lily.  It took me a long time to 
                      understand that my life had a purpose. 

      Nomo nods approval.  Then, quiet and sure:                                                                                      5.



                                        NOMO
                        Congratulations.  Today is your happy 
                      ending.  



      Walter exits.  MACKLIN SPORTELLO, 26, leans against a beat-
      up Buick Skylark convertible.  Macklin is a sweet-tempered 
      bullshit artist.  Someday he s going to be a famous chef 
      and have his own reality TV show.  Just ask him.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Dude.

                                        WALTER
                      Macklin.

      IN THE SKYLARK

        Macklin drives, Walter sits beside him.  Walter looks at 
      an apartment ad circled in The Recycler.

                                        WALTER
                       Bedroom and practice room.   What s a 
                      practice room?

                                        MACKLIN
                      I think that s like a room that s too big 
                    to call a closet but too small to call a 
                      bedroom.

                                        WALTER
                      Lucky for me I don t own anything bigger 
                    than a toaster.

                                        MACKLIN
                    Joey Yaros, the guy who repeat-fainted in 
                      Mister Danforth s bio class?  His sister 
                      lives there.  The landlord s decent, and 
                      everything works.  We can see it tomorrow 
                    if you want.  I got the day off at the 
                      restaurant.

                                        WALTER
                    You still on prep? 

      This is a sore subject.  Macklin scowls.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Screw up one cold app and they think you 
                      don t know the difference between a fork 
                    and a spoon.  I m a line cook, man.  
                      Chopping lettuce is beneath me.

      They pull up to Walter s house.  Walter looks at Lily s 
      house next door.  Macklin follows his gaze.                                                                                      6.



                                        MACKLIN
                      Formosa tonight.  Everybody s goin .  
                      Katie Burns asked if you d be there.

                                        WALTER
                      Can t.  I got plans.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Lily s back in town.

                                        WALTER
                    How can you tell?

        Macklin just shakes his head.  Everybody knows.

                                        MACKLIN
                    See you tomorrow, Walter.



      START CLOSE on LILY THEROUX, 26.  Lily is beautiful to a 
        breathtaking degree.  Lily was a Junior Olympics downhill 
        champion.  Lily read every book David Foster Wallace 
      wrote.  Lily sits in the back yard of her father s house 
      in a lotus position, eyes closed, and meditates.  Doug 
        Theroux ushers Walter into view.  Walter just looks at 
      Lily for a beat.  He whispers her name like a prayer.

                                        WALTER
                      Lily.

      Lily smiles first, opens her eyes.  Her eyes are sky blue.   

                                        LILY
                      Walter.

      Lily gets to her feet with consummate grace.  She s even 
      taller than you expect.  Lily bounds across the grass to 
      the porch.  Walter watches every step she takes.                                                                                       7.




      Walter drives his mother s old Toyota up Laurel Canyon 
        Boulevard.  Lily sits beside him.

                                        LILY
                      I can t believe your Mom still has this 
                    old car.

                                        WALTER
                    The engine runs on anger and wishful 
                      thinking.  Good gas mileage, too.

                                        LILY
                      Remember my Dad used to take me on father-
                      daughter road trips?  We went to El 
                      Capitan where they have those tents with 
                      floors.  Dad made a fire, and we roasted 
                      marshmallows, and pretended Mom wasn t 
                      dating the stunt coordinator on Walker, 
                      Texas Ranger.

                                        WALTER
                    Then he threw all her shoes on the lawn 
                    and listened to Phantom of the Opera for 
                      three months.

      Walter and Lily grin at the memory.     

                                        LILY
                    You look good.  

                                        WALTER
                      Thanks.  So do you.  

                                        LILY
                      Still washing dogs?

                                        WALTER
                    Nine to five. 

                                        LILY
                    So.  Record store clerk, video store 
                      clerk, book store clerk --

                                        WALTER
                    The digital revolution killed my clerk 
                      work.

                                        LILY
                      Process server.

                                        WALTER
                      I lasted one day.

                                        LILY
                      Secret shopper.                                                                                      8.



                                        WALTER
                    The trick to secret shopping is a sense 
                    of wonder.

                                        LILY
                    I m just saying --

                                        WALTER
                    -- What you always say.

                                        LILY
                    You can do better if you want.  Not that 
                      there s anything wrong with pet grooming.

        There s affection, not judgement, in this.  No matter.  
      Walter is confident in all things.  Extremely so.

                                        WALTER
                    It s all part of my ten-year plan.
                      Looking for a way to live in the world 
                    that makes sense takes time.  But that 
                      doesn t mean I won t find it.  Besides.  
                      Everything s about to change.

                                        LILY
                    It is?  Walter.  That s great.  How?

      Walter reaches the top of the canyon, and turns to her.

                                        WALTER
                      I have a special surprise for you.

        Distant thunder BOOMS, punctuates.



      The Hollywood Hills.  Walter and Lily move down 
        undeveloped terrain.   

                                        WALTER
                    Just a little bit farther.

      The sky fills with dark clouds.  Then a surprise.  There s 
      a park bench carefully positioned on the side of the hill.  
      The bench faces the city.  

                                        LILY
                    How did that happen?  

                                        WALTER
                    Me. 

      TIME CUT - ON THE BENCH

      Lily and Walter sit.  They look at the city and the sky.                                                                                        9.



                                        LILY
                      Thank you for my special surprise.

                                        WALTER
                      That s not the surprise.

                                        LILY
                    It s not?

      Walter turns to Lily.  This is his moment. 

                                        WALTER
                      Lily.  It took me a long time to 
                      understand that my life had a purpose.

                                        LILY
                    Is this part of the ten-year plan?

                                        WALTER
                    If it s okay with you it d probably be 
                      better if there were no more 
                        interruptions.  This is the kind of thing 
                      I need to get out in one piece.

                                        LILY
                    Oh.  Okay.  Sorry.  Go ahead.

                                        WALTER
                      Lily.  It took me a long time to 
                      understand that my life had a purpose.  
                    But once I did, I realized it was always 
                      there, waiting for me to see it, and to 
                      recognize its value.  I believe --

      A single raindrop interrupts, SPATTERS on Walter s 
        forehead.  Walter wipes the water away, resumes:

                                        WALTER
                      I believe my purpose in life is to make 
                    you happy.  I think it s something that I 
                      would be really good at.  Not because I 
                      studied for it or because there s a 
                      written manual.  I will be good at it 
                      because that s why my heart was made.
                                (beat)
                      I loved you the first day you moved in 
                    next door.  I loved you during the two 
                    week period in 1995 when you weren t 
                      beautiful.  I loved you in high school 
                    when you dated Rex Hainsworth and we 
                      didn t talk like we used to.  I loved you 
                    when you went away.  I love you now even 
                    more than all those other times.  It s 
                    the best thing I do.

      Lily s eyes fill with tears.                                                                                    10.



                                        WALTER
                      I never told you this because I was 
                      afraid of what you d think.  But if I 
                      never told you, how would you know?  I m 
                    not afraid anymore.  It s important to me 
                    that you know.  Now you do.  The End.

        A tense beat.  Walter waits for Lily to reply.  Then:

                                        LILY
                    Oh, Walter.  Walter.  That s the most 
                      beautiful thing anyone ever said to me.

                                        WALTER
                      I practiced in my spare time.

      Lily hugs Walter.  Every cell in Walter s body sings.  

                                        LILY
                    But --

                                        WALTER
                    But?

      But.  Lily pulls back from Walter.

                                        LILY
                    When I m away on a job, or in another 
                      country, or maybe something that feels 
                    like this grand adventure?  You re the 
                      first person I want to tell about it.  
                      Because you re my best friend.   

        Another raindrop spatters on Walter.  This time he doesn t 
      wipe it away.

                                        LILY
                    What you said, I know how hard that was, 
                    how brave, and how important it is, too.  
                    But Walter.  I don t feel the same way 
                    you do.  I wish I did.  But I don t.  I m 
                    so sorry.

      Lily hugs him again.  It feels different than the first.

                                        LILY
                    Are you okay?

                                        WALTER
                      Fine, thanks.

                                        LILY
                    Will it help if I pretend this never 
                      happened?

                                        WALTER
                    You can remember if you want.  I m pretty 
                    sure I will.                                                                                    11.



                                        LILY
                      Maybe -- maybe this is the kind of thing 
                    that will make our friendship stronger.  
                    More durable.

                                        WALTER
                    Spun polyester is very durable.  The open 
                      weave reduces fabric stress.

      Lily seeks a silver lining.  Walter considers opening a 
      vein.  That s when rain POURS DOWN from the sky.  Lily 
      hops to her feet.  

                                        LILY
                      Walter?

                                        WALTER
                    I m just going to sit here for a while if 
                    you don t mind.

                                        LILY
                      That s probably not a good idea --

                                        WALTER
                    Go away.  Please.

      The harsh note in his voice takes Lily by surprise.  
      Walter holds out the car keys to her.  A beat.  Lily takes 
      the keys, and hurries up the hill.  She stops, takes one 
      last look at him.

      ON THE BENCH

      Walter sits in the rain and realizes this is the day he 
      learns he will never be special.  

      TIME CUT - NIGHT

      We return to where we STARTED.  Walter sits on the old 
      park bench in the dark on top of the Hollywood Hills 
      during the worst storm the city has seen in five years.   
        Thunder BOOMS.  Rain POURS.  Walter doesn t move.  Walter 
      wishes he was somebody else.  Because this is the worst 
      day of his young life.  

      That s when lightning STRIKES a tree less than two hundred 
      feet away from him.  The tree topples, halved.  Walter 
      reacts with absolute astonishment.  Then he smiles.

                                        WALTER
                    That is so cool --

      Then a second lightning bolt STRIKES Walter right where he 
      sits and the SCREEN goes BRIGHT WHITE and --

                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    12.



                                          ACT TWO


        SUDDENLY1010

      Walter lies on the ground, his clothing shredded and 
        burned.  A JOGGER kneels over him and performs CPR.  We 
      HEAR Walter s VOICE OVER.  Calm, curious.  As if he were 
      watching from a peaceful remove.

                                        WALTER S VOICE
                    On average, lightning strikes the earth 
                      about 100 times every second.  But your 
                      chances of getting hit by lightning while 
                      sitting on a park bench with a broken 
                      heart?  One in 280,000.

      An ambulance speeds down Los Angeles streets.  An EMT 
      works on Walter.  

                                        WALTER S VOICE
                    The voltage of a typical industrial 
                      electrical shock is 20 to 60 kilovolts.  
                      A lightning strike delivers 300.  The 
                      temperature of a lightning strike is 
                      about 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

      ER DOCTORS hurry Walter down a hospital corridor.  

                                        WALTER S VOICE
                    Roy Sullivan holds the record for getting 
                    hit by lighting the most times.  He was 
                    park ranger and he survived seven 
                      strikes.  He lost his big toe.

      Walter lies on an ER bed.  His clothing is cut from his 
      body.  Doctors and nurses work feverishly.  

                                        WALTER S VOICE
                    When the bolt hit, I felt like I was 
                      beaten with a hundred sledge hammers.  It 
                    was like every case of the flu I ever had 
                    at the same time.  Every single part of 
                    my body hurt.  My hair hurt.  My eye 
                      lashes hurt.  My fingernails, too.

      CAMERA RISES UP, LOOKS DOWN at Walter from a high angle.

                                        WALTER S VOICE
                      Today was the day I proved I was special.  
                    This is not exactly what I had in mind.  
                    Or as my Mom would say?  When God closes 
                      a door, she slams it on your fingers.

      The SCREEN goes BLACK.  We HEAR one last line.                                                                                    13.



                                        WALTER S VOICE
                    My head filled with the sound of a 
                      thousand church bells ringing.

      And now we HEAR them RING.


      BLACK SCREEN1111

      The SCREEN is BLACK.  Then we SEE white ceiling tiles, 
        flourescent light.  This is Walter s hospital room.  If he 
      was conscious it would be his POV.  But he s not.

                                        BELINDA S VOICE
                      Walter?

        Belinda Spackman s face moves INTO VIEW.  She looks down 
      at her son with hope and sorrow.

                                        BELINDA
                      First?  I had a very funny gag prepared 
                      about Lily and lightning but it doesn t 
                    feel as funny with you lying there all 
                      scrambled.  Second?  The doctor, whom I 
                      loathe, says you should snap out of it 
                    any time now, there s no particular 
                      reason for you not to, so please give me 
                      a goddam break and snap --

      The screen goes BLACK.  But more faces return to view, 
      linked by BLACKOUTS.

      - Lily Theroux holds Walter s hand.

                                        LILY
                      Walter?  Can you hear me?  I just want 
                    you to know, no matter what, that I m 
                      still --

      - Mr. Nomo holds a flower and recites a prayer in Korean. 
      He places the flower on Walter s chest.

      - A sudden silence.  TROY HAMILTON is 40 years old.  He 
      wears an expensive suit.  Troy looks at Walter like he s 
        looking for clues.  We haven t met Troy before.  But we 
      will meet him again.

        - Macklin Sportello pretends he s not terrified but he is. 
      Which explains the babbling.  

                                        MACKLIN
                    Hi, it s me.  Macklin Sportello.  In case 
                    you don t remember I m probably your best 
                      friend.  Did you know there was this guy 
                    in a coma but it turned out he was only 
                      paralyzed so he was trapped in his own 
                    body for thirty years?  Anyway.  We don t 
                    have to talk about that now --                                                                                    14.



        - Belinda returns to view, and we ve come full circle.  
      Her voice is thick with emotion.

                                        BELINDA
                    And third?  I love you like crazy I do.



      The hospital exterior.  It s a sunny day.

      IN WALTER S HOSPITAL ROOM

      Time passes.  Walter recovers.  He s in the same hospital 
      bed.  The RINGING continues at an even lower level.  
      Walter is bored and restless and alone.  

        There s a glass of water on a stand next to the bed.  
      Walter reaches for the glass, but it is out of reach.  
      Walter frowns, reaches for it a second time.  But the 
      glass is still beyond his grasp.  Walter exhales an 
        irritable sigh.  He keeps his arm extended.  And then 
        something impossible happens.  The glass MOVES three 
      inches toward his fingertips.  As if to respond to his 
      mind s wish.  Walter FREEZES.  He looks around the room 
      for witnesses or a reason.  He checks under the stand.  A 
      beat.  Walter looks back to the glass.  

        Belinda Spackman BARGES into the hospital room without 
      warning.  Walter SCREAMS at the top of his lungs.  Belinda 
      pretends that he didn t.

                                        BELINDA
                      You re looking chipper.

        Macklin follows Belinda into the room.  He pushes a 
        wheelchair.  Belinda indicates the chair.

                                        BELINDA
                    Time to go.  I completed the relevant 
                      paperwork, strangled two doctors and --

                                        WALTER
                      I think I may be having hallucinations.

                                        BELINDA
                    Of course you are, dear.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Maybe it s a side effect of getting your 
                      brain boiled.

      That s when Walter realizes there s something he missed.

                                        WALTER
                    The ringing.  It s gone.

      And it STOPPED the moment he moved that glass.  Or 
        hallucinated that he did.  Or not. 



        Another sunny day in Studio City.                                                                                    16.



      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter gets out of bed with unusual caution.  There s a 
        slipper on the floor.  Walter looks at the slipper, and it 
      MOVES three inches closer.  Walter lets out YELP, and 
      dives back into bed.  He looks around the room.  Every 
        object, large and small, represents a threat.  If only 
        because Walter is afraid he ll move it with his mind.

      TIME CUT - IN THE KITCHEN

      Walter eats breakfast with his mother.  Walter eyes his 
      bowl of cereal.  Naturally, the bowl MOVES three inches in 
      his direction.  Walter grabs it with both hands, if only 
      to stop his mother from noticing. 

                                        BELINDA
                    -- And you can stay here for as long as 
                    you like.  Apartment-hunting can wait.  I 
                    will tend to your every need.

      Walter looks to a glass of orange juice.  He reaches for 
      it slowly so as not to disrupt the space/time continuum.  
      Walter takes hold of the glass.  It did not move an inch.  
      Walter reacts with relief.  

                                        BELINDA
                    Is there something wrong with the orange 
                      juice?  I squeezed it myself.

                                        WALTER
                    No, it s fine.  Very fresh.

      Walter s spoon starts to bounce and shake.  Walter slams a 
      hand on top of it.  And changes the subject:

                                        WALTER
                    So.  Mom.  What happened to your fake 
                      cigarette?

                                        BELINDA
                      I quit fake smoking.  It s fake bad for 
                    you.

      The doorbell RINGS.  Now what?

                                        WALTER
                    Is that my head or is that the door?



      Late at night.  A bright moon soars overhead.

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter gets out of bed, steps to his window.  He opens the 
        blinds.  Lily s bedroom is directly opposite.  The bedroom                                                                                     18.



      curtains are drawn.  Light shines inside.  Walter can HEAR 
      the sound of MUFFLED conversation.  Lily s talking on the 
        telephone.  Walter extends his arm to her window.  Walter 
        focuses and the focus is reflected in his face.  He 
      gestures for the curtains to part.  And they do.  Three 
        inches.  But not an inch more.  Walter s not freaked out 
      this time.  He s not surprised, either.  Walter smiles.



      Morning.  Lily Theroux sunbathes in the back yard.  
        There s a mango tree, and mangos rotting in the grass.  
      Lily reads a magazine.  Walter steps into view.  

                                        LILY
                      Walter.

                                        WALTER
                      There s something I need to tell you.

                                        LILY
                    You were pretty comprehensive the last 
                      time.

                                        WALTER
                    Not that.  Lily.  Something amazing is 
                      happening to me.

        A familiar SOUND is HEARD.  It s a motorcycle.  Django 
      rolls into the back yard.

                                        LILY
                      Django!

      Django poses on the motorcycle.

                                        LILY
                      Walter, this is my friend, Django.  We 
                    met on a job in Tahiti.

                                        DJANGO
                      What s up, Lloyd?

                                        WALTER
                    My name is Walter.

                                        DJANGO
                    You look more like a  Lloyd  to me.

                                        LILY
                      Django restored that Vincent Black Shadow 
                    with his Dad, and converted it to run on 
                      hydrogen fuel cells.  

      Walter retreats from this latest humiliation.  At least 
      until he steps on something squishy.  It s a rotten mango.                                                                                      19.



                                        WALTER
                    What year is it?

                                        DJANGO
                     52.  Best Vincent ever. 

      Walter extends an arm as if to stretch, and aims his new 
      mojo at the mango tree over Django s head.  But nothing 
      happens.  Lily s cell phone rings, and she answers it.

                                        WALTER
                    Mind if I take to look?

      Walter steps to Django, the motorcycle, and the mango 
      tree.  Walter fake stretches, focuses.  At a closer 
        distance.  A beat.  This time, a ripe mango separates from 
      its stem, and FALLS to the ground at Django s feet.

                                        DJANGO
                      Whoa.

      Walter faces the mango tree.  A second mango DROPS near 
      the first.  The third mango HITS Django on the shoulder.

                                        DJANGO
                      Whoa.

      Walter looks to Django s sunglasses.  This requires 
        greater effort.  As if his power was beginning to wane.  
      Walter POPS out a lens.  Django reacts with astonishment.  
      Walter TURNS ON a portable sprinkler and water SHOOTS UP 
      all around him.  Django reacts with greater astonishment.  
        Because he knows, impossible or not, that Walter did this.  

      Walter reacts with triumph.  At least until he sees the 
      look in Django s eye.  He s afraid.  Lily sees it, too.

                                        LILY
                      Django -- how did the -- ?

      Walter tries to turn off the portable sprinkler.  But his 
      power, however temporarily, is gone.  Lily hurries to the 
        faucet.  Django whispers:

                                        DJANGO
                      Freak. 

                                        LILY
                      I think it s broken.  Walter, what 
                      happened -- ?

      Walter runs away.  The word follows him home.  Freak.



      The Hollywood Restaurant is a hip hangout in Hollywood.  

      INSIDE THE RESTAURANT

        Post-modern club decor.  Tables, booths.  An open kitchen 
      and a long bar.  Walter sits at the bar over a bottle of 
      beer.  Macklin steps into view.  He wears kitchen whites.

                                        MACKLIN
                      What s up?

                                        WALTER
                    The first of many beers.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Nuking your sorrows with alcohol.  Good 
                      plan.

                                        WALTER
                    Do you think alcohol will help me forget 
                      Lily?

                                        MACKLIN
                      I don t think it s possible to drink that 
                      much.

        Macklin returns to the kitchen.  Walter looks to a bowl of 
      peanuts.  The bowl MOVES three inches to his hand.  A 
      beat.  Then a surprise:

                                        TROY S VOICE
                      Hello, Walter.

        A stranger sits two stools away.  It s Troy Hamilton, last 
      seen at Walter s hospital bed.  

                                        WALTER
                    Hey.

      Wait a minute.

                                        WALTER
                    Have we met?

                                        TROY
                    No.

                                        WALTER
                    But you know my name.

                                        TROY
                      I know everything about you.

                                        WALTER
                    Why?                                                                                    21.



                                        TROY
                    It s my job.

      Troy sits beside Walter.  He s an affable man.  Quick to 
      smile, a twinkle in his eyes.  But there s iron behind the 
      friendly exterior.  

                                        WALTER
                      Well, whatever they re paying you?  It s 
                    too much.

                                        TROY
                    Why do you say that?

                                        WALTER
                    I m a twenty-six year-old dog washer 
                      currently living with his mother.  What s 
                    to know?

                                        TROY
                      Don t be so hard on yourself.  Everybody 
                    has a secret gift inside.  A difference.  
                    You just happen to be a little more in 
                      touch with yours than most.  The trick is 
                    to make the very best of it that you can. 

                                        WALTER
                    My Mom buys audio books that sound just 
                    like you.  

                                        TROY
                    I m curious.  Have you tested the limits 
                    of your ability?  It s important to 
                      understand what you can and can t do.

      Walter reacts.  Troy knows.  

                                        WALTER
                    Who are you?

                                        TROY
                    Troy Hamilton.

      Walter s not sure what to do next.  Because this 
        conversation feels impossible.  

                                        WALTER
                    So.  Troy Hamilton.  What can I do for 
                    you?

                                        TROY
                      Ideally?  You can help me fight evil and 
                    make the world a better place.

                                        WALTER
                      Seriously.  Why are you here?                                                                                    22.



                                        TROY
                      I find people with special talents.  We 
                      track lightning strike victims.  That s 
                    how I found you.

                                        WALTER
                    Are you part of a super secret government 
                      organization that turns out to be as bad 
                    as the bad guys in the end?

                                        TROY
                    I m a private contractor with good 
                      intentions and clear conscience.  Wasabi 
                      peanut?

      Troy indicates the bowl of peanuts that Walter pushed.  A 
      beat.  Walter quietly confesses:

                                        WALTER
                      Look.  Whatever I move, I can only move 
                    it three inches.  It s the worst 
                      superpower ever.  Like having an extra 
                      thumb.

                                        TROY
                    You need to expand your line of thinking.

                                        WALTER
                    Bar bets?  The circus?

                                        TROY
                    You have no idea what you can do.  Not 
                    yet.  

                                        WALTER
                      Invisibility.  Now there s a superpower.

                                        TROY
                      Doesn t exist.  I looked.

      Walter reacts.  Walter looks back to his beer.  Troy leans 
      a little closer to him.

                                        TROY
                      Walter.  I know exactly how you feel.  
                    You feel lost and alone.  You feel like 
                      nobody could ever understand.  You feel 
                    like a freak.  But that s not who you 
                    are.

      Walter turns to Troy.  Troy meets his gaze.

                                        WALTER
                      Okay.  Who am I?

                                                                                      23.



                                        TROY
                      You re a young man with a special talent.  
                      A talent that can make you a hero.

                                        WALTER
                    I m not hero material.  Ask anyone.

      Walter gets up, and walks away.



      Walter steps from the restaurant to the night.  He thinks 
      about everything the stranger said.  Walter feels like 
      he s dreaming and can t wake up.



      Morning.  The modest two-bedroom house in Studio City.  

      IN A HALLWAY & BEDROOM

        Belinda walks down the hallway, and calls out as she goes:

                                        BELINDA
                    Rise and shine, my little lightning rod!  
                    All work and no play makes Walter --

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

                                        BELINDA
                    -- A minimum wage employee!

        Belinda continues inside.  Walter s bed is empty.



      Walter waits at an intersection one block away.  A sedan 
      with tinted windows rolls to the curb.  A beat.  The 
      driver s side window ROLLS down, reveals Troy Hamilton.

                                        TROY
                      Morning, Walter.  Ready?

      Walter doesn t answer.  But he nods assent.



      Troy drives through an anonymous suburban neighborhood.  
      Walter sits beside him.  He is full of doubts.  But he s 
      eager too.

                                        WALTER
                    Why lightning strike victims?

                                        TROY
                    We check for enhanced perception, 
                      paranormal skills.

                                        WALTER
                    How many did you find?

                                        TROY
                      There s an octogenarian in New Canaan who 
                    can lick postage stamps with her mind.  A 
                      teenager in Moline who can accurately 
                      predict the duration of commercial 
                      breaks.  Most people just blow out their 
                    ear drums.



      Troy and Walter step toward a drab 1950s ranch house.

                                        TROY
                    It s not exactly the Fortress of 
                      Solitude.  We like to keep a low profile.

      IN THE LIVING ROOM

      Troy ushers Walter into house and living room.  Exactly 
      like Time Zone saw it.  Troy speaks TO CAMERA again.

                                        TROY
                      Everybody?  This is Walter Spackman.  I 
                      invited Walter to join us.  But Walter 
                    has his doubts.                                                                                    26.



      MYNAH BIRD, 45, steps to greet them.  She looks like a 
      suburban housewife.  From Seoul, Korea.  Her expression is 
      blank.  Mynah Bird s expression is always blank.  

                                        TROY
                    This is Mynah Bird.  She can duplicate 
                    and broadcast almost any sound.

      Mynah holds out hand to shake.  THE BUGMASTER follows.  
      He s an albino man of 35.

                                        TROY
                    The Bugmaster is able to commune with 
                      members of the insect kingdom.

        A cockroach skitters from the Bugmaster s hair down the 
      collar of his shirt.  

                                        TROY
                    Time Zone can see into the future.  
                      Approximately five minutes.

      Time Zone s face retains the headache wince.

                                        TROY
                    The Human Smell?  Well.  You can probably 
                      guess.

      The Human Smell muttered throughout the introductions.  
      Now we HEAR what he s muttering.  It s a kind of superhero 
      VOICE OVER, a narration for this boy s life.

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    -- As they came face to face, the first 
                      thing Walter noticed was the Smell s 
                      steely gaze, eyes that penetrate --

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Save it, Stinky.

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Sorry.  Hey.  Dude.

      Walter shakes his hand.  Troy indicates Mood Swing.

                                        TROY
                    And Mood Swing.  Able to alter and shape 
                      emotional states faster and more 
                      effectively than any drug known to man.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    It s not exactly leaping tall buildings 
                    in a single bound.  But I get by.  What s 
                    your secret, Walter?

      Walter looks at Mood Swing and forgets his own name.                                                                                    27.



                                        WALTER
                      I can -- I can -- I --

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Probably not public speaking.

                                        TROY
                      Walter can move any object three inches.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    That sounds about right.  Welcome.  I 
                      think you re going to like it here. 

      Mood Swing holds out a hand.  Walter takes hold.  Walter s 
      doubts decrease by a factor of ten.



      A new day.  The two-bedroom in Studio City.  

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter s room and bed are empty.  The door suddenly swings 
      OPEN.  Belinda s on the other side.  As if she was trying 
      to catch Walter before he left.  But she didn t.



      Walter waits for Troy Hamilton to pick him up.  A familiar 
      car rolls into view.  But it s not Troy.  It s Macklin 
        Sportello in the convertible Skylark.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Where have you been?  I left like twenty 
                      messages.

                                        WALTER
                      Sorry.  I was busy with this unexpected 
                      thing that I had scheduled --

                                        MACKLIN
                      I got a hot tip on another apartment, 
                    this one s in Echo Park?  One and a half 
                      bedrooms, I don t even know what that 
                      means, one and a half, but we got to move 
                    fast if we --

      Walter glances into the near distance.  The familiar sedan 
      pulls to the curb.  Troy Hamilton is inside.

                                        WALTER
                      I don t have time to look at apartments 
                      right now.                                                                                    31.



                                        MACKLIN
                    You always have time.

                                        WALTER
                    Not anymore.  Sorry, Macklin.  I m late.

      Walter backs away from the Skylark.  Macklin sees the 
      sedan waiting for him.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Who s that?

                                        WALTER
                      Don t follow me.

                                        MACKLIN
                    I m not stalking you, Walter!  I m trying 
                    to be your friend!

      Walter gets into the sedan.  The sedan rolls off.  Macklin 
      shouts after it anyway.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Lightning changed you, man!!  And not in 
                      a good way!!



      Walter leads the team through the dark.  CAMERA REVEALS 
      their destination.  It s The Hollywood Restaurant.  The 
      hip hangout where Macklin works.



        Patrons exit from the bar to the night.  It s late.

      INSIDE THE BAR

      Mood Swing studies Walter for a beat.  Then:

                                        MOOD SWING
                    You need a catch phrase. 

                                        WALTER
                      I do?

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Everybody has one.

                                        WALTER
                    They do?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    No.  But you need a costume.

                                        WALTER
                      I do?

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Everybody has one.

                                        WALTER
                    They do?                                                                                    36.



                                        MOOD SWING
                    No.  But you need a superhero identity.

      Walter does not speak.  If only to avoid getting fooled 
      again.  Mood Swing deadpans:

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Actually you do need a superhero 
                      identity.   Walter  won t cut it in this 
                    line of work.

      Walter grins.  The Human Smell was right.  With each 
        passing moment, this feels more like a family to him.

      JUMP CUT - IN THE BOOTH

      Walter pours himself another beer.

                                        WALTER
                    When did you realize you could make 
                      people happy or sad?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    The day after I hit puberty.

                                        WALTER
                      What s your real name?  What did they 
                    call you when you were born?  If you were 
                      running across a summer lawn and your 
                      mother shouted your name because it was 
                    time for dinner, what name would she -- ?

      Walter s shitfaced.  A VOICE interrupts:

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL S VOICE
                      That s a secret nobody knows.  

      Walter turns to the sound.  Captain Normal stands over 
      him.  He s the young man who watched Walter train.  He is 
        handsome, cocksure, and strong.  

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    Step out, Newbie.

      Walter obeys without thinking.  Captain Normal sits in his 
      place next to Mood Swing.

                                        WALTER
                    Who are you?

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    I m the guy that makes sure you freaks 
                      don t screw up.  I m the team leader, and 
                      liasion to Mister Hamilton.  When I give 
                    an order?  You obey.  Sit.                                                                                    37.



        Freaks.  There s that word again.  Walter sits in spite of 
      himself.  The Human Smell quietly narrates his 
        humiliation:

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    The night tasted of defeat and broken 
                      dreams.  Captain Normal smirked, his 
                      arrogance exceeded only by his one true 
                      ability -- the ability to act like a 
                      total douche bag --  

        Captain Normal shoots a look at the Human Smell.

                                        WALTER
                      What s your special power?

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Captain Normal doesn t have one.

                                        MYNAH BIRD
                      Hence the name.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    My special ability is I can kick your ass 
                    with one hand tied behind my back.

        Captain Normal puts an arm around Mood Swing.  Mood Swing 
      shrugs it off.  But Walter SEES the way Captain Normal 
      looks at her.  Walter s heart sinks just a little.



      Walter and Mood Swing linger outside.  The Bugmaster moves 
      off into the shadows with Myna Bird and Time Zone.  Three 
      moths sit lightly on his shoulder.                                                                                    39.



                                        MOOD SWING
                      C mon, Walter.  Better if we re not 
                      around.

                                        WALTER
                      I want to be clear and just for the 
                      record?  Washing dogs is not who I am 
                    it s what I did.  And Lily?  Big deal if 
                    I m two years away from adding five more 
                    to my ten-year plan.  Is that so wrong?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    You really like beer.

                                        WALTER
                    Me, too.

      Walter wobbles.  Then, with quiet affection:

                                        MOOD SWING
                      I think we ll call you Three Inches.

                                        WALTER
                      Three Inches.  I like that.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Now all you need is a catch phrase.

                                        WALTER
                      Wait.  I got one.  Up, up, and --

        SCREAMS of HORROR are HEARD.  PATRONS stream out to the 
        sidewalk.  Some rub desperately at their eyes.  Some 
      COUGH.  Most VOMIT where they stand.  A beat.  The Human 
      Smell steps into view.  

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      That s how I do.

      Walter grins.  Mood Swing grins, too.  The Human Smell 
      joins them, and they RUN into the night.  Walter shouts, 
      and it s the catch phrase in full:

                                        WALTER
                    Up, up, and a limited distance away!!

        Captain Normal emerges from the bar.  He wears a breathing 
      device over his mouth and nose.  Captain Normal surveys 
      the wreckage, and mutters into his cuff mike.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    Send me a cleaner.  There s puke all over 
                      Sunset Boulevard.

                                      END ACT THREE                                                                                    40.



                                          ACT FOUR



      Late night.  No lights in the Spackman house.

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter sits in the dark.  The iMac s Buffy screensaver 
      casts light.  Walter is nervous, on edge.  

      TIME CUT - AT HIS COMPUTER 

      Walter sits at the computer.  He checks the iChat panel.  
        Macklin is on line.  Walter composes a message to him.  
      This is going to sound insane.  But you have to believe 
      me.  Every word is true.  

      Walter stops.  He s not sure how to put the impossible 
      into words.  Walter looks away from the computer.  When he 
      looks back?  Troy Hamilton peers at him from the screen.  
      Walter reacts with yelping surprise.

                                        TROY
                      Sorry to pop in like this.  I just wanted 
                    to see how you were doing.                                                                                    41.



                                        WALTER
                      Doing great.  Never better.  Super good.

                                        TROY
                      You re scared to death.

                                        WALTER
                      Every cell in my body is screaming.  
                      That s seventy trillion cells.

                                        TROY
                    Do something for me?  Step to the window.  
                    Look at the stars.

      Walter steps to the window.

                                        WALTER
                      I can t see them.  But that s mostly due 
                    to the city lights, and there may also be 
                      a cloud or smog layer --

                                        TROY
                      Walter.  You can t see the stars but you 
                    know they re up there.  That s not faith 
                    or a good guess.  It s a fact.  The 
                      courage inside you is like the stars.  
                    You can t see it, but it s there.  That s 
                      a fact.

      Walter keeps his eyes on the sky.  Then, as much to 
        himself as to Hamilton:

                                        WALTER
                      I decided at a very early age, four 
                      actually, to learn the answer to every 
                      question.  And I did, to the exclusion of 
                      almost everything else, and then one day 
                      there I was, and my head is full of 
                      answers and that s when I realized I 
                      forgot all the questions.  Except the 
                      first one.

                                        TROY
                    What was your first question?

                                        WALTER
                       Where s Dad? 

                                        TROY
                    You never knew your father.

                                        WALTER
                      I was only three when he died.

                                        TROY
                      A boy should know his Dad.

      Walter looks back to the iMac screen.                                                                                    42.



                                        WALTER
                      I got a box of his old records.  And a 
                      photograph.  I used to keep it by my bed.  
                    But it wasn t a memory.  It was just a 
                      picture.  Like an insert in a frame you 
                    buy.  All that did was make me sadder.  I 
                    put it away.

                                        TROY
                    Do me a favor?  Put it back.

                                        WALTER
                      Okay.

                                        TROY
                    Get some sleep.  Big day, tomorrow.
                    Good night, son.

      Son.  It s a companionable descriptive.  But it feels like 
      more than that to Walter.  Troy Hamilton reaches OFF-
        SCREEN, disconnects. 



      Night.  Limousines idle outside the Four Seasons Hotel.

      INSIDE THE HOTEL

      PAVEL HUSAK sits at the hotel bar.  Husak is a quiet man 
      of middle age.  He wears a bespoke suit and a blank 
        expression.  He drinks a glass of wine.  A BODYGUARD sits 
      beside him.  The BARTENDER sets his drink on the bar.

                                          BARTENDER S VOICE
                    Club soda and lime.

      The bartender is Time Zone.  The bodyguard takes a sip.  
      Time Zone takes a closer look at him.

      TIME CUT - AT THE END OF THE BAR 

      Time Zone winces through a headache.  He speaks into a 
      cuff mike.

                                        TIME ZONE
                      Men s room.

      ON A SOFA

        Captain Normal sits on a sofa.  He wears a suit.  He 
      cleans up nice.  Captain Normal speaks into a cuff mike.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    You heard the lady.  Move.

      THREE MERCS in track suits move to the rest rooms.  
        Captain Normal walks out of the lounge.                                                                                    43.



      AT THE BAR

      Pavel Husak s bodyguard grunts, grabs at his stomach.  He 
      races to the men s room before his bowels explode.  A 
        beautiful woman takes his place.  It s Mood Swing in a 
      black cocktail dress.  Mood Swing cleans up more than 
      nice.  She s stunning.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Hello, Doctor Husak.

      Husak suddenly is filled with warmth, contentment, and 
        memory.  He looks at Mood Swing with absolute wonder.

                                        HUSAK
                      I almost forgot.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    What did you forget?

                                        HUSAK
                      Solovyovo.  Home.  There is an island in 
                    the middle of the lake and there are 
                      ruins of a church on the island.  It is 
                    said that the bones of a saint are buried 
                    in the soil.
                                (beat)
                      I was only eight years old.  We took an 
                    old rowboat, my sister Vladka and me.  We 
                      rowed to the island and we looked for the 
                      bones.  Vladka.  I haven t thought about 
                    her in years.

      Husak is captive to happiness.  Mood Swing knows just when 
      to make her move.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Tell me where it is, Pavel.

                                        HUSAK
                      What?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    The package.



      Husak steps from the hotel.  He shakes his head to clear 
      it.  He remembers what he told the young woman inside.  
      Husak reaches inside his jacket for a cell phone.  But a 
      panel van smokes into view, the side door OPENS, Captain 
      Normal GRABS Husak from behind, and SHOVES him inside.  
        Captain Normal watches the van speed away.  A beat.  Mood 
      Swing steps beside him.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      Where to?                                                                                    44.



                                        MOOD SWING
                    San Pedro.



      San Pedro.  START CLOSE on a pair of black military boots 
      stepping on pavement.  We HEAR a man s VOICE OVER:

                                        MAN S VOICE
                      Kobe s the better player, sure.  But 
                      LeBron is playin  better.  Aiight?

        ANOTHER ANGLE reveals a GUARD in helmet and bulletproof 
      vest.  He patrols the perimeter around a warehouse close 
      to the docks.  He continues into his headset mike.

                                        GUARD
                    It s like Alicia Keys.  She s got the 
                      skills, but she s not makin  great songs. 

      We HEAR another GUARD respond over the first guard s 
      headset.  He has a deep basso voice.

                                        GUARD #2 S VOICE
                    This makes sense to me, of course.  
                      However, while gaining an NBA title, 
                      Mister Kobe has become a far better 
                      player, attaining previously unheard-of 
                      performance levels.  Dog.

                                        GUARD
                      Bernard?  You sound funny.  

        A beat.  The second guard SHOUTS with fear and alarm.

                                        GUARD #2 S VOICE
                      Omigod.  No, no, NO!!  HELP!!

      AT THE WAREHOUSE

      The first guard runs around a corner.  He SEES the second 
      guard lying face-down on the pavement.  He races to his 
      side, kneels to check his condition.

                                        GUARD
                      Bernard -- ?

      At which point, Captain Normal, wearing the guard s 
      uniform, rolls, and gun-butts him in the face.  The guard 
        collapses in a heap.  The team emerges from the shadows.  
      Myna Bird wears the first guard s headset.  She speaks one 
      more line in the man s deep basso voice.

                                        MYNAH BIRD
                      I need to work on my sports information 
                    and trivia.                                                                                    45.



                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    No kidding.  Dog.

      The team wears bodysuits.  Mood Swing s fits her like a 
      second skin.  The Human Smell?  Not so much.  

      AT THE DOOR

      Walter kneels at a warehouse door.  He s nervous, but he s 
      eager, too.  He feels like James Bond.  Walter indicates 
      the lock.

                                        WALTER
                      Schlage Tulip.  Piece of cake.

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Tulip.  The name reminded him of flowers 
                    and where the Dutch live.  How ironic.  
                    The thing designed to keep him out is 
                    also the name of --

      Everyone turns to The Human Smell.  Not now. 

                                        WALTER
                    It s not ironic, per se.  It s actually 
                    more like a coincidence --

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    We get in, we get out.  Retrieve the 
                      package and deliver it to HQ.  
                      Understood?



        Captain Normal slides the van door open.  He deposits 
      Cassie inside.  The rest of the team follows.  Captain 
      Normal steps to the driver s side door.  Walter remains.

                                        WALTER
                    Wait a minute.  Nobody told us she was 
                    the package.  We don t even know what she 
                    was doing there.  Maybe somebody should 
                    tell us just what the hell is --

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    Get in the van.

                                        WALTER
                      She s not a package.  She s a girl.

        Captain Normal gets behind the wheel.   

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Walter.  Please.

        A beat.  Walter hurries into the van with the others.



      An intersection.  There are no cars in sight.  We HEAR the 
      sound of an approaching vehicle.  The light turns red.  No 
        matter.  The van speeds through the light.

      IN THE VAN

      Team members sit on benches in the back.  Cassie gradually 
        regains her senses.  Her eyes fill with fear.  

                                        MOOD SWING
                    It s all right.  Don t be --

      Cassie darts toward the door.  Walter grabs the ten year-
      old before she can open it.

                                        WALTER
                    We won t hurt you.  We re here to help.  
                      Maybe this is a rescue op or --

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    Cuff her.                                                                                    50.



      The Bugmaster reaches for restraints hooked to the wall. 

                                        WALTER
                      What?!

                                        MOOD SWING
                    We can handle this!

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    I ve got an idea.  Why don t you ask Time 
                    Zone what s going to happen if you don t 
                    shut up and follow orders!

      The Bugmaster aims a cuff at Cassie s arm.  Mood Swing 
      shoves The Bugmaster against the van wall.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Happy or sad?  It s your call.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    What the hell -- ?

                                        WALTER
                      Until we get to HQ, until Mister Hamilton 
                      tells us what s going on?  Nobody gets 
                      cuffed.

      The van speeds toward another intersection.

                                        WALTER
                      We re the good guys, remember?

      Which is the exact moment an armor-plated black sedan 
      meets them in the intersection, T-BONES the van, sends 
      both vehicles SPINNING --

      IN THE INTERSECTION

      The van and the sedan each come to a smoking halt on 
      opposite sides of the intersection.

      IN THE VAN

      Everyone in the van is stunned, but uninjured.  Walter 
      holds Cassie in a protecting embrace.  Mood Swing slides 
      the van door open.  And Captain Normal?  He slips nimbly 
      out the driver s side window, lands on his feet, and takes 
        purposeful strides toward the sedan.

      AT THE SEDAN

      There are two HUGE MEN inside.  Samoans with prison tats 
      and great bushy hair roped into ponytails.  The driver 
        struggles to open his door.  The second Samoan pushes at 
      the passenger side.  Captain Normal KICKS and SLAMS the 
      driver s side door on the first Samoan as he tries to 
      exit.  The Samoan crumples to the ground.  The passenger, 
      now on his feet, aims a revolver at Captain Normal over                                                                                     51.



      the roof of the sedan.  But Captain Normal DUCKS down, 
        returns FIRE through the interior.  The second Samoan 
      crumples like the first.  Walter sees it and:

                                        WALTER
                      Omigod.

        Captain Normal strides back to the van, shouts an order:  

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    Call HQ.  We re going to need new wheels 
                    and a backup --

      But a THIRD SAMOAN rolls out the rear door of the sedan, 
      and SHOOTS Captain Normal in the back.  Captain Normal 
      falls to the street.  A second armor-plated black sedan 
        barrels toward the intersection.  Mood Swing shouts:

                                        MOOD SWING
                    RUN.



        Walter, Mood Swing, and little Cassie run down a dark 
      alley.  The third Samoan follows them.  We HEAR the second 
      sedan SCREECH to a halt.  Doors OPEN and CLOSE.  Walter 
      and Mood Swing reach the end of the alley, hurry around 
      the building.  But Cassie stops and faces the Samoan.  As 
      if to fight him somehow.  But then we SEE it in her face.  
      Whatever she planned, it s not working.  

      AN EMPTY STREET

        Walter, Mood Swing, and Cassie run through a deserted 
        neighborhood.  

                                        WALTER
                    Who are those guys?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    No idea.  Door.

      Mood Swing indicates a door into an abandoned building.  
      Walter looks to the lock.  But --

                                        WALTER
                      I can only do this for a limited period 
                    of time.  Then it goes away until my body 
                      recharges.  It s like the electromagnetic 
                      energy inside me --

      No matter.  Mood Swing KICKS the door open.  



        Walter, Mood Swing, and Cassie run down a deserted street.  
      They can HEAR shouts in the distance. 

                                        WALTER
                      Can t you make them unbearably happy or 
                    sad?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    I m not close enough to do that.

                                        WALTER
                    So your power is limited by how close you 
                    are to the target just like mine  --

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Do you mind if we discuss this later?

      Walter spots a lot bordered by chicken wire fence.  He 
      peers through the gate.  Mood Swing sees what he SEES.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      You re kidding me.

      TIME CUT - ON THE STREET 

      Four gasping Samoans run to the same fence and gate.  They 
      HEAR the sound of something coming.  An OLD SCHOOL BUS 
      blows through the gate.  The Samoans scatter.  



      Walter s at the wheel.  Mood Swing and Cassie beside him.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Now what?

                                        WALTER
                      Drive to Granada Hills?

                                        MOOD SWING
                      We ll never make it.

      Mood Swing looks out the rear.  Walter checks the side 
        mirror.  It s an armor-plated black sedan.  Then a 
        surprise.  A motorcycle appears out of nowhere, right next 
      to the sedan.  Walter assumes the worst.

                                        WALTER
                    Come on.  That s just overkill.

      But then the rider TOSSES something inside the sedan.  A 
      loud POP is HEARD.  The sedan FILLS with smoke, crashes to 
        a halt.  Walter, Mood Swing, and Cassie celebrate inside 
      the bus.  But then the motorcycle rider, wearing a helmet                                                                                     54.



      with a mirror visor, chases after them.  The rider pulls 
      out a gun.  And FIRES at the tires of the school bus.

                                        WALTER
                    Now who s chasing us?

                                        MOOD SWING
                      I have no idea.  But it s starting to 
                    piss me off.

      The shots TAKE OUT the bus s rear tires.  Cassie SCREAMS.  
      Walter steers the crippled vehicle to the curb.  Mood 
      Swing hurries Cassie to the door.  But then:

                                        WALTER
                    No.  Stay here.

        Because Walter means to face the rider by himself.

      ON THE STREET

      Walter steps from the bus.  He walks at the rider.  The 
      rider walks at him.  The rider aims the gun at Walter s 
      heart.  Walter stops.  He looks hard at a metal 
        construction plate on the street between them.  The rider 
      keeps coming.  Walter moves the plate an inch.  Then 
      another.  Walter looks even harder at the metal plate.  
      Walter feels a sharp pain behind his eyes.  But then, and 
      at the last possible moment, it moves, and the rider STEPS 
      on the metal plate, the plate gives way, the rider YELPS, 
      and sinks from sight.  

      Walter drags the metal plate over the opening.  He can 
      HEAR angry moaning below.  Walter wonders if he can hold 
      the plate in place.  Then one last surprise.  Mood Swing 
      backs up the school bus, and parks on top of the metal 
      plate.  Mood Swing and Cassie hurry to the street.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Nice work, Three Inches.

      Walter looks at her with disbelief.

                                        WALTER
                      I thought we were taking things.  
                      Retrieval and delivery.  That s all.  
                    I ve never done anything like this 
                      before.  People are hurt, people are 
                      dying.  You saw what happened, Captain 
                      Normal, you saw what happened --
                                (beat)
                      I don t want to be Three Inches anymore.  
                      I quit.  My name is Walter Spackman. 

      It all poured right out of him.  And now he s done.

                                      END ACT FOUR                                                                                    55.



                                          ACT FIVE



        Walter, Mood Swing, and Cassie wait in a deserted 
        warehouse district.  Walter is nervous and on edge. 

                                        WALTER
                      Where are they?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    It s only been five minutes.

      Walter looks off into the night.  Mood Swing looks at the 
      necklace Cassie is wearing.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Where did you get that?

                                        CASSIE
                    The bad men gave it to me if I promised 
                    to stop crying.

      Mood Swing rips it off her neck, drops it on the ground, 
      and stomps the necklace to pieces.  Walter protests.

                                        WALTER
                    I m not sure taking it out on the 
                      necklace is really going to help --

                                        MOOD SWING
                    It s a tracking device!

      Mood Swing pulls Cassie off into the night.  A beat.  
      Walter follows.



      Walter drives another stolen car through the night.  Mood 
      Swing sits in the passenger seat.  Cassie s in the back.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    They can t track us anymore.  

                                        WALTER
                    But they knew we were coming.  They 
                      probably know about HQ, too.  The only 
                    safe place is the last place they d look.

                                        CASSIE
                    We can t just drive around all night.

                                        WALTER
                      I know a place we can go.                                                                                    56.




      Morning.  Walter and Mood Swing sleep.  Mood Swing rests 
      her head on his shoulder.  Cassie WATCHES them with a 
        knowing gaze.  She slips off the bed, and out of the room.

      ON THE STREET                                                                                    60.



        Macklin returns to the restaurant with bagels and coffee.  
      Then he SEES something unexpected.  Cassie exits and 
        hurries away.  A beat.  Macklin follows her.



        A familiar street, school bus, and metal construction 
      plate.  A supersized TOW TRUCK drags the bus into the 
        distance.  CAMERA PUSHES IN.  The metal plate MOVES.  TWO 
      HANDS grip the edge and SHOVE it to the street.  An ARM 
      SLAMS the motocycle helmet onto the pavement.  The 
        motorcycle rider rises into view.  It s a YOUNG WOMAN, 
      about 30, with choppy blonde hair.  Her name is CATE.  



      Union Station is an architectural marvel and local legend.

      IN THE WAITING ROOM

      Walter and Mood Swing meet Macklin on the periphery.  
        Macklin indicates Cassie sitting on one of the burnished 
      wooden benches in the waiting room.                                                                                    62.



                                        MACKLIN
                      She s been here all morning.  

                                        MOOD SWING
                    You didn t make contact?

                                        MACKLIN
                    Are you kidding?  What if she has laser 
                      beams in her eyes?

                                        WALTER
                      Look.

      Cate steps through the vast interior.  

                                        WALTER
                    The mysterious motorcycle rider is a 
                      woman.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Keep her busy.  I ll get Cassie.

      Mood Swing hurries to the bench.  Walter and Macklin turn 
      to face Cate.  Macklin holds up two palms. 

                                        MACKLIN
                      Look.  Easy Rider.  I don t want to hurt 
                    you --

      Cate drops Macklin with a swift kick to the solar plexus.

                                        CATE
                    You want some?

                                        WALTER
                    I m good.  Thanks.

      The SOUND of HEAVY BOOTS interrupts.  Captain Normal leads 
      an extraction team into the building.  The combat-suited 
      MERCS grab Cassie.  Cassie SEES Cate and she SHOUTS:

                                        CASSIE
                      Cate!!!

      The team heads for the door.  Cate CHARGES after them.  
        Captain Normal SEES her coming.  Cate SHOUTS:

                                        CATE
                      Cassie!!

        Captain Normal LEVELS Cate with a single punch to the jaw.  
      He follows the extraction team out the door.  Walter runs 
      to Cate, and kneels at her side. 

                                        WALTER
                    Who are you?                                                                                    63.



                                        CATE
                    I m her sister.



      Walter stands outside with Captain Normal.  An armor 
      plated Humvee idles at the curb.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      I figured you d try something like this.  
                    So I played Follow The Wiener.  You are 
                    the Wiener.

                                        WALTER
                        Congratulations.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    You think I m stupid, don t you?

                                        WALTER
                    Not any more.

        Captain Normal indicates the Humvee, Cassie inside it.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      Sucks to be her.

                                        WALTER
                    Why?

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    We transfer  the package  to the client 
                    in the morning.

      IN UNION STATION

      Mood Swing and Macklin sit with Cate on a bench.  Walter 
      joins them.  Cate looks up at Walter.

                                        WALTER
                      Cassie s special, isn t she?

                                        CATE
                    In ways no one really understands.
                      We ve been on the run since the day she 
                      found out.  I do whatever it takes to 
                      protect her.  But it s never enough 

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Who are the Samoans working for?

                                        CATE
                      They re new.  I don t know.

                                        WALTER
                    Do you know who was holding her?                                                                                    64.



                                        CATE
                      Government.

                                        WALTER
                      Really?  I m not sure I believe  --

                                        CATE
                    Not our government.

      Cate gets to her feet.  She looks hard at Walter.

                                        CATE
                    Who do you work for?

                                        WALTER
                    We don t want to hurt Cassie.  We want to 
                    help her.

                                        CATE
                    You don t believe that.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Yes, he does.

                                        CATE
                    What do you think your boss is going to 
                    do?  He s going to measure and probe my 
                      little sister just like the others did.  
                    And the worst thing is?  When he tells 
                    you he s doing it for the right reasons?  
                      You ll believe that, too.

      Cate shoves past Walter.  He calls after her.

                                        WALTER
                      Where re you going?

                                        CATE
                    To get her back.

      Walter turns to Mood Swing.  

                                        WALTER
                    So that s it?  We re just going to let 
                    them take her?  That s not right.  She s 
                    only a --

                                        MOOD SWING
                    It s over, Walter.  Go home.

      Mood Swing doesn t like this any more than he does.  But 
      she knows there is nothing they can do.



        Afternoon.  Walter moves up the walk toward home.  Then a 
      familiar SOUND, the throaty rumble of a motorcycle.                                                                                      65.



                                        LILY S VOICE
                      Walter!

      Lily sits behind Django on the Vincent Black Shadow.  She 
      hops off the bike and lopes to Walter.  

                                        LILY
                      Where ve you been?  I was away on a job, 
                    but I texted you and you never --
                                (beat)
                      Walter.  Are you okay?

                                        WALTER
                    No.  I m not.

      Walter walks away.



      Night.  The Spackman house is dark.

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter hasn t moved an inch.  The room is dark except for 
      the Buffy screensaver on the iMac screen.  At least until 
      it disappears and is replaced by Troy Hamilton.

                                        TROY
                      Walter?  May I have a word?

      Walter sits, and faces Hamilton on the iMac screen.

                                        TROY
                      Everybody has a secret gift inside.  A 
                      difference.  You just happen to be a 
                      little more in touch with yours than 
                      most.  The trick is to make the very best 
                    of it that you can.

                                        WALTER
                    You already said that.  Word for word.   
                      Mynah Bird does a very good impression.

                                        TROY
                    It s worth repeating.  Your abilities 
                    have been tested.  Sometimes when we re 
                      tested, we start to doubt the thing that 
                      makes us special.

                                        WALTER
                    Is being special always this hard?

                                        TROY
                    It gets easier over time.

                                        WALTER
                      I hope so.

                                        TROY
                      You ll have to trust me on that.  Good 
                      night, son --

      Troy reaches OFF-SCREEN to disconnect.  But:                                                                                    67.



                                        WALTER
                      Mister Hamilton -- how s Cassie?

                                        TROY
                      Cassie is in good hands.  

                                        WALTER
                    What about her sister?

                                        TROY
                    I ll take care of the sister.  

                                        WALTER
                      Whoa, wait.  Her name is Cate and all 
                      she s trying to do is --

                                        TROY
                      Walter.

                                        WALTER
                    Yes?

                                        TROY
                    Get some sleep.  We start fresh in the 
                      morning.  

      It s an order.  Hamilton DISCONNECTS.  Walter sits in the 
      dark.  Then he decides.  Walter walks out the door.



        A Hollywood dive.  Mood Swing sits at the bar.  She came 
      here to be alone.  But men don t always respect her 
        wishes.  That explains the YOUNG MEN to either side, both 
        sniffling quietly.  Mood Swing drinks from a bottle of 
      beer.  One of the men chokes back an audible sob.

                                        WALTER S VOICE 
                    Can I talk to you outside?

      Mood Swing turns, SEES Walter standing there.

      ON THE SIDEWALK

      Walter faces Mood Swing on the sidewalk.

                                        WALTER
                      I went home.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Good idea.

                                        WALTER
                      I can t stop thinking about Cassie.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Bad idea.

                                        WALTER
                      Cassie needs my help so she can be a real 
                    girl but they re transferring her to the 
                      client in the morning and we don t even 
                    know who the client is and then it will 
                    be too late so I m going to save her and 
                      I don t care what the consequences are 
                      because for the first time in my life I 
                    know exactly what to do next.  Also it 
                      would be great if you came with me.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Good speech.

                                        WALTER
                      Thanks.  I usually rehearse them first.



        Midnight.  Macklin s convertible heads up Laurel Canyon.  
      Macklin, Mood Swing, and Walter sit in the front seat.  

                                        MACKLIN
                    How many superfreaks are out there?                                                                                    69.



                                        MOOD SWING
                    It s an HQ, not a sideshow dorm.

                                        WALTER
                    The house is basically empty.  A couple 
                      guards up top.  Heavier concentration 
                      below.  They re armed and they re bored.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Don t forget Captain Normal.  He sleeps 
                      there. 

                                        WALTER
                    He does?

                                        MACKLIN
                    Is Captain Normal normal?

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Don t worry.  I ll take care of him.

                                        WALTER
                    How?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    He likes me.

                                        WALTER
                    What do you mean he likes you?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    If you show up in his bedroom in the 
                      middle of the night?  That s a combat 
                      situation.  But if I do?  He won t be 
                      thinking about mission parameters.

                                        WALTER
                    But he ll know if you alter his mood --

                                        MOOD SWING
                      I don t need a superpower to keep Jason 
                      occupied.

                                        WALTER
                    His name is Jason?  This is a terrible 
                    idea that is not part of the plan --

        Macklin hits the Mullholland light.  The light is red.  
      Cate waits for them there.  She hops into the back seat.  
      The light turns green.  The convertible rolls off.  

                                        WALTER
                    -- There are hundreds of better ways to 
                      handle Captain Normal.  We could blow him 
                    up for example.  I m sure I can find some 
                      explosives.  Is Home Depot open?                                                                                    70.




      The Extraction Team hurries out the door of the house.  
      But they re not headed toward a Team van.  They usher 
      Cassie into Macklin s convertible.  ANOTHER ANGLE reveals 
      the latter to be the Samoans  POV.  In two sedans.  This 
      is what they were waiting for.  When the convertible rolls 
      off into the night, they follow.

      AT AN INTERSECTION

      The convertible stops at a red light.  The sedans SCREECH 
      into view.  The convertible is trapped between.  The 
        Samoans pour out of the sedans, hurry to the convertible.  
      And SEE the very last thing they expected.

      The Extraction Team members REMOVE their helmets.  It s 
      Mynah Bird, The Bugmaster, and Time Zone.  The Human Smell 
      wears Cassie s red nightgown.  It s not a great fit.  
      Mynah Bird calls off the all-clear into a headset mike.  
      In the VOICE of Troy Hamilton.

                                        MYNAH BIRD
                      Attention all units.  Stand down.  The 
                      intruders are in custody.  The subject is 
                      secure.  HQ code is clear.

                                        SAMOAN
                    What the hell -- ?!

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Shock filled their brains with awe.  Who 
                    were these strangers, why were they here, 
                    and where was the little girl in red?  
                    Then the night sang with the sound --                                                                                    73.



      They all turn to The Human Smell.  He shrugs apology.

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Sorry.

      Then a SOUND as heard, as promised.  It s the BUZZING 
      sound of BEES.  The Samoans swipe at their heads.  They 
      run in crazy circles.

        ANOTHER ANGLE

      CAMERA VIEWS the intersection from a DISTANCE.  The 
        Samoans circle and swipe.  We HEAR their anguished cries 
      in the dark.



      A mini mall on Chatsworth Street.  Cate is back on the 
        motorcycle.  Little Cassie sits behind her.  Walter and 
        Macklin face them.  

                                        WALTER
                      Where will you go?

                                        CATE
                      A safe place.

                                        WALTER
                      We ll never see you again.

                                        CATE
                      I hope not.

      Walter looks to Cassie holding her sister tight.  

                                        WALTER
                    You can be a real girl now.  

                                        CASSIE
                    What about you?

                                        WALTER
                    I m exactly me.

      In this way, Walter accepts the world as it is.  Three 
      inches at a time.  Cate fires up the bike.

                                        WALTER
                      Goodbye, Cassie.

                                        CASSIE
                       Bye, Walter.  Thanks!

      And with that, and a deep WHOMP, Cassie TURNS OUT every 
      LIGHT for a hundred miles.  The San Fernando Valley goes 
        completely DARK.  We HEAR the motorcycle ROAR off into the 
      black.  Walter and Macklin deadpan:                                                                                    74.



                                        WALTER S VOICE
                      Sweet kid.

                                        MACKLIN S VOICE
                    Cute as a button.

      Then a second WHOMP, and the lights RETURN.  As if Cassie 
        flicked a single switch.  But the motorcycle is nowhere in 
      sight.  Walter and Macklin remain.  Fixed in place by 
      their own amazement. 

                                        MACKLIN
                      Hungry?

                                        WALTER
                      Starving.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Cantor s is open.

                                        WALTER
                      Let s eat.



      Sunrise.  Walter sits on the park bench on top of the 
        Hollywood Hills.  He watches the morning advance.  Mood 
      Swing sits down beside him.  She watches the morning, too.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    This is nice.

                                        WALTER
                    It s my new favorite place.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Why?

                                        WALTER
                    This is where lightning hit me.

      It s also where Lily broke his heart.  But Walter isn t 
      thinking about that now.

                                        WALTER
                    How did it go with Captain Normal?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    No problem.  How about you?

                                        WALTER
                      Cassie turned off every light in the 
                      city.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      I noticed.                                                                                    75.



                                        WALTER
                    We did the right thing.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    You did, Walter.  The rest of us helped.

        A beat.  Mood Swing turns to him:

                                        MOOD SWING
                      I don t have many friends.  I hope you 
                    will be my friend.

                                        WALTER
                    Why?

                                        MOOD SWING
                      You re super smart.  Funny.  And easy to 
                    talk to.

                                        WALTER
                      Everybody wants to be my friend.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Another superpower?

                                        WALTER
                      Sometimes it feels more like an 
                      unnecessary limitation.

      Mood Swing looks back to the morning. 

                                        MOOD SWING
                    My name is Tess.  It s my secret 
                      identity.

      It s an unexpected confession.  A beat.  Walter looks back 
      to the morning, too.  



      The drab 1950s ranch house in Granada Hills.

      IN THE LIVING ROOM

      Troy Hamilton assembles the team.  He paces and shouts.  

                                        TROY
                    How can I make it clear to you, really 
                      clear, that I m not just angry, I m 
                      betrayed, and that s a --

      Walter and Mood Swing enter, interrupt.  Hamilton darkens.

                                        TROY 
                      You re late.                                                                                    76.



                                        WALTER
                    You can t tell me I m late.  I quit.

                                        TROY
                      What?

                                        WALTER
                      I set Cassie free.  It s my fault.

      But then, Mood Swing steps beside him.  And repeats:

                                        MOOD SWING
                      I set Cassie free.  It s my fault.

      One by one, they get to their feet.  The Bugmaster first, 
      tall and pale.   Mynah Bird, who looks like a Korean 
        housewife.  Time Zone, too.  And each time, they repeat:

                                        THE TEAM 
                      I set Cassie free.  It s my fault.

      The Human Smell narrates.  Nobody thinks to stop him.

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    They rose to their feet and ripped off an 
                    old movie my dad would never shut up 
                      about that has this guy in it with a big 
                    dent in his chin.  They did it because 
                    they were a team.  They did it because 
                    the guy before them did it.  They did it 
                    to blow your mind.

      Troy looks from one to the next.  Captain Normal is the 
      last to rise.  But not to play along.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    HQ is my responsibility.  It s my fault.  
                    I m sorry, Dad.

      Dad.  Walter tilts.  He speaks aside:

                                        WALTER
                      Dad?!

                                        MOOD SWING
                    You didn t know?

                                        WALTER
                    Not if nobody tells me.

                                        TROY
                      Walter.

      Hamilton interrupts the back and forth.  

                                        TROY
                      Follow me.                                                                                    77.




        Midday.  Walter steps toward home.  But first he detours 
      to Lily Theroux s front door.  Walter rings, waits.  Lily 
      answers.  

                                        LILY
                      Walter, hi --

      Walter gives Lily a great big KISS.  Then he walks away.  
        A beat.  Lily puts her fingertips to her lips.

      IN THE LIVING ROOM

        Belinda sits on the sofa, sucks on an unlit cigarette, and 
      waits for her increasingly wayward son.  Again.  She HEARS 
      the door open, gets to her feet.  She opens her mouth to 
        censure or complain.  But Walter interrupts:

                                        WALTER
                    When I was struck by lightning a strange 
                      power was given to me and while I 
                      resisted it at first, abused it after 
                      that, I eventually found common cause 
                    with a group of similarly gifted men and 
                      women who fight evil.  So basically I m 
                    not washing dogs anymore.  I m going to 
                    save the world instead.

      The unlit cigarette drops from Belinda Spackman s mouth.

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter enters his bedroom.  He opens the box of his 
      father s records.  Walter fits a disc to spindle and 
      platter.  Walter puts the needle to the groove.  It s  Are 
      You Ready  by Pacific Gas & Electric and the music BLASTS 
      even louder than before.  Walter stands at the center of 
      the room.  

      Walter begins to dance.  Just a twitch at first.  But then 
      his body finds the rhythm, and he leaps and jukes and 
      slides all over the room.  Walter Spackman is a terrible 
        dancer.  Walter Spackman has never been happier in his 
      life.

                                          THE END
