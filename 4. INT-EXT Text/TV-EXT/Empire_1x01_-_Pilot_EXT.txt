      An incredible PARTY on a huge YACHT (the recording studio is *
      on a yacht!). The ship is packed with PEOPLE, mostly African-*
      American, dressed in upscale clothes. 

      On the lower deck holding court is HAKEEM LYON, 20, swag, *
      beautiful, ripped and charming. A bad boy that all the girls 
      love. He s focused on two HOTTIES in bikinis, both 19. 

                                  HAKEEM
                    I wanna change the culture with my 
                    music. You know what I m saying? 
                    Like the way Shakespeare and Van 
                    Gogh pushed society forward with 
                    their art. 

      Like a group of sycophants, everyone nods in agreement. 

      CUT TO - ANOTHER PART OF THE SHIP. 

      Sitting by himself is JAMAL LYON, 24, not bad looking, shy, 
      sensitive. Jamal plays his guitar, it s soulful and beautiful 
      (a la Miguel). No one notices him and he doesn t care. 

      Hakeem walks over, watches his brother with a cocky grin. 

                                  HAKEEM (CONT D)
                    Sounds good, Mal. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Thanks. 

      Jamal starts STRUMMING a fast up-tempo tune, it sounds 
      guttural. Raw. Hakeem s eyes light up, loves it. Hakeem 
      starts DRUMMING his hands on a nearby wooden chair, the sound 
      fits in perfectly with the music Jamal is playing. 

      A CROWD starts to form watching them freestyle. Folks nod *
      their heads to the music being created right on the spot. 
      Hakeem starts RAPPING free form lyrics.*

      Brothers. So close that they can read each others minds. *
      Impromptu. Both massively talented. Magic. The crowd starts *
      clapping along.                                                                                      4.


      CUT TO - UPPER DECK OF THE SHIP.

      Watching from two decks up is their older brother ANDRE LYON, 
      27, tall, brilliant, but with a dark, depressed side. He 
      dresses conservatively, khaki pants and button down shirt. 

      Andre does not look entertained watching his brothers. 
      Standing next to him is his wife, RHONDA LYON, 26, white, 
      sexy and manipulative. She also watches with annoyance. 

                                  RHONDA
                    Your brothers are showing off 
                    again. 

                                  ANDRE
                    It s what they do best. *
                          (Then)*
                    I m surprised Hakeem is performing. 

                                  RHONDA
                    Why?

                                  ANDRE
                    He likes to save it for when dad is *
                    around. *



      A black SUV pulls up to the Gehry-esque marvel that s EMPIRE 
      ENTERTAINMENT. A group of FANS and AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS wait 
      outside the building behind SECURITY GUARDS. 

      As the SUV pulls up, Lucious hurries out followed by Anika,  *
      in dark sunglasses. They look as cool as can be, not a care *
      in the world. *

      The crowd goes crazy, yelling, taking pictures, several hold *
      pictures and CD cases of Lucious to sign, which he does. *



      The steel gates to the prison slide open up and out walks 
      COOKIE LYON, late 40 s, thick, sexy as hell and a total bad 
      ass. Wearing a 20 year old mink coat, she smokes a cigarette.                                                                                       7.


      There is a fire in Cookie s eyes, a determination. She looks 
      ready for vengeance as she mumbles to herself: 

                                  COOKIE
                    Cookie s coming home. 

                                  END OF TEASER



      A much younger and PREGNANT Cookie stands in front of 
      connected row houses in a run down neighborhood. Younger 
      Lucious stands behind her, his hands covering her eyes. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    You ready?

      She nods. He removes his hands and she sees her new home. 
      It s a rundown house with chipped paint and cracks in the 
      windows. Cookie tears up as she gives Lucious a huge hug. 

                                  COOKIE
                    It s beautiful. 

      CUT BACK TO - PRESENT DAY 

      Cookie smiles at the memory. She then sees a picture of 
      Lucious and Anika on his desk causing her smile to fade. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    When did you get out?

      Cookie turns around and faces Lucious. They stare at each 
      other for a long, painful beat. It s been so many years. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Two days ago. 

      He walks over and gives her a hug. She slowly hugs him back. 
      It s awkward but they still have strong feelings. Then - she 
      SLAPS him across the face! Hard! Lucious staggers back. 

                                  COOKIE (CONT D)
                    You black bastard. The only one 
                    that came was Jamal. He s the only 
                    one.*

      Cookie is so pained that she can hardly get the words out.*

                                  COOKIE (CONT D)*
                    How could you do that to me?                                                                                    19.


                                    LUCIOUS
                    For awhile I thought about you 
                    everyday. But I couldn t take it. I 
                    had to try to forget about you. I m 
                    sorry, Cookie, I really am, but it 
                    was too painful for me. I couldn t 
                    take it anymore.  

      Part of her understands, but it doesn t stop the hurt. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Yeah. I get it. But that doesn t 
                    mean I have to accept it.  

      She stares daggers at him, Lucious looks nervous.

                                    LUCIOUS
                    So how d you get out so early?

                                  COOKIE
                    That s all you got to say to me!?

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I don t know what else to say. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Then don t say anything. You forgot 
                    about me the second you divorced me 
                    in there. But that doesn t mean you 
                    don t owe me what s mine. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    What are you talking about?

                                  COOKIE
                    Half this company. It was my 
                    $400,000 that started this bitch. 
                    You know it and I know it. I did 17 
                    hard years for that money, and I 
                    want half my company back. 

      Lucious is at a loss for words, not sure how to explain this:

                                    LUCIOUS
                      Cookie...it doesn t work like that. 

                                  COOKIE
                    It doesn t work like what?

                                    LUCIOUS
                    You wanna house? You want money? 
                    I ll get it for you. You ll be *
                    taken care of Cookie but I can t 
                    give you half the company.                                                                                     20.


                                  COOKIE
                    It s mine.

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I only control 10% now. I ve had *
                    investors come in over the years, 
                    it s why we re so big. I have a 
                    Board of Directors, a CFO, SEC 
                    filings. We re about to go public *
                    which will dilute my voting power 
                    even more.

                                  COOKIE
                    Public?! What the hell is going 
                    public?

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I can give you a huge salary, but I 
                    can t give you half the company. I 
                    can t give you any of it. 

                                  COOKIE
                    But it s mine. This is mine. I 
                    started this!
                          (COLD)*
                    You need to stop playin with me.*

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Tell me what you want and you can 
                    have it.

      She stares at him for a long beat. Then -

                                  COOKIE
                    I want five million a year and I 
                    want to be head of A & R. 

      Slight beat. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    The money is tricky. I ll figure *
                    something out.
                          (Then)
                    I can t do A & R. We have someone. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Fire them. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I can t. 

      Cookie nods toward the picture of Lucious and Anika.                                                                                     21.


                                  COOKIE
                    Is it little Halle Berry over 
                    there? 

      Lucious stares at her, the answer clearly yes. Cookie sucks 
      up what little dignity she has left as she walks out the 
      door. Never looking back: 

                                  COOKIE (CONT D)
                    You re not sweeping me under the 
                    carpet, Lucious.

      Lucious watches her, concerned. She s the only person alive *
      that makes him nervous. *



      A furious Cookie hails a taxi on a crowded New York street 
      and dives into the back seat. 



      Bunkie speaks into the intercom outside the gates of an *
      ornate castle like building.*

                                    BUNKIE*
                    Bunkie Johnson. *

      There is a slight beat. Then the door buzzes open. Bunkie *
      walks through the courtyard to a large building in the back *
      that looks like horse stables. *



      In the alley behind their house, Lucious carries a crying 
      Jamal over to a GARBAGE CAN and shoves him in it. He lifts 
      the metal lid up in the air. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    You re nothing but garbage. 

      He shuts the lid on Jamal whose CRYING can be heard through 
      the alley as Lucious walks back to his house. 

                                  8 YEAR-OLD JAMAL
                    Please, daddy! Don t leave me here! 

      Cookie appears from nowhere.

                                  COOKIE
                    Are you out of your GODDAMNED mind? 
                    Nigga you must be crazy!

      She jumps on Lucious s back, scratching him. An ugly fight! *
      He finally SHOVES her off. She heads straight to the trash *
      can in tears and removes her traumatized son. Cradles his 
      trembling body. Lucious looks away. His anger turns to 
      sadness and then fear, he s truly scared for his son. 

      CUT BACK TO - PRESENT: *



      An hour later, Cookie and Andre sit on the balcony sharing a 
      cigarette, both drink scotch. They look comfortable together. 

                                  ANDRE
                    Did you know Lucious is taking the 
                    company public?

                                  COOKIE
                    Yeah, he mentioned it when he was 
                    trying to screw me out of my money. 

                                  ANDRE
                    As part of going public, he needs 
                    to pick a successor. 

                                  COOKIE

                    superstar so he can be the face of 
                    Empire. *

                                  COOKIE
                    Shouldn t be too hard, the boys got 
                    it. He s no Jamal, but he s good. 

                                  ANDRE
                    Have you ever thought about 
                    managing Jamal? 

                                  COOKIE
                    For years. I told Lucious I wanted *
                    to be head of A and R just so I 
                    could manage Jamal, but he s 
                    shutting me out. 

                                  ANDRE
                    He doesn t want Jamal to be a star--

                                  COOKIE
                    --because it would position him to 
                    be the face of the company. *

                                  ANDRE*
                    He wants it for Hakeem, Momma. 

      Cookie eyes him over for a beat. What is he getting at?

                                  COOKIE
                    How do you feel about that?

                                  ANDRE
                    I want Empire. I d be lying if I *
                    told you I didn t. I know you ve *

                    company. Momma I have. Real hard.*
                          (then)
                    But I know I m not an artist, and *
                    dad s right, it s a celebrity *
                    driven brand. It needs a star as *
                    the face of it. *

      Cookie nods. Saddened by the truth her son is telling.

                    So I want Jamal to be the head of 
                    this company. He s the most 
                    talented, he s hard working and 
                    he s sensible. Hakeem s arrogant 
                    and could possibly destroy it all 
                    if he s in charge.                                                                                     36.

                    So what do you want from me?

                                  ANDRE
                    I want you to manage Jamal. You can 
                    make him a star, just like you made 
                    dad a star. 

                                  COOKIE
                    But I got no leverage to force 
                    Lucious into giving me Jamal. 

                                  ANDRE
                    You have more than you realize.

      Cookies leans in, intrigued.

                    And what s that?

      Slight beat. Andre stares at her with pain in his eyes. 

                                  ANDRE
                    Do you really love me, ma?

      Cookie takes his hand. 

                                  COOKIE
                    More than you ll ever love me.



      Cookie and Jamal walk through the artsy, hipster *

      He stares at her for a long beat. She makes a great argument, 
      but he still shakes his head. He points to the Coffee House.                                                                                     40.

      Jamal has finished off his set and is packing up his 
      equipment by himself. Hakeem watches him from the back of the 
      room, he starts to laugh. Jamal sees him.

                                  JAMAL
                    What s so funny?

                                  HAKEEM
                    That shit about Dad being in the 
                      Illuminati. Hilarious!

      Jamal smiles. Hakeem s face suddenly fills with concern. 

                                  HAKEEM (CONT D)
                    I need your help. 

      CUT TO - LATER. The brothers are seated at a table listening 
      to one of Hakeem s recordings on his iPhone. Jamal digs it. 

                                  JAMAL
                    It s good, real good. But something 
                    is missing, it s not totally you. *
                    It doesn t have your fire.

                                  HAKEEM
                    Ever since dad told me he wanted to 
                    cut this album, I ve gotten scared, 
                    you know? I feel like I ve lost my 
                      confidence. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Let me ask you, do you want this? 
                    Do you really want to be dad? 

      Hakeem stares at him with fire in his eyes. He nods, wants it 
      more than anything. Jamal smiles at his brother. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    Then let s get this shit done. 

      Jamal starts tapping the table to a distinct rhythm that 
      immediately captures Hakeem s attention. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    How about something like...
                          (Starts to rap)
                     All the world gonna see/I m the

                    can stop my fire/Cuz I live high up 
                    on that wire. 

      It sounds great and is very Hakeem.                                                                                     45.

                    It needs something primal to match 
                    that raw shit you got going on. 

      He picks up his guitar and starts playing some music that s *
      raw and visceral. Hakeem stares at his brother in awe. 

                                  HAKEEM
                    You re a genius, you know that? *

                    You lay this down for dad and

                    Will you play on the track?

      Jamal nods as he high fives his grateful brother.  



      Lucious stands in a dark alley surrounded by warehouses with 
      busted windows and graffiti. It s eerily empty. From out of 
      the shadows steps Bunkie, he looks nervous. 

                                    LUCIOUS

                    What are you doing?

                                  BUNKIE

      Bunkie points his gun right at Lucious. 

                                  BUNKIE
                    Stop laughing. 

      Lucious stops laughing, looks a little scared.

                    out, Empire could never public.                                                                                     47.

      Jamal walks out of his loft and sees a large black SUV 
      waiting for him. The window rolls down revealing Cookie 
      sitting in the back seat wearing a NEW white fur. 



      Jamal and Cookie walk around a broken down neighborhood. Some 
      buildings gutted, others with bullet holes. A war zone. On a 
      street corner, YOUNG TEENAGERS are buying and selling drugs.

                                  JAMAL
                    So what happened?

      Cookie gives a devilish grin. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Lucious got me in trouble. 

      CUT TO - ANOTHER BLOCK. They are walking up the street lined 
      with row houses, they look the same as the flashback but a 
      little bit more rundown. Cookie points to the homes.

                                  COOKIE (CONT D)
                    This is where you would ve grown up

                                  JAMAL
                    Didn t we live here?

      Cookie nods, it s very painful for her. The front door opens 
      and out comes Carol, Cookie s sister. She looks almost the 
      same as from the flashback. Carol couldn t be happier.                                                                                    49.


                                  CAROL
                    Cookie!

      She runs over and gives her sister a huge hug. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Hey Aunt Carol.

                    Hey Jamal. Don t just stand there, 
                    come on in. 



      Hakeem s song continues as Lucious stands near the water 
      staring off at the Statue of Liberty. He has an existential 
      sadness, a man who knows his time on Earth is short. 



      Jamal wanders through the Lower East Side, hipster stores 
      intermixed with turn of the century architecture. He looks 
      pensive, unsure. The song comes to an end on his lost gaze. 



      An angry Lucious and Bunkie meet again in the warehouse 
      district. Bunkie is looking at the surveillance photos of him 
      with Shyne. He smirks, doesn t seem to care.*                                                                                    58.


                                  BUNKIE
                    You re a sell out, man. You ve been 
                    selling out for years. You can fool 
                    the President you legit, but I know 
                    your punk ass. 
                          (then)
                    You gonna give me my money?

                                    LUCIOUS
                    No. But I am gonna give you what 
                    you got coming. 

      Bunkie s eyes go wide in fear, he quickly reaches for his 
      gun, but Lucious is MUCH faster as he pulls out a gun and -

      SHOOTS Bunkie right in the head! Bunkie falls to the ground. 
      Lucious shoots him two more times, stares at him for a beat. *
      Then, he turns around and walks away, leaving Bunkie s dead 
      body in a puddle of scum water. 



      Another huge party is taking place on the yacht - hot girls, 
      guys in tank tops, corporate types in suits. The partiers 
      surrounds Lucious who holds a glass of champagne.

                                    LUCIOUS
                    It is a great honor to announce the 
                    return of Cookie Lyon, the heart 
                    and soul of Empire Entertainment. 

      The crowd applauds. Cookie beams. 

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    I never would ve left the streets 
                    of Philly if Cookie hadn t taught 
                    me everything I know. 

      The ship breaks out into applause. Cookie looks directly at 
      Anika. Smiles. Anika smiles back clapping also. She ll never 
      let Cookie see her upset. Cookie s won this round. For now.

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    I also want to announce that in a 
                    year s time, my two sons, Hakeem 
                    and Jamal Lyon will both be 
                    releasing their debut albums. 

      There is more applause. Hakeem and Jamal give each other 
      uncomfortable glances. Lucious holds up his glass of 
      champagne and screams in triumph.                                                                                     59.


                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    To the Empire!

      The crowd screams back: 

                                  CROWD
                    TO THE EMPIRE!

      CUT TO - LATER - ANOTHER PART OF THE SHIP. Jamal is talking 
      to a few people when Hakeem comes over to him. 

                                  HAKEEM
                    Can I talk to you for a sec. 

      They walk away to a private corner. 

                                  HAKEEM (CONT D)
                    I didn t know you were gonna 
                    release an album. 

                                  JAMAL
                    It s news to me too. Cookie had dad 
                    announce it without telling me.  

                                  HAKEEM
                    So it s not true?

                                  JAMAL
                    Maybe it s time. 

      Hakeem gives him a brotherly punch as he smiles. 

                                  HAKEEM
                    It is time. I m here if you need 
                    anything. 

                                  JAMAL
                          (Matter of fact)
                    I m good for now. 

      Hakeem stares at him, knows this is the start of the 
      competition between them. 

                                  HAKEEM
                    Yeah, you always good. See you at 
                    the Grammys nigga. 

      He winks at his brother, then walks away with swagger. Jamal 
      watches him go, a trace of competitiveness seeping into him.  

      Around the corner hiding from view is Rhonda. She heard the 
      whole conversation and looks happier than a pig in shit.                                                                                     60.



      A much younger Lucious waits in a back alley, he looks 
      nervous as he checks his watch. Then, he sees Cookie hurrying 
      across the street with an envelope. She hands it to him.                                                                                       62.


                                    LUCIOUS
                    This all of it?

                                  COOKIE
                    Yeah. 10 large.

      He counts the cash, then notices Cookie looks nervous. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    You okay, baby?

                                  COOKIE
                    I don t know. Something felt off. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    What do you mean?

                                  COOKIE
                    Panther was acting funny, like 
                    something was going down. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    You think the room was bugged?

                                  COOKIE
                    Maybe. Something just felt 
                    different about the drop. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I m sure it was nothing. 

      But Cookie is genuinely scared. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Lucious, listen to me. If something 
                    were to happen to me, if for any 
                    reason I were to go down-- 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    --you re not going down. 

                                  COOKIE
                    But if I had to go in, you gotta 
                    promise me you ll keep playing. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Nothing is gonna happe--

                                  COOKIE
                    --promise you ll keep playing. This 
                    album is gonna be big, I can feel 
                    it. The first one got you some 
                      attention, but this one is the one.                                                                                    63.


      He wraps his arms around his wife. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    You gotta stop worrying. I ll never 
                    let anything happen to you, do you 
                    hear me? 
                          (Then)
                    Nothing s gonna tear my family 
                    apart. 

      He gives his wife a kiss on the lips as we...

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
