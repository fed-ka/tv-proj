      FADE IN:

      EXT. BEACON HILLS PRESERVE/WOODS - NIGHT11

      Under the light of an almost full moon, Scott follows Stiles 
      down a dark path through the woods.

                                  SCOTT
                    Can you at least tell me what we re 
                    doing out here?

                                  STILES
                    When your best friend gets dumped--

                                  SCOTT
                    I didn t get dumped. We re taking a 
                    break.

                                  STILES
                    When your best friend gets told by 
                    his girlfriend that they re taking 
                      a break...          TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/112.

        CONTINUED:11

      Stiles pulls out a bottle of JACK DANIELS from his backpack.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    You get your best friend drunk.

      He holds up the bottle of Jack with a big smile. When he sets 
      it down on a rock... 

      It s HALF EMPTY. No telling how much time has passed, but 
      long enough for Stiles to have gotten completely wasted. The 
      two friends keep warm around a STEEL TRASH CAN with A FIRE 
      BLAZING inside.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Dude, she s one girl. There are 
                    plenty more girls in the sea.

                                  SCOTT
                    Fish in the sea.

                                  STILES
                    What? Why you talking about fish? 
                    I m talking about girls. Especially 
                    ones with strawberry blonde hair, 
                    green eyes, five foot three...

                                  SCOTT
                    Like Lydia?

                                  STILES
                    Exactly. How did you know I was 
                    talking about... What was I talking 
                    about?
                          (eyeing Scott)
                    You don t look happy. Drink.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t want anymore.

                                  STILES
                    You re not drunk?

                                  SCOTT
                    I m not anything.

      Scott stares into the fire, the glow from the flames 
      flickering over his face.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/112A.

                                  STILES
                    Maybe it s like not needing your 
                    inhaler anymore. Maybe you can t 
                    get drunk.
                          (thinking about it)
                    Am I drunk?          TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/113.

        CONTINUED:11

                                  SCOTT
                    You re wasted.

                                  STILES
                    Yeaaahhh.

      He holds his hand out for a fist bump. Gets nothing in 
      return.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Dude, I know it feels bad. But you 
                    gotta  remember. As much as being 
                    broken up hurts... being alone is 
                    even worse. Wait a minute. That 
                    didn t come out right. I need 
                    another drink.

      He reaches for the bottle again, but A HAND grabs it first. 
      Stiles steps back, looking up in surprise at--

      TWO TWENTY-SOMETHINGS. The larger is REDDICK, an unfortunate 
      combination of muscle and antisocial behavior. His friend is 
      a troll named UNGER.

                                    REDDICK
                    Well, look at the little bitches 
                    getting their drink on.

      Stiles steps away as Unger laughs with an obnoxious 
      tittering. Scott keeps his gaze leveled on Reddick.

                                  SCOTT
                    Give it back.

                                    REDDICK
                    What s that, little man?

                                  UNGER
                    I think he wants a drink.

                                  SCOTT
                    I want the bottle.

      Scott doesn t move. Doesn t even blink. Not a trace of fear 
      on him. Unger laughs again.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/113A.

                                  STILES
                    Scott, let s just go.

      Scott s voice has an unnerving calm to it.

                                  SCOTT
                    You brought me here to get me 
                    drunk, Stiles.
                          (still staring at Reddick)
                    I m not drunk yet.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/114.

        CONTINUED:11

      Uneasy, Reddick challenges him by taking a shot. When he 
      lowers the bottle, he eyes Scott with a satisfied smile. But 
      it fades when Scott finally stands. His approach is calm. 
      Deliberate.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Give me the bottle.

      Reddick looks to Unger. But his friend is no longer laughing. 
      Something unnerving about Scott s total calm. Then, as 
      Reddick raises the bottle to take another sip--

      Scott steps closer and his eyes change, BURNING with a sickly 
      YELLOW GLOW.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Give me. The bottle. Of Jack.

      Staring into Scott s yellow eyes, Reddick slowly and shakily 
      holds the bottle out.

      Just a few feet away, Stiles notices Scott s right hand, 
      CLAWS EXTENDED. His fingers tense as if preparing to swipe at 
      Reddick s jugular.

                                  STILES
                    Scott.

      Hand snapping forward, Scott grabs the bottle of Jack out of 
      Reddick s hand and turns, LAUNCHING IT through the air. IT 
      SMASHES against a tree, EXPLODING into a million shards.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      EXT. BEACON HILLS PRESERVE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT22

      Shoes snapping twigs underfoot, Scott heads into the preserve 
      parking lot with Stiles at his heels.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/114aA.

        CONTINUED:22

                                  STILES
                    Please tell me that was because of 
                    the breakup. Or better yet, because 
                      tomorrow s the full moon.

      Scott pauses at the Jeep to help Stiles in to the passenger 
      side. Stiles falls back onto the seat, on the verge of 
      passing out.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Going home now. Yeah?        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/114A.

        CONTINUED:22

      But Scott, keeps a hand on the door. His eyes gazing back to 
      the dark woods where--

      EXT. BEACON HILLS PRESERVE/WOODS - NIGHT2A2A

      Reddick and Unger hurry down a trail.

                                  UNGER
                    How about we just go?

                                    REDDICK
                    How about you just shut up?

      Reddick pauses to light a joint, hunching over to shield the 
      lighter in the wind. But the spark won t catch.

                                  UNGER
                    Come on, dude. I m freezing my junk 
                    off out here.

      Reddick finally gets a FLAME when--SOMETHING YANKS HIM BACK 
      INTO THE DARKNESS.

      As the LIGHTER drops to the ground, a slack-jawed Unger 
      glances up to the blackness in front of him. Breathless, he 
      takes a step back. Then another and another, until he turns 
      and--

      SOMETHING GRABS HIS ANKLE.

      Unger flips forward, face smacking into the dirt. Something 
      DRAGS him back through the woods. He grabs for the ground, 
      fingers slipping over exposed roots, digging at the dirt.

                                  UNGER (CONT D)
                    Help! Help me!

      A dazed Reddick gazes up from the ground to see Unger being 
      dragged past. He reaches for him, grabbing at his wrist. But 
      just as he grabs hold--

      Unger slips through his fingers, dragged back and then LIFTED 
      RIGHT UP OFF THE GROUND.

      Arms flailing as he rises into the air, his body swings 
      about. He tries to grab at branches, but they rip out of his 
      grasp as someone or something carries him back down the 
      trail.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/114AA.

      CONTINUED:2A2A

      Blinking in terror, Unger looks forward in an UPSIDE DOWN 
      VIEW to see where he s being taken--

      Exactly where he came from. To the rocks and to the TRASH CAN 
      where the FIRE still burns.

                                  UNGER (CONT D)
                      No--no--no!

      Coming closer and closer to the trash can, Unger is lifted 
      higher, up and over the flames. Hands pulling back from the 
        incinerating heat, he writhes about, SCREAMING as he tries to 
      struggle free when--

      HE HURTLES DOWN INTO THE FIRE, shoved face first into the 
      flames. The screaming stops. Snuffed out.

      GLOWING EMBERS gently burst up, fluttering into the black 
      night sky above.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      The ALARM CLOCK goes off, RADIO BLARING ON. Underneath the 
      covers, Scott stares at the clock, not moving to turn it off.

      Scott finally gets out of bed, heading for the bathroom.

      He stops at the bathroom door, back to his mother.

                    Not with you.

7A7AINT. HIGH SCHOOL/EXAM ROOM - DAY 

      Scott follows the other students into the exam room. The 
      moment he steps in, however, he spots Allison already seated. 
      She gives him a brief glance, then focuses her eyes down, 
      clearly trying very hard not to look at him. 

      Scott walks between the rows, heading toward her. Moving with 
      determination.

                    Mr. McCall, please take a seat.

      With a nod, he turns away and takes a seat near Stiles while 
      Mr. Harris places a stack of Blue Exam Books at the first 
      desk of each row. The students begin handing them back.

      and excruciating it causes him to flinch--

      A PENCIL ERASER dragging across a sheet of paper with an

      Senses heightened, Scott can t help but focus in on the 
      nervousness around him. He looks back to the test.

      The next question: Why would a girl that pretty go out with a 
      loser like you?

      Scott gazes at the question, eyes blinking. Then looks over 
      to Allison who is busily filling in her own test.

      When Scott turns back the question on his sheet has changed 
      to: Which one of the following statements about price 
      mechanism is correct?

      Rubbing his eyes with his fingers, he marks down the answer 
      with his pen. Then looks at the next question:

      When the moon is full tonight will you kill: A: All of your 
      friends? B: Some of your friends? C: Most of your friends? 

      Scott slams his pencil back down on the desk, squeezing his 
      eyes shut. But with his eyelids closed, his heightened 
      HEARING begins to pick up the HEARTBEATS around him. 

      As the thumping becomes louder and louder, a CELL PHONE 
      VIBRATES on a desk. Someone pulls their chair forward, METAL 
      SCRAPING over the floor--

      Scott darts up from his seat, grabbing his bag.

      Stiles steps into the locker room, the RING NOW LOUDER. When 
      it stops, he listens in. One of the SHOWERS is on.

      Scott s jacket and shirt lie on the floor. Stiles slowly 
      steps past them and further into the locker room to find 
      Scott kneeling underneath one of the showers, water spraying 
      onto his torso.

      His back rises with each troubled breath. He slowly looks up 
      at Stiles.

                    No... I can t... I can t breathe.

      Watching him struggle with each gasp, Stiles quickly drops 
      Scott s bag to the floor, unzips it and begins rifling 
      inside. Finding the item he s looking for, he turns back to 
      Scott who has crawled out from the spray of water to lean 
      against the tile wall.

                    I just need to ask you something.

      She steps closer, waiting as Scott struggles with the words.*

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Does Allison still like me?

      Her step closer becomes a step back. She takes an audible and 
        disappointed breath.

                                  LYDIA
                    Of course, she still likes you.

                                  SCOTT
                    Really?

                                  LYDIA
                    She ll always like you. As friends. 
                    Just friends.

                                  SCOTT
                    Just friends.

      Lydia nods. Scott puts a shaky hand on the underside of the 
      bleachers. Almost as if he needs to hold himself up.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1124.

                    If you ask me--and of course, no 
                    one asks me--she made a big 
                    mistake. I m talking lifetime 
                    regret. Ask me how I know that.

                                  SCOTT
                    How?

                                  LYDIA
                    Because I know you locked us in 
                    there to protect us. Because I know 
                    that when a guy risks his life for 
                    you, you should be grateful.

      Scott lifts his eyes to hers, a new and distinctly sinister 
      quality to his gaze. His lower teeth just visible between his 
      lips, it s an animal-like expression.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you grateful?

      He slides his hand off the bench, coming closer.

                                  LYDIA
                    I think you d be pretty surprised 
                    at just how grateful I am. To be 
                    honest, Scott...

      Her hand comes up, brushing against his shirt, fingers 
      lightly touching his chest.

                    I have so much gratitude, I m not 
                    sure how to express all of it.

      Her lips come close to his as her voice turns to a whisper.*

                    But I could try...

      Lydia kisses him. His mouth opens to hers, as she rakes *
      fingers down his chest. He gropes back at her, pulling her *
      into him, hands clawing at her. There s nothing sensual about 
      it.         TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1125.

      Almost like he could go from kissing her to tearing out her 
      throat without even blinking.

      BACK ON THE FIELD - Stiles nervously chews at the laces on 
      his lacrosse stick. He whirls around when Scott comes walking 
      back to join the practice.

                                  STILES
                    Hey. What happened?

      Scott turns back, Stiles s request seemingly forgotten.

                    say she liked me? Imply she liked *

                    she s totally into you.

      As Scott turns away, an elated Stiles never notices the ever 
      darkening expression falling over his best friend s face.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - DAY1616

      Coach blows the WHISTLE sending the first OFFENSIVE PLAYER 
      into a drill. Scott and Stiles wait in line for their turn.

                                  STILES
                    Are you okay, dude?

      Scott doesn t answer, gloves twisting around his stick.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    I know we had good news and all 
                    that, but it s seven hours left 
                    till the full moon--

      The WHISTLE blows for the next play. Scott s turn.

      Coach tosses the ball and Scott goes for it. Moving fast, 
      twisting his stick to keep the ball in tight--

      TWO PLAYERS COLLIDE with Scott, ramming into him with 
      unwarranted brutality. He tumbles to the ground, stick 
      clattering away from him.

                                  COACH
                          (laughing)
                    I guess some people don t 
                      appreciate your new status, McCall.

      Behind the lineup of other players, Stiles looks out to see 
      Scott snap right back up to his feet in an acrobatic kip up.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Next!

      But before another player can step forward, Scott whips his 
      lacrosse stick in front of him. Teeth bared underneath his 
      helmet, he steps to the head of the line again.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    That s the spirit. Earn it, McCall! 
                    Earn it!

      He sends the ball bouncing to the ground. Scott grabs it and 
      shoots forward at the TWO LONG STICK DEFENDERS. He smashes 
      through them like a BATTERING RAM.

      Playing goal, Danny comes forward to stop the offensive 
      attack but--        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1127.

      Scott whips around and shoves his elbow into Danny s helmet, 
      sending him TUMBLING THROUGH THE AIR.

      Danny goes down with a strangled cry of PAIN. He hits the 
      ground hard, helmet snapping into the dirt.

      Coach BLOWS the whistle as other players start forward. 
      Jackson shoves past everyone, alarmed for his friend.

      AT THE BLEACHERS - Lydia stands up.

                                  LYDIA
                    Was that Danny?

      Stepping down, she hurries ONTO THE FIELD where Stiles pulls 
      Scott away from the gathering crowd.

                                  STILES
                    What the hell s wrong with you? You *
                    just took Danny down.

                                  SCOTT
                    So what? He s twice the size of me.*

                                  STILES
                    So everyone likes Danny. Which *
                    means everyone s going to hate you.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t care.

      They turn back to see Danny slowly sitting up as an EMT 
      rushes in. The cracked front plate of his helmet is removed 
      to reveal BLOOD running out of his nose.

      Scott s head snaps back as he takes in the scent of BLOOD. 
      The corners of his lips curl upward in a smile that s more 
      than slightly evil.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                          (noticing Stiles s look)
                    What?

      He shoves past, heading for the school. Stiles turns his 
      attention back to the crowd around Danny.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1128.

      Whipping out a compact she glances at the reflection to see 
      her lipstick slightly smeared.

                                  LYDIA
                    Oh. Wonder how that happened.

      Jackson watches her fix the smear with her thumb.

                    Okay. Well, let s get this set up. 
                    Check out what I bought...

      He hauls the bag up onto the bed. But Scott doesn t move to 
      look. Doesn t even blink.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m fine, Stiles. I m just going to 
                    lock the door. Go to sleep early.

                                  STILES
                    You sure about that? Because you ve 
                    got this serial killer look going 
                    on. And I m hoping it s just the

                    it s starting to freak me out.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m fine. You should go now.

                                  STILES
                    All right, I ll leave. If you take 
                    a look in the bag and let me show 
                    you what I bought and maybe you use 
                    it and maybe you don t. Sound good?

      Scott stares at him. Then finally, he goes to the bed and 
      unzips the bag. Inside are lengths of CHAIN.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1133.

                      Actually... no.

      And Stiles yanks something out of his jacket pocket. He moves 
      fast as Scott turns in surprise. But he reacts too late.

      With a CLICK Stiles locks one end of a pair of HANDCUFFS 
      around Scott s wrist and then hauls him down to the floor to 
      latch the other end to the RADIATOR by his bed.

      Scott lashes out as Stiles scrambles back.

      Allison walks the aisle of a small sports store, eyes 
      wandering the shelves until she finds what she s looking 
      for... THE ARCHERY SECTION.

      While checking the price on one of the fiber optic sights, 
      she glances up to notice someone on the opposite side of the 
      shelf smiling at her.

                    Why do I get the feeling you could

                    Maybe because I m kind of feeling 
                    the same way.

      Stiles comes back into Scott s room to find him still 
      struggling against the handcuffs. Stiles holds up an uncapped 
      BOTTLE OF WATER.

      As Stiles steps out of the bedroom, the dog bowl FLIPS into

      Stiles pauses at the threshold, trying to resist the urge. 
      But then he whirls back, anger pouring out of him.

      On top of the car, Scott reaches up with a clawed hand to 
      strike down and--

      SOMETHING FLIES OUT OF THE DARKNESS toppling him to the 
      ground.

      The shadowy figure flips forward, landing on his feet. It s 
      Derek. In werewolf form, baring his fangs at Scott. And very 
      much alive...

      INT. JACKSON S CAR - NIGHT3838

      Jackson and Allison spin around, trying to see through the 
      fogged up windows.

                                    ALLISON
                    What was that?*

      Allison reaches for the door--

                                    JACKSON
                    Don t!*

      He pulls her back, clearly more frightened than she is.*

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT3939

      Tumbling through foliage, Scott tries to fight Derek off, but 
      the older werewolf is far more powerful. He pounds him back 
      into the woods, dragging him into the shadows.

                                  DEREK
                    Scott--

      But the boy still thrashes out, trying to fight him off.

      CONTINUED:3939

      Derek pushes down on him and SNARLS with an unbridled 
      ferocity. Then, in the blink of an eye, he s human again. 
      Scott gazes at him as if not recognizing him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek? You re alive.*

      Then he sees his hands. The claws. The realization of what *
      he s done falls over him.*

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    What s happening to me?

                                  DEREK*
                    Exactly what he wants to happen.

      INT. STILES S JEEP - NIGHT4040

      Stiles tears around the corner and SLAMS on the brakes. He 
      spots several SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CARS parked next to 
      an AMBULANCE just by the side of the road.

                                  STILES
                    No... no...

      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT4141

      Jumping out of his jeep, Stiles frantically searches for his 
      dad amongst the officers.

                                  STILES
                    Hey, where s my Dad? Sheriff 
                      Stilinski? Where s the Sheriff? 
                    Where s Stilinski?

      But then a GURNEY is rolled out of the woods. Stiles looks on 
      it, terrified. He rushes forward as voices shout for him to 
      stop. When he gets to the gurney, the body he sees--

      Is not his father. It s Unger. The twenty-something with 
      Reddick who grabbed their bottle of Jack when Stiles was 
      trying to get Scott drunk.

      His body is BURNED, a HORRIBLY CHARRED CORPSE.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Stiles?

      He whirls around to find his father coming out of the dark of 
      the woods.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1142.

                    What the hell are you doing out 
                    here?

      But Stiles can t answer. He just crumbles into his father s 
      arms, near tears and utterly beaten by the day. No idea what 
      to say or what his son s been through, Stilinski simply hugs 
      him back.

      Neither of them notice the SUV pulling up nearby.

      INT. ARGENT S CAR - NIGHT41A41A

      Argent peers out from behind the wheel, Kate riding shotgun.

                    you came across the two Betas? One *
                    of them was smaller, right? Was he 
                    just smaller? Or could he have been 
                    younger too?

                                  ARGENT
                    You have an idea who it might be?

                    I m working on a theory.

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT41B41B

      Derek helps an exhausted Scott to his bed. The room is a 
      disaster from his temporary imprisonment.

                                  SCOTT
                    Wait.

      Derek looks back from the door.

                    I can t do this. I can t be this

                    For someone who was bitten? I ve

                    Kill the Alpha.

      His head falls at the weight of the task. But Derek steps 
      forward again, peering down at him.

                                  DEREK
                    You help me find him, Scott? And 
                    I ll help you kill him.

      Outside Scott s open window, the full moon still burns 
      brightly in the sky...

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT41C41C

      And underneath that moon, somewhere high up on a the rocky 
      face of a steep hill, the Alpha kneels down. Moonlight 
      washing over its muscular and hulking body--

      The creature TRANSFORMS. Rapidly shifting back, its monstrous 
      features reverting back into the naked torso of a man.

      An ordinary man.

      INT. WHITTEMORE HOME/GARAGE - NIGHT4242

      A shaky and bewildered Jackson pulls his car into the garage 
      and gets out. But as he s closing the driver s side door, he 
      pauses...

      He spots something under the light. Something on his car... 
      He goes over to it and examines the rear windshield. 
      Something is stuck between where the glass and the roof meet.

      He plucks it out and raises it to the light.

      It s a CLAW...

      A LIGHT clicks on under a worktable. Jackson places the claw 
      down under the soft glow.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1144.

      Next to it, he places a LACROSSE GLOVE he picked up on the 
      field after the end of the first game. The name written in 
      bold black letters on it: MCCALL.

      Jackson pauses, as if deciding whether he actually wants to 
      make the connection. But then he picks up the glove in one 
      hand, the claw in the other, and slowly brings them together.

      Just as the claw is about to fit into one of the fingertip 
        perforations we--
