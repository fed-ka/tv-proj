    CAMERA RIPS down the Strip.  Favoring shots of LIGHTS.  The
    GLARE.  THE FLASH.  The VOLUME.  The SEXY.  We find our way
  to the flickering "WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS" SIGN.  

    CRUISE from it, across the DESERT, over RESIDENTIAL TRACTS
  and GOLF COURSES.  Then THROUGH an ADOBE WALL, into --



    A GATED COMMUNITY.  We land on a SIGN: "Forest Green
    Sustainable Community: Life. Simply Put."  Then SLIDE across
  it to FIND an old CADILLAC parked in front of a house.  



  Crime scene.  Sprinklers off, but WATERY BLOOD is puddled
    everywhere.  CATHERINE swabs poor Alison, still freaked.  

                                    ALISON

                                    CATHERINE
                Not so friendly tonight.

    Catherine is eyeing BRASS exiting the house with UNIS.  Their
  faces say all the blood is coming from inside.

  -- AND DIVES into the grass, FINDING one BLOOD DROPLET, then
    ANOTHER, and ANOTHER.  WE CAREEN through the grass, leap-
    frogging from drop to drop, as the CSIs' lights find them. 

  WHIP PAN UP FROM THE GRASS TO FIND Russell, Catherine, Brass
  and UNIs charging AT CAMERA, away from the Chambliss house.



    CAMERA TRACKS FAST WITH Russell, Catherine, Brass and UNIs
  as they find drops, on the grass, in the dirt.  On the street. *
  One, then another, arriving at the end of the blood trail...*  CSI: "Tell-Tale Hearts" - 1202 - WHITE - 8/1/116.



  Front door ajar.  BLOOD SMEAR on the DOOR FRAME.  Russell
  and Catherine arrive a step before Brass and the UNIs.

                                  BRASS
                I got this.  Don't move 'til you
                get a Code Four.

  Brass draws his gun, enters with UNIs, as...

    Russell and Catherine wait outside.  Tense moments as they
  hear from inside the house: "Clear!  Clear!  Clear!"  Then...

    VOICES OF BRASS AND THE UNIs SHOUTING: "Show me your hands!
    I said, show me your hands!"  Russell eyes Catherine --

                                    RUSSELL
                  Sounds like a Code Four to me.

  He pushes inside, and Catherine follows.



  Off the grid.  Housing boom gone bust.  Roads not even
    finished.  A FENDER and TIRE ENTER FRAME, jerk to a stop --

                  When you can safely do so, make a U-
                  turn at the next intersection.



  The Denali screams forward... jumping the curb... four
    wheeling it in a cloud of dust.  Across dirt, rocks, sagebrush --

                You are going the wrong way.  You
                are going the wrong way.



  NICK unloads his gear from the back of his Denali.  In the
    distance, he squints at a curious DUST DEVIL approaching
  fast.  What is it?

  From the dust emerges MORGAN'S DENALI, careening off the
  dirt, launching over the curb and slamming onto the paved
    street... screeching to a stop a little too close to Nick.  

    A smiling Morgan hops out and approaches, as we HEAR --

  walks up, as Morgan loads extra EVIDENCE TENTS into her kit.

  As Ecklie looks at Morgan, they both have stuff to do --  CSI: "Tell-Tale Hearts" - 1202 - WHITE - 8/1/119.



    FLASH!  FLASH!  Morgan documents the BASE OF THE BIRD BATH. 
  On its side, basin missing -- we know where it ended up.  As
    Morgan visualizes the bird bath's original position --


25CSI SHOT - BASE OF THE BIRD BATH 25

  It RISES OFF the ground, the BASIN GHOSTS back in.  Morgan
  steps toward the GHOST BIRD BATH. Takes a beat to analyze,
  then crouches down behind it, looking PAST it, TO --

    Fiona's bed.  Perfectly framed in the BROKEN WINDOW. 

    Morgan looks down. In the dirt, just behind the GHOST BIRD
  BATH, she sees OVERLAPPING BOOT PRINTS. 

  She puts her cheek to the dirt, blows on the prints.  Very
    little dirt blows away.  Means the boot prints are BAKED IN.  CSI: "Tell-Tale Hearts" - 1202 - WHITE - 8/1/1111.

  of carpet just inside the room.  A bloody boot print.*
