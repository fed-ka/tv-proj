      The plane SCREAMS towards camera, takes off, the wheels 
        passing just overhead.

                                        ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                      I started to panic when I reread it on 
                      the plane.



        Moving past the skyline to the hotel.  Helicopter shot 
        swoops up, up, in a dizzying flight to the balcony suite 
      on the 30th floor.



        Elizabeth comes out, dressed to kill in an outfit way too 
        trendy/sexual for a gathering of neuroscientists.                                                                                          5.


      As she gets in the limo, the driver, KASSIM, a muscular 
      young Middle Eastern man in a tight shirt, holds the 
      door.  Her skirt hikes as she slides into the back seat.  
      He watches, then his look then moves up and meets her 
      smile as we hear:

                                        MALE (V.O.)
                      I am honored tonight to introduce
                      the director of the highly acclaimed 
                        Neuroscience Research and Treatment 
                      Centre at USFD.



        Elizabeth is superwoman, soaring far above the lights 
      along the harbor, doing barrel rolls like an F-16 fighter 
        pilot.  Stars streak by.  The Milky Way spins overhead.  

      CU ELIZABETH, crying tears of joy.  Then lightning 
        flashes.  Something wet hits her cheek.  Rain.  The world 
      goes dark and cold.  The stars disappear.  

      And now she s falling like a stone.  The harbor lights 
      blur as she drops towards the earth, hurtling towards the 
        pavement. She opens her mouth to scream and-



        Elizabeth is back in the real world, balancing on the 
        railing of the hotel balcony 30 floors up in her silk 
        underwear in the rain. Inches from death.  She wobbles, 
        nearly falls, barely catches herself, drops back to the 
        safety of the balcony where she edges back, curls into a 
      fetal position.  For the first time, scared.



      The Center for Neurological Research and Treatment, aka 
       The Cube  is a square structure made of smoky black 
        glass, attached by walkway to an older University 
        hospital.  The hospital is staid, ordinary, plain. The 
      cube is modern.  Elegant.  Impenetrable.



        Elizabeth enters the inner city brick building as we 
      hear:

                                        KIDS CHANTING (V.O.)
                      Radius is half across the circle. 
                      Diameter is all.



        A fancy private school outside Boston.  The scene is as 
        different from the previous one as it could be.  The 
        varsity girl s soccer team is fighting a close game.  
        Well-to-do parents from opposing teams line both sides. 
      The field is lit with kleig lights.  An ironic group of 
      white guys pretend to be cheerleaders, chant:

                                        CHEERLEADERS
                      Mirror, mirror on my locker
                      Pretty girls don't play soccer
                      Lets get ugly!!! Go Team!

      One young Apollo, DARIUS NEGROPONTE, calls to ESME BLACK, 
      15, a raven haired beauty with a strong resemblance to 
        Elizabeth, as she moves the ball down field.

                                        DARIUS
                      B-u-s-t, bust em. That s your custom!  Go 
                      Esme!

      Esme flips Darius a bird and a smile without missing a 
        stride. He laughs.

        A tight lipped, 43-year-old mother putting out half-time 
        refreshment sees it all and frowns.  This is REGAN BLACK, 
        Esme s mother.

        Elizabeth and Will stand near the goal with her brother, 
        JOSHUA BLACK, 40. Joshua is a thin, bearded, slightly 
        scruffy guy who looks out of place in a sea of yuppies. 
      He s sneaking a cigarette.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Don t let Regan catch you.                                                                                        20.


                                        JOSHUA
                      She s too busy being the food Nazi Mom. 
                      Wait till the team gets a load of her 
                      gluten-free arugula sandwiches.

        Elizabeth grimaces, then puts her fingers in her mouth 
      and whistles encouragement as Esme passes.  Will shouts.

                                        WILL
                      Take it home, Esme!

      Esme, hearing Will, shoots him a grin and goes into hyper 
        drive.  She takes off, dark hair flying, long legs eating 
      up the field, drills the ball around several defenders 
      and slams home a goal.  Will, Elizabeth and Joshua go 
      nuts.  

      The team leaps into high fives, then jog towards 
        refreshments.  Esme and one of her friends, a muscled, 
        Viking girl, JOHANNA, arrive first.

                                        JOHANNA
                      I m starving.  Haven t eaten since I 
                      barfed up my lunch.

      Esme grabs Fuji water.  Johanna takes a bite of sandwich 
      and spits it out.

                                        JOHANNA (CONT D)
                      What the hell?  Tastes like cow dung on 
                      cardboard!

      CASH, a feisty redhead, calls out.

                                        CASH
                      Heads up. Esme s mom made snacks!

      The team groans, turns away from the trays of food.  They 
        wander off to greet their parents.  Esme spins on Regan.

                                        ESME
                      I told you they want soda and chips!  Are 
                      you trying to embarrass me?

                                        REGAN
                    Me embarrass you?  I saw you use an
                      obscene gesture right in front of
                      the dean of students!

                                        ESME
                         Congratulations Esme! I m so proud of 
                      you.  You scored the winning goal!                                                                                         21.


      Esme tosses down the water bottle, huffs off as Joshua 
        approaches.  Regan turns on him.

                                        REGAN
                      How can you let her talk to me that way?  
                                (without missing a beat)
                      You ve been smoking.

        Meanwhile, Elizabeth finds Esme, circles her waist, lifts 
      her off the ground.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      You were awesome!  You totally brought 
                      it.

                                        ESME
                      Help me, Auntie Liz.  Mom is psycho.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      No.  She s a great mom who is just doing 
                      her job.

      Will has the soccer ball and starts goofing with it.

                                        WILL
                      Esme!  Over here.

      Esme joins him and they pass it back and forth.  Joshua 
        crosses to Elizabeth.

                                        JOSHUA
                      Marry that guy.  He s the best.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Funny you should bring up the m word.  
                      Will proposed.

                                        JOSHUA
                      What?  This is huge.  Congratulations!

      He hugs her.  She pushes away gently.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Chill.  I m going to say no.

                                        JOSHUA
                      What?!  Why?   

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Because, Joshua, he s clueless about me. 
                    He thinks I m normal.                                                                                        22.


                                        JOSHUA
                                (incredulous)
                      Why haven t you told him?  Liz!  It s 
                      been a year!  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I don t want to lose him.

                                         JOSHUA
                    He can handle it.   
                                (after a moment)
                      All men aren t like Esme s dad.

        Elizabeth reacts, glances around to make sure no one 
        heard, says firmly.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      You re Esme s dad.

                                        JOSHUA
                                (cocks an eyebrow)
                      Not going to tell him that, either?

      Esme comes running back and they fall silent.

                                        ESME
                      Come home with us for dinner, Auntie Liz? 
                      Pretty please?

                                        REGAN
                                (approaching)
                      Not on a school night.

      The tension between Regan and Elizabeth is apparent and 
        Elizabeth is not the one generating it.  As always, she 
        avoids throwing kerosene on the fire.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Your mom s right.  Great game, kiddo.

        Elizabeth hugs Esme briefly, then smiles a full, generous 
      smile at Regan as Will approaches.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      Couldn t come anyway, I ve got a hot 
                      date.



        Elizabeth gets out of Will s car.  He gets out, too, but 
      keeps a distance between them.  She turns to him, her 
      eyes clear.  Her voice quiet.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      This is the end.  I understand that.  And 
                    it should be.  Find someone nice, 
                      darling.  Someone normal.  I love you too 
                      much to do this to you.   

      She walks off.  He watches.  And he doesn t follow.  He 
      gets back in the car, drives off.

      CLOSE ON ELIZABETH.....She turns and watches him drive 
      away.   

      Then the entire street MORPHS into a different place. A 
        different hospital.  And Elizabeth is suddenly 18 and 
        pregnant, standing outside the ER door.  She screams at 
        another car as it pulls away.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      No, Johnny!  Come back.  Don t leave me!  

      The car disappears into the night.  She s left sobbing, 
        alone.  She doubles over with labor pains.    

      BACK TO....

        Elizabeth present day. Composed.  No longer capable of 
      that kind of meltdown.  She squares her shoulders and 
      walks inside, taking refuge where she always takes 
        refuge.  With her patients.  Her medical life.



        Elizabeth gets out of her car, crosses to Will who waits 
      with a realtor, JODY FINE. They are standing in front of 
        a lovely family home with a two car garage and a white 
        picket fence. Elizabeth slows as she approaches. We see 
        something like fear in her face.  Will turns and she 
        forces a smile.

                                        WILL
                      What do you think?

                                        ELIZABETH
                    It has a white picket fence.

                                        WILL
                      Keep breathing. And keep an open mind.

                                        JODY
                      Hi, I m Jody Fine. I just started working 
                      with Will and this place popped up on the 
                      market. I really think you re going to 
                      love it.  Wait till you see the inside. 
                      And, here s the best part, there s a 
                      playground in walking distance and the 
                      school district is first rate.
                                (bright smile)
                      You couldn t find a better neighborhood 
                      for starting a family.

        Elizabeth shoots Will a panicked look, whispers.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I told you I don t want kids.

                                        WILL
                      Someday you may change your mind.



        Elizabeth is parked looking out at the ocean. It s cold 
      and foggy. Quiet. Peaceful. This is a place she often 
      comes to think.  She looks down at the engagement ring on 
      her hand, seems troubled.  Tries to slip it off.  Can t. 
      It s too tight on her finger.                                                                                         37.


      She looks up. There s a woman walking on the beach. She 
      is wearing some kind of fur coat.  What the hell? 
        Elizabeth blinks and the vision is gone.  Is there really 
        someone there or were her eyes deceiving her?  

      She tries to open the car door.  It s locked.  She can t 
      get out. She struggles, slams her fist against the 
        window, getting increasingly panicked.    

      Then she stops.  She tries to breathe evenly, control her 
        anger. It works. She hits the right switch.  Gets out 
      with no problem.

      No sign of a woman in a fur coat. Elizabeth slips off her 
        shoes, walks towards the water.

      But then she SINKS up to her knees as if in quicksand! 
      She fights back and finally pulls her leg out.  Confused, 
      she backs away, then hears:

                                        O.S. WOMAN
                      Help!

        Elizabeth turns. There is a dark head just visible above 
      the waves!  Someone is in the water!  As Elizabeth 
        watches, the person goes under.  Elizabeth looks around. 
        There s no one else on the beach.

        A hand comes up, thrashes, and disappears again.  
        Elizabeth doesn t hesitate.  She runs to the water and 
      dives in, swims out, then down.

        Underwater.  Elizabeth goes deeper, deeper.  Finally she 
      sees streaming dark hair.  It s the woman in the coat, 
        sinking fast.  Elizabeth reaches out.  Gets closer. 
        Reaches out more.  Grabs the edge of the coat.  The 
        weight begins to pull her down, too!

      She kicks frantically, unwilling to drown to save this 
        person. She lets go of the coat and the drowning woman 
        reaches up and grabs her!  They ll die together.  The 
      woman is pulling her down.  She can t get away.

        Elizabeth opens her mouth to scream but nothing comes out 
        underwater.  At the same time she sees the woman who has 
      her in a death grip. It s her own face looking back at 
      her.


        Elizabeth pulls out in her Audi.  Going fast.



        Elizabeth s car passes everything in sight.



        Historic brick buildings overlooking a river.  Tasteful.  
        Elizabeth s car roars up, jumps the curb and parks with 
      one tire off the street.     



      Under a full moon.  Elizabeth runs.  And runs.  And runs.



      Still going, covered with sweat, she enters a subway 
        station.



        Joshua struggles with Elizabeth, trying to get her into 
      his car.

                                        JOSHUA
                      Elizabeth, you have to come with me.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I don t have to do jack!  I am the mother 
                      suckin  shore patrol, mother sucker.  
                      Watch.  I have magical powers.  I can 
                      stop cars!

      She runs into traffic.  Tires screech.  Joshua dials 911.



        A very different place than the one where she works.  Not 
      nice.



        Elizabeth knocks at the front door.  Regan opens.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I came to apologize, to you and to Esme.

      Regan steps outside with Elizabeth, closes the door 
        behind her.  Not good.                                                                                        51.


                                        REGAN
                      Esme s fine.  She s used to this.  How 
                      does that make you feel?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Worse than you can ever imagine.  Can I 
                      see her?  

                                        REGAN
                      No.  You and Esme are going to take a 
                      break.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Please, Regan.  I ll do anything.  Don t 
                      take Esme away from me.

                                        REGAN
                      It s all about you all the time.  God, 
                      you re exhausting.  And the worst of it 
                      is, she still loves you.  More than me.  
                      You can t have missed the way she s been 
                      treating me.   

                                        ELIZABETH
                      She s a teenager.  It s normal.

                                        REGAN
                      No, it s not.  She s transferring the 
                      affection she always had for me to you.  
                      I m the boring housewife who waits on her 
                      hand and foot.  You re her exotic, 
                      successful, crazy aunt who does exactly 
                      what she pleases, no matter who she 
                      hurts, and always gets away with it.  Not 
                      this time.

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (suddenly desperate)
                      Please, Regan.  I have to see her.  She s 
                      all I ve got.

                                        REGAN
                      Not until she realizes who her real 
                      family is.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I am her real family.

                                        REGAN
                      Say that one more time and you ll never 
                      see her again.  You made a deal.  You 
                      know perfectly well I hold the cards.  
                      This is my decision.  So learn to live 
                      with it.                                                                                         52.


        Instantly, Elizabeth regrets her words.  But it s too 
      late.  Regan goes inside and locks the door.  Elizabeth 
      leans on the doorbell.  Nothing.  Starts to 
        hyperventilate.  She returns to her car and looks up at 
      the house.

      Esme stands her upstairs window like a princess in a 
        tower.  She waves once to Elizabeth and disappears.



        Elizabeth sits in her car, looking out at the water.  
      It s the same place we saw in her dream.  A real place.  
      It may, in fact, be where her mother died.  Elizabeth 
      pulls out her cell phone and dials.  



        Establishing.  A board and care van is by the front door.



        Elizabeth sits on a bench having take out lunch.  Will 
      slips into frame and sits beside her.  She looks over, 
        surprised to see him.  Doesn t know what to say.  

                                        WILL
                      I should have called. 

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (casual)
                      It s okay.  I understand.                                                                                           56.


                                        WILL
                      You were a stranger.  A creature.  Not 
                      the woman I thought I knew.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      You don t have to explain.  You re a 
                      kind, intelligent, normal guy. Why should 
                      put up with this?  

      She gets up to go and he reaches out and grabs her hand.  

                                        WILL
                      Maybe I m not as  normal  as you think.  
                      What you did to me.  That night?  
                                (beat)
                      I liked it.  And I want to do it again.

        Elizabeth doesn t know what to say.  Hold on the two of 
      them as we....

      FADE OUT.
