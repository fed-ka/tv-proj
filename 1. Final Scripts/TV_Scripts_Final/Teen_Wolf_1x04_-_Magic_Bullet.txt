                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT11

      Dark. Quiet. Empty. Until the sound of a CAR ENGINE RUMBLES 
      in and a PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS appear on the horizon.

      INT. CAR - NIGHT22

      A DEEJAY talks rapid fire on the radio.

                                  DEEJAY (V.O.)
                    In other news local authorities 
                    remain perplexed by the animal 
                    attacks plaguing Beacon Hills--

      KATE, the beautiful twenty-something driving, clicks to 
      another station. MUSIC BLASTING through the speakers, she 
      drums the wheel to the beat as--

      A LIGHT THUMP catches her attention. She puts her foot on the 
      brake and slows to a stop in the road. Turning off the radio, 
      she glances in the rear view mirror.

      The road behind her lies empty. Nothing at all.

      Kate cranks the radio again and hits the gas. But an unease 
      has crept over her. And with good reason... 

      THROUGH THE REAR WINDSHIELD BEHIND HER - TWO GLOWING RED EYES 
      appear in the darkness.

      While Kate nods her head to the music, those RED EYES surge 
      ever closer, approaching as if to attack. But instead they 
      disappear into the shadows like lights clicking off.

      THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW - Trees flit by, deep woods 
      flanking the right side of the car where--

      THE RED EYES appear again. A dark shape keeping pace with the 
      vehicle. As if sensing something watching her, Kate glances 
      out the window. Almost in the same instant, the eyes vanish 
      again.

      Kate s gaze lingers too long. She doesn t see she s coming up 
      too fast on a RED LIGHT. Finally turning to look, she SLAMS 
      on the brakes, SCREAMING to a stop.          TEEN WOLF EP#104 "EPISODE 104" BUFF DRAFT11/17/102.

        CONTINUED:22

                                  KATE
                    Nice, Kate. Nice driving.

      She snaps the radio off, then waits in silence for the light 
      to change. The seconds tick by. She nervously taps a finger 
      on the wheel, eyes glancing about.

      Finally, the light changes to GREEN. Kate starts to lift her 
      foot off the brake when--

      A LOUD THUMP ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR startles her. Her eyes go 
      up as she sucks in a breath. But no other sound follows while 
      her gaze wanders down from the roof to--

      THE PASSENGER WINDOW - where inky black shapes move among the 
      dark woods. Impossible to tell if it s just trees and foliage 
      in the shadows. Or something else...

      Kate leans closer to the passenger window, squinting to see 
      if something is out there while behind her--

      THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDOW EXPLODES INTO THE CAR.

      Kate SCREAMS as a CLAWED HAND GRABS AT HER from the roof. 
      Digging into her jacket, it drags her up toward the shattered 
      window as she struggles against it--

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    No, no--

      Her hand reaches behind her seat, fingers grasping at 
      something as the Alpha tries to pull her out. Kate finally 
      grabs the object--

      A MOSSBERG PISTOL GRIP SHOTGUN. 

      She whips it up and pulls the trigger, BLASTING A HOLE 
      through the roof of her car.

      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT33

      The passenger door of the car SLAMS open. Kate rolls out to a 
      crouched stance, shotgun primed. The move is fluid and fast. 
      Kate is no ordinary young woman-- 

      She s a HUNTER.

      But there s nothing on the roof of the car now. No sign of 
      movement. Kate spins, shotgun aimed. 

                                  KATE
                    Come on...           TEEN WOLF EP#104 "EPISODE 104" BUFF DRAFT11/17/103.

        CONTINUED:33

      She raises the shotgun and FIRES a shot into the sky.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    COME ON!

                                                                            CUT TO:
      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

44INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT 

      Scott lies awake under the covers. Unable to sleep, tossing 
      and turning when-- 

      BOOM.

      He bolts upright. The sound is like a thunderclap in the 
      distance. Turning to the window by his bed, he listens. Then 
      just as he s about to lie back down again--

      BOOM. 

      This time, with his hearing attuned, the sound is far more 
      distinct. It s a SHOTGUN BLAST. Scrambling out of bed, Scott 
      grabs the nearest pair of jeans as--

      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT55

      Crunching broken glass beneath her shoes, Kate tosses her 
      shotgun inside the trunk of her semi-destroyed car. 

      From a BLACK BAG, she produces a RIFLE WITH A SCOPE and loads 
      it with BULLETS FROM A BLUE STEEL CASE.

      Then, with the weapon slung over her shoulder, she clicks on 
      a MAGLITE. Sweeping the beam over the pavement, she finds--

      DROPS OF BLOOD.

      Kate pulls her phone out and starts thumbing a text.

66INT. ARGENT HOME/FOYER - NIGHT 

      Charging out from the hall with a dark bag, Argent hurries 
      for the front door.

                                    ALLISON
                    What s going on?

      Allison looks down from the second floor stairs.

                                  ARGENT
                    Your aunt, Kate, just texted. I m 
                    heading out to pick her up.           TEEN WOLF EP#104 "EPISODE 104" BUFF DRAFT11/17/104.

                                  ARGENT
                    Yeah. She s just having a little 
                    car trouble.

                                  ALLISON*
                    Not serious, is it?*

                                    ARGENT*
                    No. Just a flat.*

      EXT. DARK ALLEYWAY - NIGHT77

      WOLF POV - Moving at breakneck speed behind a series of 
      industrial buildings. Hugging corners. Jumping atop a large 
      dumpster. Then up onto...

      EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING/ROOF - NIGHT88

      The rooftop. Derek, in human form and the source of the POV, 
      kneels down to inspect BLOOD in the loose gravel. Movement 
      catches his eye--

      A DARK SILHOUETTE just ahead. The Alpha pauses to turn its 
      RED EYES toward Derek. But only for a moment. The black shape 
      spins and charges off.

      Derek launches himself up, running after it. Picking up 
      speed, he LEAPS from the edge of the roof across the 
      alleyway, gliding through the air as--

      BANG! GUNFIRE from the alley below sends him CRASHING to the 
      gravel floor and tumbling to a stop.

      EXT. DARK ALLEYWAY - NIGHT99

      Kate peers out from behind the rifle scope, lips curled into 
      a smile. She loves this stuff. 

      HEADLIGHTS appear around the corner. A BLACK SUV pulls up 
      beside her, Argent behind the wheel.

                                  ARGENT
                    Get in.

                                  KATE

      Kate crosses to the passenger side to join him. 

1010EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 

      The halo of a street light showcases Kate s damaged car. 
      Argent s SUV skids to a stop. He and Kate get out.

                                  KATE
                    I know there are two. And one of 
                    them just attacked me.

      As they head for her car, their VOICES change, words carrying 
      past the road and into the woods...

                                  ARGENT (V.O.)
                    One of them is going to lead us to 
                    the other. He can t do that if he s 
                    dead.

                                  KATE (V.O.)
                    And I can t help kill either of 
                    them if one of them kills me first.

      HIDING BEHIND A TREE and with his back to it, Scott uses his 
      augmented HEARING to listen in.

                                  ARGENT (V.O.)
                    How long will it take?

                                  KATE (V.O.)
                    I d give him 48 hours. If that.

1111EXT. DARK ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 

      Derek slips down the side of a building to the pavement. 
      Leaning back against the brick, he inspects the gunshot wound 
      on his left arm.

      It isn t healing. 

      But that s not the strangest part. Because it isn t just 
      blood seeping from the wound. Slim tendrils of SMOKE waft out 
      from a bizarrely GLOWING wound. 

      This was no ordinary bullet...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/GUEST ROOM - DAY1212

      Early morning. A SCREAM pierces the house. But it s a shriek 
      of delight as Allison nearly tackles Kate with a hug. Argent 
      calls out from another room--

                                  ARGENT (O.S.)
                    Allison!

      She lets Kate go, both of them laughing, ecstatic to see each 
      other. Kate has been unpacking her things, bags everywhere.

                                  KATE
                    Okay, I don t see you for a year 
                    and you turn into a freaking runway 
                    model? Look at you. I hate you.

                                    ALLISON
                    I haven t even showered yet.

                                  KATE
                    You re a knockout. I hope you have 
                    boys knocking each other s teeth 
                    out for your attention.

                                    ALLISON
                    I sort of have one.

                                  KATE
                    You should sort of have a million.

                                    ALLISON
                    Need any help unpacking?

      Allison reaches for one of the bags, a LARGE BLACK ONE. But 
      Kate grabs her wrist. It s quick. Startling.

                                  KATE
                    Not that one.

      Allison pulls her hand away, rubbing at her wrist.

                    See what I mean? You turn out

                    Yeah. Just needed a jump start.*

      Allison glances up with a curious look as the door closes.*

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY1313

      Knees bouncing nervously underneath his desk, Scott watches 
      the TEACHER return GRADED TESTS, coming closer and closer. 
      Behind him, Stiles leans forward to whisper.

                                  STILES
                    If Derek s not the Alpha--if he s

                    I don t know. 

      Stiles sits back, thinking. He leans forward again.

                    Did the Alpha kill the bus driver?

                    I don t know.

                    Does Allison s dad know about the

                    I DON T KNOW.

      Scott slinks down in his seat when he realizes everyone is 
      staring at him. The Teacher finally drops his test on his 
      desk. He turns it over to see a big D- and a message:

      Not like you! What s happening? See me after class.

      Stiles peers over his shoulder at the grade.

                                  STILES
                    Dude, you need to study more.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY1414

      A crowd of colorful sneakers passes through the hall, 
      students rushing to class. As the hallway clears of people, a 
      dark figure steps in... 

      Derek. Pale, with black circles under his eyes, bloody 
      bandages can be seen underneath his jacket sleeve.

      A remaining student or two gaze at him. He pays no attention, 
      moving with focus toward one teenager still at his locker--

      Jackson turns to see Derek coming right for him. He takes an 
      involuntary step back.

                                  DEREK
                    Because I asked you politely. And I 
                    only do that once.

                    you if you tell me what you re 
                    selling him?

                    You look wrecked.

      Derek sizes Jackson up, practically smelling the desperate 
      need for power on him.

                                  DEREK
                    I ll find him myself.

      He turns to go, but Jackson grabs him by the shoulder.

                    Hey, we re not done--

      Derek GRABS HIM by the NECK. Jackson tries to pry his fingers 
      off but he s too strong. He gasps, choking until finally--

      Derek seems to realize what he s doing and releases him. 
      Jackson doubles over, sucking in air. While the boy is bent 
      forward, Derek notices--

      PUNCTURES ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK from the CLAWS coming out 
      of Derek s fingertips. He stares at them in alarm.

      Still gasping, Jackson looks up to see Derek disappear around 
      the corner. The boy reaches to the back of his neck, 
      fingertips coming away bloody.        TEEN WOLF EP#104 "EPISODE 104" BUFF DRAFT11/17/1010.


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/ADJACENT CORRIDOR - DAY1515

      Derek slumps against the lockers. Weakened and losing 
      control, he closes his eyes to try a new tactic. He 
      listens...

      SOUNDS filter into his head. Teenagers gossiping, teachers 
      lecturing, cell phone buttons clicking, and then--

                    I move too often. But when I met

                    Right after school.

      Down the hall, a crowd parts to reveal Derek. He gazes up to 
      a clock on the wall: 2:30pm. As the bell RINGS and students 
      pour of the classroom, Derek slips out an exit.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DAY1717

      Students rush the parking lot, racing for their cars at the 
      end of the day. Stiles hops into his Jeep. He pulls out, 
      swinging around for the exit when--

      Derek steps right in front of him. Stiles SLAMS on the 
      brakes. All of the cars behind him SQUEAL to a stop as well, 
      a near pile-up in the school lot.

      Stiles pushing Derek into the Jeep.

      But as he slumps down in the passenger seat, Derek latches 
      onto Scott s arm, not letting him go.

      With a nod, he slowly follows her inside.

      The door to Allison s room clicks open. Scott steps in, 
      glancing around. There s nothing on the walls, no books on 
      the shelves. Just furniture and MOVING BOXES.

                                    ALLISON

      Still nervous, Scott sits down on the bed and opens his bag, 
      yanking books out.        TEEN WOLF EP#104 "EPISODE 104" BUFF DRAFT11/17/1016.

                    History so I brought the study

      He pauses, realizing Allison is standing over him.

                    Let s start with something else.

      Scott nods. Her hands gently come to his neck as she eases 
      down to press her lips against his. The kiss is soft at 
      first. But then Scott pulls her closer. And closer...

      She falls back onto the bed allowing him to slip on top of 
      her. Then kissing her harder, his hands GRASP at her, fingers 
      dragging at her shirt. When they come up again, his nails 
      SHARPEN into CLAWS. Realizing it, he pulls away.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    What s wrong?

      Scott clenches his hands into fists to cover his fingers, 
      pushing them into the bed covers.

                    question?

      As she smiles and rises up to kiss him again, Scott s PHONE 
      RINGS. He doesn t move, keeping his hands balled into fists.

                                    ALLISON

      fall over the various stacked boxes, searching for something 
      that might help Derek.

      Kate and Mrs. Argent. They eat. Quietly. Scott s phone 
      VIBRATES. It s Stiles calling again. He hits IGNORE.

                    Hockey on grass is called field

                    I think the goalie probably had a 
                    defective stick. But yeah, Scott 
                    played well.

      Allison slams her glass down on the table. Scott notices her

      Everyone turns to Scott. A moment of awkward silence. And 
      then Kate laughs. Argent reluctantly cracks a smile.

      Scott reaches under the table for Allison s hand. As his 
      fingers intertwine with hers she finally softens.

      takes his hand off the knob and turns around.

                    I should get going. Thanks again 
                    for dinner.

                                  KATE
                    Stay for dessert. I want to hear 
                    more about you. Sit down.

      Scott reluctantly sits back down at the table. His phone 
      VIBRATES again.

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    Allison was saying you work for a 
                      veterinarian.

                                    ALLISON
                    I told them how you put the cast on 
                    the dog I hit.

      Scott glances at Stiles s text: Need to get here now!!!

                                  ARGENT
                    What s your boss think of the 
                    animal attacks? Any theories?

                                  SCOTT
                      Everybody s saying mountain lion.

                                  KATE
                    That would have to be a pretty 
                    large mountain lion.

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    What do you think, Scott?

                                  SCOTT
                      I wouldn t really know. We get 
                    mostly dogs and cats at the clinic. 
                    Nothing that vicious.

                                  ARGENT
                    Never had to deal with a rabid dog?

      Scott shakes his head.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    I grew up with a lot of dogs. I saw 
                    one get rabies from a bat. It was 
                      transferred through the bite. Sad, 
                    but kind of fascinating. People 
                    think a rabid dog just suddenly 
                    goes mad. It s actually a lot more 
                    gradual.

                    The first stage is subtle changes 
                    in behavior. They re restless, 
                    morose.

      The room becomes quiet and oddly still while Argent speaks.

                    It s the second stage that everyone 
                    knows. The  furious phase.  That s 
                    when they attack. And we re talking 
                    any moving object. Did you know a 
                    caged, rabid dog will break its own 
                    teeth trying to chew through the 
                    bars? It ll even rear back and snap 
                    its own spine. Can you imagine the 
                    amount of force it takes to do 
                    that?

      Scott shakes his head.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    It s a complete character reversal. 
                    This harmless animal turns into a 
                    perfectly vicious killer. And it 
                    all starts with one bite.

      Scott slowly looks from Argent to Kate. She seems almost as 
      if she s trying to contain a smile, enjoying the description 
      of the animal s downfall and demise.

                                    ALLISON
                    But it died, didn t it?

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    Well, yes. Your grandfather shot 
                    it.

                                    ALLISON
                    Because he wanted to put it out of 
                    its misery.

                                  ARGENT
                    Because it was too dangerous. 
                    Something that out-of-control is 
                    better off dead.

      Derek clicks on a light and slowly pulls his shirt off to 
      reveal the gunshot wound is now far worse. VEINS branch out

      Allison escorts Scott to the front door.

                    they were getting divorced. This is 
                    a close second.

      This earns a laugh. She grabs the lapel of his jacket and 
      pulls him in for a kiss. But Scott slowly pulls back.        TEEN WOLF EP#104 "EPISODE 104" BUFF DRAFT11/17/1034.

      Hearing MUFFLED ARGUING through the closed door, he mounts

      Scott holds up the bullet. Derek grabs it, raises it up to 
      look at it in the light.

                                  STILES
                    What are you going to do?

                    I m going to... I m going...

      He falls. Collapsing right to the floor. The bullet drops and 
      goes rolling. Scott darts after it.

      The bullet drops through a METAL GRATE and into a DRAIN. 
      Kneeling down, Scott digs his fingers into the grate, but he 
      can t reach the bullet.

      Across the room, Stiles tries to wake Derek.

                                  STILES
                    Derek? Derek, wake up! Scott, what 
                    the hell are we going to do?

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know--the bullet--I can t

                                  STILES
                    He s not waking up!

      UNDER THE GRATE - The bullet lies just out of Scott s grasp. 
      The tips of his finger and thumb graze the metal, but can t 
      get around it.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    I think he s dying. I think he s 
                    dead.

                                  SCOTT
                    Just hold on!

      Scott squeezes his eyes shut, pushing further down. With his 
      teeth clenched, something happens...

      His fingernails begin to SHARPEN, extending to CLAWS. It 
      gives him just enough reach to pluck the bullet out. Scott 
      leaps to his feet.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    I got it!

      Stiles looks down at Derek.

                                  STILES
                    Please don t kill me for this.

      He punches Derek RIGHT IN THE FACE. As Stiles staggers back, 
      cradling his hand, Derek s eyes flutter open.

                                  DEREK
                    Give it to me.

      Scott tosses Derek the bullet as he struggles to his feet. 
      Derek cracks the tip open and pulls out a LIGHTER from his 
      pocket. He holds the FLAME to the contents inside.        TEEN WOLF EP#104 "EPISODE 104" BUFF DRAFT11/17/1040.

      SPARKS FLY as bits of wolfsbane light aflame. He palms the 
      smoldering ashes and grinds it into his gunshot wound, 
      wincing as he does so.

      Derek drops back to his knees on the floor. He opens his 
      mouth, revealing his sharpened fangs.

      Stiles and Scott step back. Down the hall, the dogs BARK, 
      building to a frenzy as they rattle the cages.

      Derek tilts his head back and... SCREAMS.

      It s an ear-piercing, earth shattering howl of agony. And 
      then he tumbles back, sweat-soaked skin hitting the cold 
      cement floor. His arm falls to his side. In seconds, the open 
      sores close, wounds healing, returning to normal.

      Scott and Stiles share a incredulous look. 

                                  STILES
                    That. Was. Awesome. 

      Derek s eyes blink open. Slowly, he pushes himself back up 
      from the floor. Catching his breath, he stands upright.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you okay?

                                  DEREK

                    I m guessing the ability to use 
                    sarcasm is a sign of good health.

      Derek grabs his shirt, pulling it back on.

3838INT. BEACON HILLS HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 

      A sign on the wall of the dark corridor reads: LONG-TERM 
      CARE. Scott follows Derek past it while throwing glances back 
      to see if they re still alone in the hall.

                                  SCOTT
                    What are we doing here?

      But Derek doesn t answer, just continuing toward a room at 
      the end of the hall.

3939INT. BEACON HILLS HOSPITAL/PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT 

      Derek ushers Scott into the dark hospital room, quietly 
      closing the door behind them. He pulls the curtain back from 
      the window to let in the MOONLIGHT which reveals--

      A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR sitting nearby. Only one side of his 
      body can be seen, a blank, catatonic expression on his face. 

                                  SCOTT
                    Who is he? 

                                  DEREK

                    He was. Now he s barely even human.

      Grabbing the arm of the chair, he pulls PETER HALE around. As 
      the man s head lolls to the side, Scott sees--

      SEVERE BURN SCARS on the other side of his body. Darkened 
      flesh twists across his face, down his neck and arm.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Six years ago my sister and I were 
                    at school when my house caught

                    Like what? What justifies this? 
                    They say they ll only kill an adult 
                    and only with absolute proof. But 
                    there were members of my family who 
                    were perfectly ordinary in that 
                    fire. This is what they do.

      He turns Peter s face to Scott so he can see it perfectly in 
      the light.

                    It s what Allison will do.

      Derek pauses, sensing something. He takes a step back as the 
      door opens, a NIGHT NURSE, named JENNIFER, looking in.

                                  JENNIFER
                    What are you doing? How did you get 
                    in here?

      She retreats from the door as if to yell for security. But 
      then stops when she sees Derek in the light from the window.

                                  DEREK
                    We were leaving.

                    Wait. Are you a relative?

      He doesn t answer, heading past her. Not knowing what else to 
      do, Scott follows. SHE looks after them, curious.

      Allison steps outside, putting her cell phone to her ear.

                    I wanted to say sorry again. For 
                    tonight. Call me.

      Allison hangs up. Then notices Kate s car in the driveway. In 
      perfect condition. No sign of any damage whatsoever. Allison 
      is about to turn back when--

      Something crunches under her foot. She looks down and sees a *
      piece of BROKEN GLASS.*

      Glancing to the car, she approaches. At the edge of the *
      driver s side window a PIECE OF GLASS reflects the light. 

      Allison takes her index finger and drags it over the rubber 
      window guard at the edge of the door. Several small 
      crystalline BITS OF GLASS tumble one by one to the pavement 
      of the driveway.

      Kate s car trouble appears to have required more than a jump 
      start. Much more...

      playfully flicks a LIGHTER.
