	Lois wears an open-necked blouse and unusually short skirt
	businesslike but more provocative than her norm.

				CLARK
		How did you get this interview?

				LOIS
		He called me.

				CLARK
		What a coup.

	JIMMY OLSEN puts in his two cents...

				JIMMY
		Vincent Winninger.  The mad
		scientist...

				LOIS
		He's not 'mad.'  He's eccentric.

	CAT GRANT perks up when she HEARS the name.

				CAT

		You're going to interview Vincent
		Winninger?

				LOIS
	Yes.

				CAT
			(to no one and everyone)
		That explains the vain attempt to
		look sexy.

				JIMMY
		Watch out, Lois--Vincent Winninger
		is a notorious...

				CAT
		Womanizer.  Maybe I should go with
		you.

				LOIS
		Or maybe you shouldn't.

	As if for the first time, Clark notes her outfit.

	PHOTOGRAPHS, CITATIONS on a wall - the photographs
	impressive but not self-important.  Presidents from Ike to

	Marilyn's cleavage.

	Several PHOTOS of the Elimont group at work and play... a
	conference... the dance... some theater productions: "A 
	Streetcar Named Desire," "Look Back in Anger,"
	"Marat/Sade," others.

				LOIS
		And these theatrical photos?

				VINCENT

	Lois points to a person in the picture.

				LOIS
		Isn't this ... ?

		Yes, Barbara Trevino.  She's come a

		To chairperson of the Rain Forest

		Well, not until Tuesday.  But we're

		No!

	Lois freezes.  Vincent's second "No!" is cut off by a dry,

16	LOIS' POV - WINNINGER'S STUDY			16

	Winninger's lifeless hand.  The KILLER kneels, feels
	Winninger's pulse.  Lois gets a good look at his: he's
	small, plain, even pleasant-looking, not young, wearing a
	bow tie.  He stands up...



	WITNESS   (#10)     Blue Rev.     10/27/93		8.


  17	LOIS						17

	silently, closes the door, hoping the final closure
	doesn't give her away.  She backs against the wall, SEES
	the notebook on the commode lid.

	The hand grabs the knob, turns it...


  21	INSIDE THE POWDER ROOM				21

	The door opens.  The Killer enters, removing his shirt.
	The notebook is gone.  He unwraps a bar of scrub soap,
	tosses the wrapper into the trash can, puts the bar on the
	sink, looks in the mirror.  He does not see Lois.


  22	ANGLE BEHIND THE DOOR - LOIS			22

	... flattened between the wall and door. If the Killer
	closes the door she's done for.  Fortunately he does not
	close the door.  He turns on the tap, washes, scrubs...
	Lois can scarcely breathe.  The washing lasts an eternity.
	Finally the Killer, his eyes closed from all the soap and
	water, reaches blindly for a towel, dangles close to Lois'
	face.  Lois hands him the towel.  He exits the powder	*
	room, taking the towel with his.  Lois breathes a little
	easier but doesn't dare move.

				JIMMY
		Winninger's notebook.  It contains

		Star labs has broken it down, but

		Mr. Tracewski, are you all right?

	Tracewski closes in an Lois, grabs her by the neck.	*

	But in an instant Tracewski gets a now grip, tightening	*

		According to the police, Sebastian	*

				LOIS
		I can top that I just talked to
		the dean of the Philosophy
		department at Metropolis
		University.  He used to be a
		member of the Elimont Commune.  He

		I can top that.  Dr. Hubert, the

				LOIS
		That's great but, we still don't

		increased male potency, the

		The police questioned her and she's

		She was getting in her limo.  She

		I knew Winninger was about to
		expose my true motivation in
		wanting to be appointed chairperson
		of the Rain Forest Consortium.	*
		From there it would have bean easy
		to grant Hobbs the exclusive strip	*
		mining licenses they needed to
		exploit the area.  So, I called on
		our old friend Finn to eliminate	*
		him.  But, Finn left a loose and.

				LOIS
		Me.

				BARBARA
		And the notebook. Where in it?



				LOIS
		There's nothing in the notebook
		except Winninger's processing
		formula for the male potency plant.

		Then I guess I went to a lot of
		trouble for no nothing.  But, with the
		strip mining proceeding as we speak
		and you eliminated....

				LOIS
		Eliminated?

				BARBARA
		I guess that's the way it goes
		sometimes.

	She takes aim, but a NOISE behind her distracts her.
	Trevino instinctively whirls around; in a split second
	Lois is upon her, gripping her wrist, holding it up.  The
	gun FIRES at the ceiling, but Lois bangs Trevino's wrist
	against a cabinet, again, again, and again, but they're
	stalemated...

				LOIS
		Help!

	Trevino's hand is at Lois' throat, pushing Lois' head
	back.  Lois is in pain, in jeopardy of losing her grip.
	But then HANDS encircle Trevino's throat from behind,
	squeeze, pull, until Trevino's hand releases Lois, her
	other hand drops the gun, and Trevino is wrestled to the
	floor.  Lois falls with Trevino, trapping her there, then
	looks up to SEE her latest savior.  It's...

91	JIMMY						91

	... looking down at them.

				LOIS
		Help me, Jimmy!

	Jimmy kneels, holds Trevino down.

				LOIS

		Grab her... it!

	Jimmy lunges, grabs at Trevino's neck.  She runs out the
	door, but comes flying back into the rom as fast as she
	left.  A beat later, Superman walks through the door.
	Relief floods Lois' face, but she can't resist a little
	dig.

				LOIS
		Cutting it kind of close there,
		aren't you, big fella?

				SUPERMAN
		Are you all right?

	Lois and Jimmy.  Lois hangs up the phone.

				LOIS
		Superman got there in time.  All
		mining operations have been
		suspended and the authorities are
		cleaning house at the Rain Forest
		Consortium.  I guess everything's	*
		back to normal.

	Clark enters.

				CLARK
		Sorry I took so long.  Anything
		happen while I was gone?

	Jimmy and Lois share a secret smile.

				LOIS/JIMMY
		Not a thing.

	Clark enjoys a secret smile of his own.

				LOIS
			(to Clark)
		Come on.

					FADE OUT.
