It is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of
Boston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things.
SHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark
young man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears
the flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs
and a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band.

FOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages.
His smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without
stopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is
not dissuaded.
Malcolm and Shorty come strutting down the street: two conked,
zoot-suited sharpies. Hometown boy has departed. And the CHICKS on the
street notice them, especially Malcolm, the taller of the two, the
lighter-skinned, the more dominant. They walk imperiously past, fully
aware of their impact.
CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM
FREEZE FRAME. He becomes a STILL.
VOICE OF MALCOLM X
When my mother was pregnant with me, she told
me later, a party of Klansmen on horseback
surrounded our house in Omaha.
10A 	ANGLE. KLAN on horses in front of house.
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
They brandished guns and shouted for my father
to come out. My mother went to the door where
they could see her pregnant condition...
ANGLE. A pregnant Louise Little on porch.
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
...and told them my father was in Milwaukee,
preaching.
ANGLE. The Klan breaks all the windows in the house then rides off into
the glorious D.W. Griffith _Birth of a Nation_ moonlit night.
CLOSE - LOUISE LITTLE
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
The hooded Klansman said the good, white
Christians would not stand for his
troublemaking, and to get out of town.
ANGLE. The terrified Little children look out a broken window at their
mother.
ANGLE. AN OLD FRAME HOUSE IN OMAHA
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
They broke every window with their rifle butts
before riding off into the night, their torches
flaming.
ANGLE. FRONT PORCH OF THE LITTLE HOUSE - AN EMPTY ROCKER ON IT
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
My father was not a frightened Negro as most
were then and as many still are today. He was
six feet four and very black...
10B 	CLOSE - EARL LITTLE
He looks directly into the camera, wearing a Baptist Minister's robe.
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
...and had a glass eye. He believed, as did
Marcus Garvey, that freedom, independence and
self-respect could never be achieved by the
Negro in America . . .
10C 	CLOSE - EARL LITTLE
He wears a Garvey hat, ornate with gold braid.
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
...that, therefore, black men should leave
America and return to the land of their origin.
10D 	ANGLE. Earl Little, in a wagon with little Malcolm.
CLOSE - EARL LITTLE:
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
My father dedicated his life to his beliefs
because he had seen four of his six brothers
die violently...
10E 	WIDER ANGLE. WE SEE Earl in front of a podium in church. He is
preaching.
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
...three killed by white men and one lynched.
There are nine children in our family.
ANGLE. The nine Little children.
CLOSE - LOUISE LITTLE
She is a pretty, mature woman and white-looking.
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
My mother was an attractive woman, an educated
woman, a strong woman.
10F CLOSE - LOUISE AND EARL
A posed wedding picture, serious but sweet.
VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
She was very light, her mama was raped by a
white man. One of the reasons she married my
father was because he was so black, she
disliked her complexion and wanted her children
to have some color.

LAURA
I ain't stupid.
MALCOLM
I mean it's late, baby.
LAURA
I know where you're going.
MALCOLM
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need
my rest.
Laura walks to the door.
MALCOLM (contd)
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
LAURA
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
The front door opens, it's Laura's grandmother, MRS. JOHNSON.
MALCOLM
'Night, Mrs. Johnson.
He runs down the porch steps.
A bright, sunny day, long shadows in the park. The Commons is almost
empty. Two improbable zoot-suited blacks race past trees, and run over
the grass. Malcolm and Shorty are playing Cops and Robbers while
PASSERSBY stare.
SHORTY
Bang, bang. You're dead.
MALCOLM
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for
size.
Malcolm fires an imaginary tommy machine gun at Shorty.
SHORTY
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof
vest.
MALCOLM
The hell you are.
SHORTY
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna
be Bogart sometimes.
MALCOLM
You're too small to be Bogart.
SHORTY
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
Shorty shoots Malcolm from behind.
SHORTY (contd)
Pow. Take that.
Malcolm acts as if he's been hit.
MALCOLM
Ahhh! You got me, you dirty, filthy, rotten,
stinking copper, only a low-down yellow rat
bastard would shoot a man in the back.
Malcolm starts to stagger, this is a long drawn out Hollywood drawn-out
death a la Cagney death in _Public Enemy_.
LOW ANGLE - MALCOLM
Malcolm falls directly into the camera, face first, and Shorty stands
over him.
SHORTY
He use to be a big shot.

MATCH CUT
CLOSE EARL LITTLE
Earl Little's face is in the same exact position as Malcolm's from the
previous scene. His mouth opens in terror as the moving trolley comes
closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks.
Malcolm and Laura are on a deserted Cape beach. They are dressed but
have their shoes and socks off, and he has his trousers rolled up. They
walk, like birds, avoiding getting their feet wet as the waves roll in.
LAURA
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got
class and you're smart.
MALCOLM
All them books you read and you still don't
know nuthin.
LAURA
I do know I love you.
Laura stops him and moves to him. Her kiss is a tender one, exploratory.
Then Malcolm responds, embracing her fully. Her arms go around him as
they both drop into the sand.
CLOSE - MALCOLM AND LAURA
LAURA
Oh, Malcolm, I love you. Please, there's no one
around. Now?
Malcolm turns his head from her, he gets up.
MALCOLM
Let's go.
LAURA
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say
you're running around town with her.
MALCOLM
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause
your grandma's smarter than ya think.
She looks at him.
LAURA
She raised me, my mother died when I was six.
Is your mother alive?
MALCOLM
Yeah, she's alive.

It reads "KALAMAZOO STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE MENTALLY INSANE"
The crack train of the New York, New Haven & Hartford speeds through
the New England countryside.
As the Clipper surfaces in Harlem, pulls up to the 125th Street
station.
Malcolm, out of uniform and dressed in his zoot suit, comes down from
the Park Avenue station in Harlem. He is hit with the sights and sounds.
Everything delights him: the noise, the lights, the women, the pimps,
the signs, the windows, the crowds, the laughter, the music.

CROWD
The Brown Bomber, The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis,
the heavyweight champion of the world. Joe got
the belt back. Lawd have mercy. Great day in
the morning.
50A	CLOSE - MALCOLM
He runs after them.
All traffic has stopped, there is a huge spontaneous celebration going
on. Black folks are everywhere, it seems as if all of Harlem is out on
the streets. The citizens of Harlem are hugging, kissing, drinking,
dancing, folks are hanging from street lamps, yelling out their
windows, holding up hand-made JOE LOUIS banners, everyone has great
reason to be joyous. The heavyweight champion of the world is a BLACK
MAN -- JOE LOUIS, THE BROWN BOMBER, he has regained his championship.
CLOSE: - MALCOLM
Malcolm quickly looks at his watch, he's running late for his train, as
he fights his way through the crowd like a salmon going upstream, the
CAMERA CRANES up to see him eventually get lost in a sea of BLACK
HUMANITY "cutting loose."
FADE OUT.

FADE IN:
Malcolm, newly conked and sharp as a tack (zoot suit, trouser crease
like a knife's edge, orange knob-toed shoes) walks toward his goal:
Small's Paradise.
The street is crowded with PEOPLE, KIDS and HUSTLERS.
YOUNG HOOKER
Slow down, daddy, what's your hurry? Lemme show
you somepin brand new.
Malcolm smiles "No thanks" keeps moving.
HUSTLER
Hey, man, hundred-dollar ring -- diamond; and a
ninety dollar watch. Take the both of them for
a quarter; twenty-five bucks.
Malcolm waves; he's not having any. Goes on.
Before entering, Malcolm sharps himself a bit, picking off some lint,
cocking his hat. And enters.
A FIVE DOLLAR BILL. CAMERA GOES IN for the last three digits.
64A	STOCK MARKET BOARD at the end of a day's trading. GO IN for the last

A tiny alleyway. No one is visible.
ARCHIE
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Malcolm comes running out of an alleyway and onto the street. He stops
to catch his breath, to regain his composure. He is shook up,
frustrated, but mostly saddened. He then runs down the block and into a
CLOSEUP.
The entire house is in flames. The Little family stands in front of it,
just out of harm's way.

CLOSE - YOUNG MALCOLM
Young Malcolm stares at his father while the house still burns behind
him, no doubt drawing on the great courage displayed by his father.
EARL
They won't be here no time soon. I'm a MAN!
It's raining cats and dogs and it's foggy. We hear a big thud, then a
grunt and Earl Little falls across the trolley tracks, the sound of men
running away is heard in the distance.

MOTORMAN'S VOICE
No doctor, get him a priest.
VOICE OF MALCOLM X
My father's skull, on one side was crushed in,
and then laid across some tracks, for a
streetcar to run him over. His body was cut
almost in half. My father, Earl Little lived
two and a half hours in that condition. Negroes
were stronger than they are now.
The robbery, IN QUICK CUTS:
--A door lock is picked by Sophia.
96A	--Pencil flashlight passes an upstairs window.
96B	--Rudy in the car.
96C	--Silver removed from a drawer by Shorty.
96D	--Peg walking down the street, as lookout.
96E	--Malcolm takes off his shoes.
96F	--The sleeping OLD MAN, OLD TALCUM POWDER, as Malcolm takes a watch, a
wallet from within inches of his pillow. Then, more boldly, picks up
the man's hand and removes a ring from one of his fingers. Shorty
watching with bated breath, he's about to have a heart attack.
A baseball game is in progress. A BLACK TEAM is playing a WHITE ONE.
Most of the CONVICTS are watching the game; partisanship at every
pitch. A base hit gets a big reaction.
ANGLE - MALCOLM AND BEMBRY
They are out along the right field wall. They walk throughout the scene.
ANGLE - The ball is hit over the fence for a home run. There is a big
cheer from the black prisoners. Pete, the batter, trots proudly around
the bases.
MALCOLM
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay
in there with the wood.
BEMBRY
Lemme tell you about history: black history.
You listening?
TWO-SHOT - Malcolm still watching the game.
MALCOLM
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
BEMBRY
The first men on earth were black. They ruled
and there was not one white face anywhere. But
they teach us that we lived in caves and swung
from trees. Black men were never like that.
Malcolm is listening to Bembry's intent statement.
BEMBRY (contd)
We were a race of kings when the white men went
around on all fours.
There is a crack of the bat and Malcolm turns to watch another base
hit, by a black convict, stir the crowd.
MALCOLM
This a helluva game. Somethin's going on.
He sees a black convict, CHUCK, nearby and calls over:
MALCOLM (contd)
Hey, whatsa score?
CHUCK
10 to 1; we murdering them, Din't you hear?
MALCOLM
What?
CHUCK
The Brooklyn Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson
and we pounding the hell out of them,
celebrating.
MALCOLM
How bout that?
BEMBRY
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's
supposed to make us forget 400 years.
MALCOLM
A black man playing big league ball is
something.
BEMBRY
I told you to go behind the words and dig out
the truth. They let us sing and dance and
smile -- and now they let one black man in the
majors. That don't cancel out the greatest
crime in history. When that blue-eyed devil
locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us --
broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off
from our language, our religion, our history.
SHOTS OF THE FACES OF THE BLACK BALL PLAYERS AND THE CONVICTS
In the stands, cheering and joyous.
BEMBRY (contd)
Do they know who they are? Do you know where
you came from? We are the Original People.
Malcolm is listening to him now.
BEMBRY (contd)
What's your name, boy?
Malcolm is startled; answers like a boy.
MALCOLM
Little.
BEMBRY
No. That's the name of the slave-master who
owned your family. You don't even know who you
are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero.
Who are you?
CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM
Wrapped in thought.
ANGLE ON MALCOLM
MALCOLM
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
BEMBRY
Who are you?
CLOSE - MALCOLM
Malcolm cannot answer because he truly does not know.
A ball is hit. Malcolm watches its flight but his face is fixed
somewhere between understanding and anger: it is the face of the future
leader.
BEMBRY
I told you we are a nation, the lost Tribe of
Shabazz in the wilderness of North America.
Sunday service has let out and Malcolm, Earl, and Sidney are "fishing."
They're trying to convert the Black Christians. Malcolm speaks, while
the others hand out leaflets.
MALCOLM
You think you are Christians, and yet you see
your so-called white Christian brother hanging
black Christians on trees. You say that white
man loves you and yet he has done every evil
act against you. He has everything while he is
living and tells you to be a good slave and
when you die you will have more than he has in
Beulah's land. We so-called Negroes are in
pitiful shape. Get off your knees praying to
a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed
Jesus. Come out of the sky. Build heaven on
earth. Islam is the black man's true religion.
Malcolm is talking to a CROWD from a ladder.
MALCOLM
And that the white man is the devil. Yes, God
is black and you are made in His image and
don't know it. That's how brainwashed you are.
The crowd is listening, caught up in Malcolm's intensity.
MALCOLM (contd)
My brothers and sisters, they tell you you will
sprout wings when you die and fly to heaven.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad tells you that's
pie in the sky.
ANGLE ON SIDNEY
Amid the listeners, watching their response.
MALCOLM'S VOICE
Have you ever seen a black man who wasn't down
on his knees begging the Lord to give him in
heaven what the white devil enjoys right here
on earth?
CLOSE SHOT - SEVERAL LISTENERS
They turn from Malcolm, moving a few steps away, and now are the
audience on an adjacent SPEAKER. He is a young firebrand:
SPEAKER
The Harlem Council fights for rat control, for
rent control and for community control of our
schools.
PAN CONTINUES to take in ANOTHER SPEAKER, a few feet away. WE SEE the
street corner is Harlem's Hyde Park, with half a dozen SPEAKERS
haranguing the crowd with half a dozen panaceas. That Malcolm is just
one among many:
SECOND SPEAKER
If the man behind the counter ain't black,
don't go in. Boycott the man. Be black. Think
black. Buy black.
ANGLE - MALCOLM
MALCOLM
Come to our Temple and hear the truth. Because,
brother and sister, you are dead. Yes you are,
mentally dead, spiritually dead, morally dead.
And we are here to resurrect the black man
back from the dead.
A place where black women come to offer themselves for day work.
SEVERAL ARE SEEN. A WHITE WOMEN comes up to one to interview her
(bargain with her). Malcolm's voice is heard before he is seen,
speaking to the women from a ladder.
MALCOLM'S VOICE
My beautiful sister, for you are beautiful.
Beautiful because you are black. Because black
is beautiful. You work in the white folks'
kitchen so I don't have to tell you that
they're devils.
CLOSE - MALCOLM
MALCOLM (contd)
And you are putting yourselves on the auction
block, letting them examine you like a horse,
like a slave. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches that you are black and should be
proud...
FACE OF ONE BLACK WOMAN, beginning to shake her head in accord.
Malcolm walks thoughtfully down the street; Archie is still on his
mind, as he passes prostitute after prostitute. Once beautiful women
now selling their bodies. He passes Laura, she has been turned totally
out and she looks the part, there is no way he can recognize her. We do
though.
CLOSE - LAURA
She has just gotten a white John and leads him into an alley.
MALCOLM'S VOICE
Women who could be mothers, teachers,
scientists...
ANGLE - ALLEY
Laura kneels down to unzip her John's pants.
MALCOLM'S VOICE (contd)
Who is going to raise our children?; men who
might have been astronauts, composers,
engineers; Who is going to be the head of the
households?--
Malcolm sits next to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. The student and the
teacher.
MALCOLM
If you want to tell me.
ELIJAH
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy
flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied
down or messed up by women.
CUT BACK TO:
138B 	BETTY AND MALCOLM
Betty says nothing, she merely pushes the salad plate a little toward
him. The food has thus far gone untouched. Malcolm continues.
CLOSE - MALCOLM
MALCOLM
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to
talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a
gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the
strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by
the woman who slept in his arms.
BETTY
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose
marriage?
CUT TO:
CLOSE - ELIJAH
ELIJAH
No. We are not Catholic priests. We do not
practice celibacy. If a woman is the right
height for a man, the right complexion, if her
age is half the man's plus seven, if she
understands that man's essential nature is
strong and woman's weak, if she loves children,
can cook, sew and stay out of trouble--
CUT TO:
CLOSE - BETTY
BETTY
I think you've made your points, Brother
Malcolm.
MALCOLM
What points?
BETTY
That you haven't time for either marriage or
eating--
Malcolm chuckles a bit.
BETTY (contd)
--and that women aren't the only ones who
talk a lot.
Now he bursts out laughing.
CLOSE - BROTHERS SIDNEY AND EARL
They are alarmed at Brother Minister's behavior.
TWO-SHOT - BETTY AND MALCOLM
BETTY
If you'll start eating, there is a question I
have. Go ahead. Start.
He takes a forkful of the salad.
BETTY (contd)
Considering today's standards of animal raising
and curing meats, I don't fully understand the
restriction on pork.
MALCOLM
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that.
I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's
demonstration purely in the interest of
science, you understand?
BETTY'S VOICE:
Yes, I understand, Brother Malcolm. Purely
scientific.
Malcolm listening as SEVERAL WITNESSES simultaneously describe the
attack. A small angry CROWD has gathered. The most animated one is
BENJAMIN, a very dark young black teenager, we will soon meet him
later.
BENJAMIN
The cop says, "Move on."
MAN
The Brother didn't scatter fast enough for the
ofay.
CLOSE - MALCOLM
BENJAMIN
Crack. He bled like a stuck hog.
MAN
Watcha gonna do?
VOICE FROM THE CROWD
(deprecatingly)
He'll rap a little. He's a Muslim. And make a
speech.
ANOTHER VOICE FROM CROWD
Muslims talk a good game, but they never do
nothing, unless somebody bothers Muslims.
Malcolm's face goes taut. He nods sharply at Sidney, as Benjamin
watches them both.
MALCOLM'S VOICE
I demand to see Brother Johnson.
Across from the station is a phalanx of some FIFTY MEN of the Fruit
of Islam. All are dressed in dark suits with white shirts. They stand
in military formation: eyes forward, every face burning. People from
the neighborhood have formed a crowd behind and around them. WE MAKE
OUT Benjamin among the crowd.
As Johnson's body, on a stretcher, is hurried into an ambulance. The
crowd has grown in proportions. There are ad libs: "Goddam pigs," "Damn
police brutality," "Least they got him out of the meat house."
Malcolm with the Sergeant and a LIEUTENANT, as the ambulance pulls away.
LIEUTENANT
All right, break it up. You got what you wanted.
MALCOLM
I'm not satisfied.
Malcolm starts walking down the center of the street, after the
ambulance.
MALCOLM (contd)
To the hospital.
The Fruit of Islam fall in behind him, marching slowly. It takes on the
start of a march as the neighborhood people fall in behind them. People
(especially kids) race with them on the street and on the sidewalk.
ANGLE - BENJAMIN
Benjamin fights his way through the crowd trying to walk beside Malcolm,
the Brothers in the Fruit stop him and Benjamin drops back.
Now the march has taken over the broad avenue. COPS are forced to
redirect traffic, holding up crosstown cars as the group walks solemnly
by. The people walking behind have swelled it to a huge demonstration.
Their faces reflect their anger and their satisfaction that, for once,
something is being done about what has happened.
LONG SHOT SHOWS the Muslim men in perfect order, calm with their arms
folded across their chests, waiting. Their eyes are on Malcolm as he
walks toward the hospital entrance.
SHOTS
--of the growing crowd.
--of the nervous cops, including some big brass.
--of kids watching from a rooftop.
--of Benjamin trying to emulate the Fruit of Islam.
Malcolm is standing in front of the Fruit of Islam men, as HIGHRANKING
POLICE OFFICER GREEN comes over.
CAPTAIN GREEN
All right, that's enough. I want these people
moved out of here.
MALCOLM
They're all disciplined men. They're doing
nothing except waiting.
SHOT
The unruly crowd behind the Fruit of Islam. They are restive, milling,
ugly.
CAPTAIN GREEN
What about them?
MALCOLM
That's your headache, Captain. And if he dies,
I pity you.
DOCTOR
He'll live. He's getting the best care we can
give.
MALCOLM
Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR
I had to put a plate in his head.
MALCOLM
(to Captain)
You bastards.
CAPTAIN GREEN
All right, okay. Now disperse this mob.
MEDIUM SHOT - MALCOLM, FRUIT OF ISLAM AND CROWD
It's clear the decision is in one man's hands, Malcolm's.
CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM
He makes a gesture with his hand, the Fruit of Islam disperse.
ANGLE. People moving away, going home. Only one person remains from the
Fruit of Islam and the crowd, it's Benjamin.
CLOSE - CAPTAIN GREEN
CAPTAIN GREEN
That's too much power for one man to have.
MALCOLM
I'm in Detroit.
BETTY
I know.
MALCOLM
At a gas station.
(a beat)
Will you marry me?
BETTY
Yes.
MALCOLM
Did you hear what I said?
BETTY
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
MALCOLM
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
BETTY
Yes. Did you eat?
MALCOLM
I love you.
Malcolm is speaking to a GOOD SIZED AUDIENCE:
MALCOLM
I must emphasize at the outstart, that the
Honorable Elijah Muhammad is not a politician,
so I'm not here this afternoon as a Republican,
nor a Democrat, not as a Mason nor an Elk, not
as a Christian nor a Jew, not as a Catholic nor
a Protestant, not as a Baptist nor a Methodist,
not even as an American. For if I was an
American the problem that confronts our people
today would not exist. So I stand here as what
I was when I was born: A BLACK MAN!
CROWD REACTIONS
MALCOLM (contd)
Before there were any such things as Democrats
or Republicans, we were black. Before there
were any such things as Masons or Elks, we
were black. Before there were any such things
as Jews or Christians, we were black people. In
fact long before there was ever any such place
as America, we were black people... And after
America has long passed from the scene there
will still be BLACK PEOPLE.
CLOSE - BENJAMIN
He is neatly dressed in white shirt, jacket and tie, a fine young
Muslim.
BENJAMIN 2X
Take your time.
Malcolm is walking the streets of Harlem like he is campaigning for
office. He has Brothers Sidney, Earl, and Benjamin at his side, a CROWD
follows him. Malcolm sees a WINO.
MALCOLM
Brother Man, put that bottle down, take that
poison away from your lips. That's what the
devil wants you to do, stay high, out of your
natural mind. I know, I've been there.
The wino looks at Malcolm and continues to drink his wine.
159H	--Malcolm emerges from a doorway to be met by an army of TV REPORTERS
armed with microphones. He walks; they follow.
159I	--Malcolm walking in Harlem, urging people to lift themselves up, come
to the meetings, etc.
Malcolm is talking to a group of PEOPLE who are having a rent strike.
MALCOLM
When you live in a poor neighborhood, you're
living in an area where you have poor schools.
159L 	CUTAWAY TO MALCOLM AND BENJAMIN
Malcolm hands him back his letter again. The fast is getting to
Benjamin.
MALCOLM (contd)
When you have poor schools you have poor
teachers. When you have poor teachers, you get
a poor education.
159M	CUTAWAYS TO THE DESPAIR OF HARLEM - SLUMS, TENEMENTS, GARBAGE, RATS
MALCOLM (contd)
Poor education, you only work on poor paying
jobs and that enables you to live again in a
poor neighborhood.
159N	CUTAWAY TO BLACK FACES
MALCOLM (contd)
So it's a very vicious cycle. We've got to
break it.
A CROWD OF STUDENTS outside the Law School. The setting is the same as
the last time we saw Malcolm and Shorty here, except now the students
part for him. Malcolm walks slowly toward the entrance, looking up at
the Latin inscription of the building when he is stopped by a WHITE
COED.
COED
Mr. X, I've read some of your speeches and I
honestly believe a lot of what you say has
truth to it. I have a good heart. I'm a good
person despite my whiteness. What can the good
white people like myself, who are not
prejudiced, or racist, what can we do to help
the cause?
CLOSE - MALCOLM
He stares at her.
MALCOLM
Nothing!
CLOSE - COED
She is absolutely crushed and runs away in tears.
Malcolm, at the window, as his plane takes off. He is watching Betty
and the children on the Visitors' Ramp. He sees her become a tiny
figure, waving a vivid bandana.
The plane is out of sight. Betty gathers up her children. As they leave
she is subtly surrounded by the protecting BAND OF SUPPORTERS, led by
Earl and Benjamin 2X.

as the representative of our people.
175B 	SHOT OF CIA AGENT
He watches as Malcolm walks between the two pyramids.
MALCOLM'S VOICE (contd)
Our fight is known and respected worldwide.
Incidentally, there's a little white man who
follows me wherever I go.
175C 	SHOT OF MALCOLM
On a camel as he rides toward the Sphinx.
MALCOLM'S VOICE
I wonder who he's working for? If I was a
betting man, I'd say CIA. What's your guess?

I arrived in Jedda, Saudi Arabia. I have never
witnessed such sincere...
--Malcolm, wearing the garb of a pilgrim, walks with a VAST THRONG OF
OTHERS, similarly clad, around the Great Temple. He wears two white
towels, one over his loins, the other over his neck and shoulder,
leaving the right arm and shoulder bare. He wears simple sandals. The
other pilgrims are of various colors: from white, to yellow, to darkest
black.

177C	--Malcolm and OTHERS walking around the Great Kaaba, a black stone set
in the middle of the Great Mosque. He falls to his knees. WE SEE what
he describes:
MALCOLM'S VOICE
Today, with thousands of others, I proclaimed
God's greatness in the Holy City of Mecca.
Wearing the Ihram garb I made my seven circuits
around the Kaaba; I drank from the well of Zem
Zem; I prayed to Allah from Mt. Ararat where
the Ark landed. It was the only time in my life
that I stood before the Creator of all and felt
like a complete human being.
A TIGHT TWO-SHOT of Malcolm and Betty in an embrace. She breaks from
him and whispers: "Go ahead. I can wait now."

It is a cold winter night. A Molotov cocktail is lit and hurled through
the front picture glass window.
Neighbors' lights have gone on. There are shouts: "What is it?" "Fire!"
"Bring those children in here."
MALCOLM
Call the Fire Department.
186A	OMIT
A hose is playing on the fire. Police cars have arrived. There are TWO
REPORTERS with the COPS. Malcolm faces them furiously.
MALCOLM
And the fire hit the window and it woke up my
second oldest baby, but the fire burned on the
outside of the house. It could have fallen on
six-, four-, or two-year-old girls. And I'm
going to tell you, if it had done it, I'd've
taken my rifle and gone after anybody in sight.
REPORTER
Are the Muslims behind this?
MALCOLM
It was bombed by the Black Muslim movement upon
the orders of Elijah Muhammad.
SECOND REPORTER
Do you know what Muslim headquarters is saying?
MALCOLM
(with total contempt)
I can imagine. I did it myself. For the
publicity.
Bembry is being interviewed by a reporter.
BEMBRY
We feel this is a publicity stunt on the part
of Malcolm X. We hope this isn't a case of "if
he can't keep the house, we won't get it
either."
A car comes roaring down the street with rifles sticking out the
windows, and pulls right up in front of Malcolm's house.
ANGLE - HOUSE
Brothers Earl and Benjamin 2X run out of the car up to Malcolm.
BROTHER EARL
We called your house, operator said you had
requested that your phone be turned off.
BENJAMIN 2X
Give us the command, Malcolm.
MALCOLM
I don't care about myself, my wife and four
children were sleeping in their beds, they
have nothing to do with this.
BROTHER EARL
Let's get out of this cold.
Brothers Earl and Benjamin take off their coats and put it over Malcolm
and lead him to a police car.

Malcolm finally gets out of the car, locks the door and walks a couple
of steps, then stops.
CLOSE - MALCOLM
Malcolm has stopped in his tracks, like some unseen force has overcome
him which prevents him from moving. Malcolm is paralyzed.
CLOSER - MALCOLM'S FACE
His eyes are closed, and the street noise begins to build to a
deafening _roar_. Then all of a sudden it stops.
ANGLE - OLD WOMAN
OLD WOMAN
Son, you all right?
Malcolm opens his eyes, she has brought him out of it. He looks at her
but doesn't answer.
OLD WOMAN (contd)
Are you okay?
Malcolm looks at this old woman, who slightly resembles his own mother.
MALCOLM
Ma'am, I'm fine.
OLD WOMAN
Good. We need you. I recognize you, don't pay
them folks no never mind, you keep on doing
what you doing.
MALCOLM
May Allah bless you.
OLD WOMAN
I'll pray for you too, son. Jesus will protect
you.
She walks away, carrying her two shopping bags full of groceries.
