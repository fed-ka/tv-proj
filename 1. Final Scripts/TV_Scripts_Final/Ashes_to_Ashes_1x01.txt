      EXT. MODERN LONDON - LONDON CITY LANDSCAPE - DAY 1. 083511

    The city. Glass spires. Chrome. Winking lights. Incessant 
      noise. 2008 glory. We SMASH CUT from location to gleaming 
      location.

                                  MOLLY (V.O.)
                          (12 yrs old)
                     My name is Sam Tyler. I had an 
                    accident and I woke up in 1973. Was 
                    I mad? In a coma? Back in time? 
                    Whatever had happened, it was like 
                    I d landed on a different planet. 
                    If I could figure out why I was 
                    here then maybe I could get home 
                    ...  Yeah, whatever. That is so
                    lame.

                                                                            CUT TO:

    She is trying to reach the siren in MOLLY S foot-well.

      ALEX puts her foot down, siren wailing.

      Case file slides on the back seat - photo attached of Sam -

                                                                            CUT TO:          Ashes to Ashes - Episode 1 - Shooting Script: PEACH - 31/08/07           3.


      EXT. TATE MODERN - DAY 1. 084055

      ALEX leaves MOLLY to go in a street behind the looming brick 
      gallery.

                                  ALEX
                    Stay put babes.

                                  MOLLY
                    Mum, don t go ...

                                  ALEX
                    Part of growing up is knowing when 
                    to do what you re told.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. CITY - SOUTH BANK SIDE - DAY 1. 084366

      Hassled OFFICERS keep back a nervous crowd of ON-LOOKERS.

      ARTHUR LAYTON is middle-aged and down at heel with a scar 
      across his left cheek. He has a petrified BUSKER hostage. Gun 
    to her head. 

      ALEX pushes through the ON-LOOKERS. Tate Modern dominates the 
      skyline one side and the gleaming city dominates the other.

                                  POLICE SERGEANT
                    Arthur Layton. He took her money. 
                    She put up a fight. He pulls a 
                    ruddy gun! 

      LAYTON S eyes are constantly searching the concourse - 
      desperate for a means of escape.

      ALEX moves closer.

                                  POLICE SERGEANT (CONT'D)
                    Wait for armed backup.

                                  ALEX
                    Don t need it. 

    She bares her jacket - revealing to LAYTON that she wears no 
      holster. The SARG rolls his eyes - give me strength. 

      MOLLY hurries up. Loiters anxiously at the back of the crowd, 
      unnoticed.

      LAYTON is amazed as ALEX approaches. He s clearly desperate 
    but there s an underlying intelligence in him.

                                  LAYTON
                    Stop! This is my show!

                                  ALEX
                    Arthur? I m DI Alex Drake.

      MOLLY turns at the sound of clattering feet - THREE POLICE 
      MARKSMEN are charging down the concourse carrying state-of-
      the-art rifles.

                                  LAYTON
                    I don t care! Stop staring at me! 

                                  ALEX
                    Let her go and we ll talk.

                                  LAYTON
                    I just wanted cash. You lot turned 
                    this into a three-ringed circus!

                                  ALEX
                    I help people who are trapped. I 
                    help them find an escape route.

      MOLLY panics as she watches the MARKSMEN angling around the 
      crowd to take up position. Laser-sights snapped on.

                                  LAYTON
                    I don t like people staring at me.

                                  ALEX
                    That s fine. I m averting my eyes. 
                    If you let her go, we can 
                    discuss...

                                  LAYTON
                    I ll kill you. Don t doubt it.

      ALEX smiles at LAYTON - it s a smile you can trust.

                                  ALEX 
                    I m not asking you to give up your 
                    hostage. I know that s important to 
                    you. But take me instead.

                                  LAYTON
                    I dunno ... This is my show.

                                  ALEX
                      Absolutely. 

      LAYTON pushes the relieved BUSKER away. Switches the gun to 
      ALEX S face.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Smart move. Good for you Arthur.

    She takes another step closer. 

                                  LAYTON 
                    Wait! I .. I know you! Can t be ... 
                    The last time I saw you, you were 
                    this little girl ... You ve got 
                    your mother s eyes, Alex.

                                  ALEX 
                    You .. You can t have .. You knew 
                    my mother?!

                    What?













































                                                                            (CONTINUED)          Ashes to Ashes - Episode 1 - Shooting Script: PEACH - 31/08/07           5.

    He lunges at ALEX. 

                                  MOLLY
                    MUM!!!

    She comes out of nowhere. Breaking through the cordon before 
    the SERGEANT can reach her.

      MOLLY runs towards ALEX with THE DOTS OF THREE LASER-SITES 
      DANCING ON HER BACK.

                                  ALEX
                    DON T SHOOT!! THERE S A CHILD!!

      Panic. ON-LOOKERS start screaming. A laser site skips across 
      ALEX S face as she reaches for MOLLY.

      Confusion. MARKSMAN S trigger finger itches.

      ALEX reaches to grab MOLLY. Another hand gets there first. 
      LAYTON. He pulls MOLLY to his chest. Backs away towards the 
      river.

    The MARKSMEN don t know what to do. Both LAYTON and MOLLY are 
      smothered in laser light. 

      LAYTON drags MOLLY down the steps towards the riverside 
       beach . The MARKSMEN inch forward. ALEX can t stand it - 
      runs towards the steps just as MOLLY rushes into her arms.

      OFFICERS blaze past them but the beach already seems 
      deserted.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                  MOLLY

    She folds into her mother s arms. ALEX rocks her gently and 
      whispers  sssshhhhhh... 

                                  MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    You could ve got killed in front of

                                  ALEX
                    That was not going to happen.

                                  MOLLY
                          (pushing away)
                    It happened to you when you were my 
                    age! 

                                  ALEX 
                    I told you to stay in the car! It s 
                    a hard, screwed-up world Molly. But 
                    if you learn to trust me, I can 
                    help you get through it.

    She strokes MOLLY S hair.

      A good-looking man in late middle-age walks towards them 
      cautiously. Kind eyes. Expensive clothes. An aura of strength 
    and civility. This is EVAN WHITE.

                                  MOLLY
                    Evan!

    She almost throws herself into his hug.

                                  EVAN
                    It s all right scrap. How about I 
                    get us a cake? A seriously 
                      patronizing chocolate one. Yeah?

    He looks over at ALEX and mouths,  you okay?  She nods with a 
      grateful smile and ushers him on his way. He tips her a wink 
    and leads MOLLY away.

                                  EVAN (CONT'D)
                    I can pretend I know who Shakira is 
                    and you can make fun of me ...

                    Molly! We ll blow those candles out 
                    together. All right?

      MOLLY glances back. ALEX blows her a kiss and MOLLY catches 
    it.

    He puts his hand supportively on MOLLY as they walk away 
      along the walkway. ALEX feels like shit.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      I/E. ALEX S CAR - TATE MODERN - DAY 1. 085488

      ALEX drops into the driver s seat. Places a mobile call.

                                  ALEX
                    DIAlex Drake, clearance Delta-one-
                    six. Put me through to the 
                    Superintendent. 

    She waits and waits - playing thoughts over in her mind.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                          (soft singing)
                    I m happy. Hope you re happy too ..

      LAYTON sits up in the back seat and rests his gun against the 
      back of her neck. He puts on reflective sunglasses.

                                  LAYTON
                    Start the car.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. THAMES - RIVER BOAT - DAY 1. 090499

      LAYTON pushes ALEX along a rusted gangplank towards the 
      flaking hulk. The horizon across the river is dominated by 
    the Millennium Dome. 

                                  LAYTON
                    You re my ticket out, Alex. 
                          (using her mobile)
                    Hello, remember me? Layton ... Yeah 
                    ... I got a piece of your past here 
                    so you re gonna have to listen ... 
                    Tim and Caroline Price s daughter. 

                                  ALEX
                    How did you know my parents?!

                                  LAYTON
                    And I m gonna tell her the truth 
                    about how they died .. And your 
                    life ll be in ashes mate ... So now 
                    we talk about how you get me out of 
                    this mess. Think about it.

    He clicks off the phone and drags her inside. The boat is 
      called  Di . 

                                                                            CUT TO:          Ashes to Ashes - Episode 1 - Shooting Script: PEACH - 31/08/07           8.


      INT. RIVER BOAT - DAY 1. 09051010

      They enter the dank. Leaking vessel.

                                  ALEX
                    I m on your side Arthur. Those 
                    officers were itching for a 
                    Fatality Outcome ...

                                  LAYTON
                    I used to be somebody.

                                  ALEX
                    Who did you call? What could my 
                    parents have to do with this? 
                    They ve been dead a long time. 

                                  LAYTON
                    I had an empire going, back in the 
                    day. Dealers on every corner. 
                    Coppers in my back pocket.

                                  ALEX
                    So things went wrong. Do you want 
                    to talk about that? You feel 
                    trapped. I understand. Let me help 
                    you.

      LAYTON smiles. Cruel turn of the mouth. Sounds of water 
      slapping incessantly against the hull.

      Phone rings. LAYTON snaps it open. Listens. His smile falls - 
      this is bad news.

                                  LAYTON
                    Okay .. That s a pity ... hmmmm.. 
                    Right.

      ALEX watches his gun hand drop limply. She senses a 
      resolution. Moves forward.

                                  ALEX
                    It s over. Give me ...

                                  LAYTON
                    Fine ...

    AND HE LIFTS HIS GUN AND SHOOTS HER IN THE HEAD.

    She sees it! Sees the BULLET COMING TOWARDS HER. Has that 
      moment to comprehend her fate. A micro-second before the 
      bullet hits her -

                                                                        SMASH CUT:        Ashes to Ashes - Episode 1 - Shooting Script: PEACH - 31/08/07           8A.

      INT. RIVER BOAT - BROTHEL - DAY 1. 09151717

      ALEX jolts awake. Wearing a short red skirt, white blouse 
      with puff sleeves and with her hair lacquered to within an 
      inch of its life. 

      Panicky, she feels her face - is she bleeding?

      Around her, New Romantic music fills the boat which is now 
      decked in red and white satin. End of an all-nighter.
      Ultravox bounces off the walls. Garish HOOKERS dance with 
      YOUNG MEN in silvery suits. The whole atmosphere is one of 
      decadence and youthful abandon. Even the HOOKERS look like 
      they might be having a good time. 

      ALEX staggers to her feet. A GUY in a pastel shirt tries to 
      grope her and she shoves him away.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. RIVER BOAT - THAMES - DAY 1. 09161818

      Ultravox swells. ALEX runs out of the boat, now called  The 
      Lady Di.  

      There is no Millennium Dome to dominate the skyline.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        Ashes to Ashes - Episode 1 - Shooting Script: PEACH - 31/08/07           10.

      UNIFORM OFFICERS push past her, raiding the boat. The fashion 
    of their uniforms fractionally different from today.

                                  ALEX
                    Help me, I ve been shot ..

    She is ignored.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. STREET - DAY 1. 09171919

      ALEX runs into the alley. The area has quickly turned into a 
      rabbit warren of shadows and looming warehouses.

      Poster on the wall advertises Adam Ant s new album.Adam 
      Ant s arms are crossed in defiance.

      ALEX fingers her red clothes, noticing them for the first 
      time. What the hell ..?

      Into the street charges EDWARD MARKHAM. He has been one of 
    the punters in the brothel. Brash. Young. Bouffant highlights 
      that bounce as he moves. Striped shirt under an expensive 
      jacket. Coke powder around his nose. Harrow school in manner 
    and accent.

                                  MARKHAM
                    Did you call them in you evil 
                    little tart?

                                  ALEX
                    What?!

    He pushes her against the wall. She is too shell-shocked to 
      resist.

                                  MARKHAM 
                    You ll regret that sweetie.

      Cue: Rolling drums. Banshee war-cry. Adam And The Ants - 
       Prince Charming .

    An AudiQuattro screams into the alley. Heads directly 
      towards a stack of dustbins.At the last second it swerves to 
      avoid them. Brakes inches from ALEX and MARKHAM.

      Three men emerge. DS RAY CARLING - pink Fred Perry t-shirt, 
      aviators. DC CHRIS SKELTON - two-tone drainpipes and a wedgie 
      haircut. 

      DETECTIVE CHIEF INSPECTOR GENE HUNT - silvery grey suit over 
      a crisp white shirt. Tie hung low and sulky. 

       Don t you ever? Don t you ever? Stop being dandy showing us 
      you re handsome? 

    All three draw whopping great Magnums.

    She tries to stand. Her legs buckle. She is weak and 
      vulnerable and he takes a gruff pity on her. Scoops her up in 
    his arms. Looks at her in his grip - she is rather beautiful. 
    And in a swoon. He likes them like that.

    He wrests the phone from her hand. They tussle. Until ALEX *
      spots something on the desk. She gasps and sinks to her 
      knees. To RAY and CHRIS it looks like she is going down on 
    the Guv.VIV chuckles.

                    God, I love toms.

      ALEX stares at the little plaque on the desk - DIDrake.

      ALEX crawls back against the far wall. She clutches her head 
    and fights the rising tide of sheer panic. They watch her. 
      GENE drags her to her feet.

                    Come on ...

      A warrant card falls from her coat. He picks it up. Studies 
    it without reacting. Passes it back to her.

      ALEX faces the department, stoic and shocked. The room is 
      awash in sweaty testosterone, fag smoke and menace.

      INT. CITY STATION - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 1. 10502727

    RAY opposite MARKHAM and his BRIEF. ALEX stands by the door 
      looking dazed. She clutches a set of files which she has been 
      handed - fingers through them distractedly.

      GENE enters with ERIC, a scrawny, twisted young man with 
      hollow eyes.

                                  GENE
                    I assume you two know each other. 
                    Of course you do. This is Eric 
                    Phelps. He s one of your clients, 
                    Mr Markham. What? Don t say you ve 
                    never met. Then again, you are at 
                    opposite ends of the chain.

                                  MARKHAM
                          (to LAWYER)

                                  GENE 
                    Eric had a trial for the Hammers, 
                    didn t you Eric. But the old drugs 
                    took their toll and he lost his 
                    place in the squad. He used to 
                    dream of playing for West Ham. Now 
                    he drops his pants and takes it up 
                    the Bakerloofor a day s worth of 
                    gear. Off you pop son.

      ERIC is taken outside.

    The BRIEF goes to speak but MARKHAM silences him.

                    Take no notice of the Sergeant.

                    He s upset. His old mum s very ill 
                    in hospital.

    RAY - what???

                    Yeah. I m .. God, hope she pulls 
                    through.

      ALEX picks a photo out of the file that hits her like a bolt

                    I was shot. The result of that act 
                    was my arrival in this .. this 
                    dystopia. 

    She scrawls Dystopia on the board.

                                  CHRIS
                    Dystopia. I had that once. Couldn t

                    My mind creates a dark, twisted 
                    place for me to go to. My brain is 
                    in severe trauma so it will not 
                    expend unnecessary energy creating 
                    people I don t need. Therefore 
                      everythinghere is significant.

                    Now, I am an empirical person. I

                    must constantly analyze. 

    She writes Analysis at all times.

      CHRIS nudges SHAZ - well done. Then it dawns him he hasn t 
    the first idea what s going on.

                    The moment it happened, I saw the 
                    bullet and I thought  this is it

                    Where does this leave me?

    She steps back from the board. Each line of writing is under 
    the previous line. And thus the capital letters of each 
      sentence spell - D - E - A - D. 

      ALEX begins to perspire. Her breathing jags. She can t take 
    her eyes off those four letters. She picks up the Betamax
      casette labelled LAYTON.

                    We put crime squad onto Markham 
                    like you said. He made nine

                    He then picked up a message from

      ALEX barges the door open and walks through the yard. LAYTON 
    is shining up an antique sabre. He glances up.

                                  ALEX
                    I m going to stop you, you bastard!

                    I m not afraid. Are you? 

    He heads towards his shop, allowing the sabre to scrape 
      horribly along the hard stone ground. 

                                  LAYTON (CONT D)
                    You should be Miss Drake. There s a

                    But who s gonnaget you, in the 
                    end?

    He slams the shop door on her. Gone. She backs away. And it 
    is then that she notices a tatty notebook sitting beside 
      Layton s chair in the yard. She picks it up and flicks 
      through it - lists of numbers - 0527 / 1844.

      Something moves in the corner of ALEX s eye. She turns with a 
      start: the ASHES CLOWN?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ALEX steps into the deserted street. The ASHES CLOWN stands 
      fifty yards away. Fixed. Still. Looking at her. 

    And then quite suddenly he starts to run full pelt towards 
      her. ALEX turns and flees in panic. The CLOWN is gaining.

      Fury seizes her. She stops and whirls to face him.

                                  ALEX
                    Go AWAY!

    But the street is empty again. ALEX suddenly hates this 
      place. Hates this bloody red skirt. She starts tearing at it 
      angrily.

      Trestle tables covered in plastic checked table-cloths. CID

      from the sound system. LUIGI is a tired-looking man. He

      GENE swigs his lager. He remains somberly on the periphery. 

      ALEX walks in. She has put on the clothes Shaz gave her and 
      looks fabulous in jeans and a white leather jacket. GENE 
      knows two things in that moment - one: he must shag her 
      brains out. Two: he never will.

      GENE pours her a glass of wine. She takes a sip. Shudders.

                                  GENE

                    I think it dripped off the house.

    He finds this funny. She has to smile - a tired, oh shit 
      smile. She drains the glass and waits for another.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    No time for that. I have to nail 
                    Layton now. Crime squad gave us the

      Fiesta by some nasty looking GEEZERS crammed into suits. 
      MARKHAM is with them, standing out a mile in pastel shades 
    and highlights.

    men carry machine-guns.

      activity amongst the drug-dealers.

                                  ALEX 
                    I need Layton alive. Understand? I

      EXT. THAMES - QUAY - DAY 3. 12357474

      GENE watches from hiding. A big car draws up. MARKHAM goes to 
    the window which glides down in anticipation. MARKHAM talks 
    to the hidden man within the car.

      MARKHAM beckons a COHORT who brings SHAZ into view. SHAZ is 
      dishevelled and trembling. 

      CHRIS S blood boils. He goes to step out, gun raised. GENE 
      holds him back.

      MARKHAM cracks open a crate and removes a kilo bag. Passes it 
      into the car. Laughter from the man within the car. He steps 
      out. We see it s LAYTON, looking every inch the 80 sdrug 
      dealer in his sub-Miami Vice suit.

      GENE S eyes burn with a hellish indignation. 

      MARKHAM is really enjoying himself. His GANG congregate 
      around the coke crate, laughing and pushing each other. SHAZ 
    is ignored.

                                  CHRIS

      EXT. THAMES - FURTHER ALONG THE BANK - DAY 3. 12367575

      ALEX and the other OFFICERS hear the distant report of gun-
      fire further down the bank. This is it! ALEX follows the 
      action through her binocs.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. THAMES - DOCKS - DAY 3. 12377676

      GENE and RAY are pinned down.

      CHRIS can see MARKHAM moving back near to SHAZ. CHRIS makes a 
      break for it, bullets snapping at his heels. He dives behind 
      a second concrete stack. It s no use, he can t get close 
      enough.

      LAYTON suddenly grabs SHAZ as hostage. He pulls her towards 
    his car as the others get in.

      GENE sees this. Stands up and SHOOTS THE CAR. THE BONNET 
      FLIES UP IN A BURST OF SMOKE AND FLAMES. The GANG MEMBERS
      scatter, throwing their guns aside.

                    B-Team to A-Team. Do you read me?

      ALEX starts off along the quay-side. Alone. 

    She comes face to face with LAYTON and SHAZ! LAYTON draws 
      SHAZ to him and puts the gun to her head.

      LAYTON pushes SHAZ away. 

      GENE opens fire. RAY and CHRIS follow suit.

    THE TOW-PATH EXPLODES WITH BULLETS THAT PICK AT THE GROUND.

      ALEX dives back and covers SHAZ with her own body. A bullet 
      ricochets into LAYTON S face. He grabs his bloody cheek and 
      falls to the ground.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        Ashes to Ashes - Episode 1 - Shooting Script: PEACH - 31/08/07           57.

      ALEX crawls to him. Cuffs him. LAYTON is dazed and bleeding 
    but relatively unhurt.

    She looks to the sky. Nothing. ALEX sags - utterly drained. 
    She realizes that LAYTON is staring at her with dark boiling 
      hatred.

      GENE, RAY and CHRIS jump get out of the boat. CHRIS catches 
      sight of MARKHAM trying to leg it away from the river. CHRIS 
      gives chase.

    The drug GANG are bundled into Rover Squad cars, including a

    She suddenly hugs him fit to bust.

    RAY looks over and sees GENE and ALEX walking towards them. 
    Two cops - stride for stride. GENE has the machine-gun slung 
      Dirty Dozen style over his shoulder. ALEX lets her pistol

      RAY, CHRIS and SHAZ watch them and they can all see it - the 
      spark between GENE HUNT and ALEX DRAKE.

                    Go to sleep.

    She lets go of the radio as thought it s hot.

                                  ALEX
                          (hope)
                    Molly?

      ALEX looks up - there is the ASHES CLOWN on her TV set, 
      speaking with Molly s voice.

                                  ASHES CLOWN  (TV)
                    You ve just been shot. A second 
                    ago.

                    You re lying on the wet ground. 
                    Don t fight to wake up. It ll hurt 
                    too much.

    On TV - a birthday cake. MOLLY stares at the cake.

                                  ASHES CLOWN (CONT'D)
                    You ll never make it to her party.

                                  ALEX
                    Oh Molly ... I m so sorry ....

                                  ASHES CLOWN (TV) 
                    All those memories ...

    On TV - the Ford escort explodes in a fire-ball.

                                  ALEX
                    Mummy ... Dad ....

    On TV - back to the ASHES CLOWN.

                                  ASHES CLOWN
                    But it doesn t have to hurt.

    She crawls towards the CLOWN. Towards the TV. As she does, 
    the room around her begins to dim. Her breathing slows. Her 
      eyes lose their lustre.

      Then suddenly ALEX gets a grip of herself - she reaches out 
    and pulls the plug. The TV dies. She grabs her newly acquired  
      dictaphoneand paces with angry determination.

                                  ALEX 
                          (records)
                    My name is Alex Drake. I ve just 
                    been shot and that bullet has sent 
                    me to 1981. I may be one second 
                    away from life ...

      FLASH - MOLLY S smiling face.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Or one second away from death.

                    Well bring them on. My life can 
                    flash away as much as it likes. I 
                    am not going to die. I m going to

    She blows a kiss into the air.

      Music wafting up from the trattoria below - John Lennon - 
       Imagine .

       Imagine there s no Heaven. It s easy if you try. No Hell 
      below us. Above us only sky. Imagine all the people, living 
    for today ... 

                                                                            MIX TO:

       Imagine  continues. ALEX comes downstairs.

    RAY is chatting up a BIRD. Other CID drinking and eating 
      spaghetti. LUIGI (knackered) cups his chin in his palms. 

    We pick out CHRIS and SHAZ sharing a quiet drink. Finding the 
      courage to look into each other s eyes.

       Imagine there s no countries. It isn t hard to do. Nothing 
    to kill or die for. And no religion too. Imagine all the 
      people, living life in peace ... 

                                                                            MIX TO:

      INT. CITY STATION - CID - GENE S OFFICE - NIGHT 3. 00048484

      GENE - a lonely figure under a solitary lamp. Gun, holster, 
      tie, Kourosand ciggies splayed across the desk before him. 
    He looks at the picture of Sam on his bulletin board. Then 
      grabs his jacket.

       You may say I m a dreamer. But I m not the only one ...

                                                                            MIX TO:

      A wine glass is plonked before her and filled to the very 
      brim.

     I hope some day you will join us and the world will be as 
    one ... 

    She raises her head. GENE carries the bottle to another 
      table. Doesn t look back but she appreciates the gesture.

      FADE OUT.
