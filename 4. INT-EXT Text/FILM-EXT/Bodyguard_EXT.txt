Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a TV showroom.
Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all
the TV sets are showing the same picture, the glittering
image of a woman singing. (We will recognize the woman
as Rachel Marron.) We cut tighter and tighter on the
image until it is almost broken up into its scanning
lines. Through the city noise comes the sound of her
song "I have Nothing."
2A

A tumultuous crash of screaming, pushing bodies. Arms
stretch out, cameras flash, sunguns flare, microphones
are thrust forward. A deafening cacophony of "Rachel!
Rachel! Rachel! Over here! Over here! This way,
Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" We cannot see the object of
this frenzy. We catch a brief glimpse of an attractive,
well-dressed young woman (NICKI), exiting with the other
celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside
by the mass of surging fans and media. Her face is calm
and impassive as she watches from the sidelines.

7
A blur of hands and faces. Excited fans. Pieces of paper,
autograph books, notes are thrust forward INTO the CAMERA.
Again, a mass chanting "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!"
Hands of Rachel's entourage accept some of the proffered
items.
In CLOSEUP, we see Rachel's hands signing "Best wishes,
4.
Rachel Marron" on an out-stretched open palm. In the
midst of the urgent forest of hands and paper, a be-
ribboned black doll is thrust forward, bearing the legend
"RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU."

SLAM of a CAR DOOR. Frank gets out of a cab with two
suitcases. His house is a modest stucco affair on a
small lot. He goes up the walk and puts down his suit-
cases. He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass.
Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep. He picks up a
few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket. A
curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain. As the
door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail
inside. Frank's feet push the letters aside and go
inside. The door shuts.
10
12
Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun-
glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side. Strains of
"DON'T WALK AWAY RENEE" come from a beat-up transistor
RADIO.
An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back
and forth over the freshly cut grass.
Throwing knives
lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is
sticking out of
the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard.
BILL DEVANEY, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black
gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a
conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well.
He's Rachel's personal manager.
DEVANEY
So, you won't protect Rachel Marron
just because she's in show business?
FRANK
I don't do celebrities.
DEVANEY
But the biggest money's in show
business people.
Frank says nothing. His
eyes are
closed behind the sun-
glasses. Devaney picks
up one of
the throwing knives.
He holds it carefully by the blade
and throws it. It
misses the post by three feet and
clatters against the
fence.
Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his
eyes again.
DEVANEY
(picking up another
knife)
Do you really do these things?
FRANK
Isn't she the one who collects
dolls?
This is enough to distract Devaney from his knife-throwing.
DEVANEY
(exasperated)
Farmer, Rachel Marron is one of the
most famous people in America. She's
won every music award invented. She's
got the number one song in the country
right now and she'll probably be
nominated for an Oscar in her very
6.
first picture. And you want to know
'Isn't she the one...?' Christ,
man, where've you been?
FRANK
You mean she doesn't collect dolls?
DEVANEY
(defeated)
Yes.
She collects dolls.
FRANK
I thought I knew who she was.
Devaney tries to size up whether Frank is kidding him or
not. Frank's face betrays nothing. Devaney gestures with
a knife.
DEVANEY
You're probably deadly with these
things, aren't you?
FRANK
Deadly.
DEVANEY
Show me.
Frank doesn't move.
DEVANEY
Why are you resisting this job?
$2,000 bucks a week.
(no response)
$2,500.
FRANK
There are several good men
available for that kind of money.
Have you talked to Fitzgerald or
Racine? Portman?
DEVANEY
Yeah.
Portman was interested...
He senses an opening and sits down beside Frank for what
he takes to be the first serious talk.
DEVANEY
... but we're told you're the best.
FRANK
There's no such thing.
DEVANEY
Farmer, we're talking about a
very frightened lady. With a
7.
seven-year old son. Believe me,
I wouldn't be here if I didn't
think this was for real.
(long pause)
Farmer, she begged me to get you.
Frank sits up finally and looks at Devaney a long time.
He picks up five throwing knives and stands up.
FRANK
All right. I'll come and I'll look
the situation over. If I take it,
it's three thousand a week.
DEVANEY
(whistles)
Okay. You must be very deadly
for three grand a week.
Frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post.
He
throws one of the knives. It misses the post and
clatters against the fence.
FRANK
Shit.
Devaney's face drops.
Frank examines the next knife.
FRANK
(mumbling)
I know it's something like...
The second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc
and disappears into some bushes about three feet from
Devaney. Devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind
Frank.
FRANK
Sorry.
Frank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and
motions Devaney off to the side.
FRANK
Better not stand right behind me.
Devaney smiles weakly. Frank lets the third knife go
with one smooth motion.
The knife sinks an inch into the center of the post.
THUMP.
Frank's hand arching again.
Throwing the remaining knives.
Both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical
line with the first one.

Frank stops his nondescript Chevy across the quiet street
from the closed, unmanned gate at the bottom of the Marron
driveway.
FRANK'S POV
as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation
and the rising grounds beyond.
(NOTE: The use of the term FRANK'S POV, is not to be
taken simply as a camera direction. Rather, it re-
presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in
the special way Frank sees. Frank lives by constant
vigilance, heightened awareness. It is his genius and
his burden. The audience must be put in the position of
looking, searching, scanning with him.)
He has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick-
ling on the back of his neck. As he looks around, a
black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives
rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look. He watches
it go.
Frank pulls up
to the gate and gets out of his car. He
grabs a bar of
the gate and pulls. The whole gate
rattles. Frank
gets back in his car and pushes a button
on the intercom
box at the side of the gate. A MAN'S
VOICE CRACKLES
out of the BOX. Transmission is terrible.
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
Yes?
FRANK
Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
What?
FRANK
Alexander Graham Bell to see Miss
Marron!
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
(obviously has not heard)
Have you got an appointment?
FRANK
The atomic number of zinc is 30.
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
All right.
There is a LOUD BUZZING and the gate swings arthritically
open.

FRANK'S POV
as he moves up the winding drive through heavily land-
scaped grounds. Plenty of potential hiding places. The
mansion is at the top of the hill. The grounds behind
the mansion fall away.
15
15
The mansion is huge. On and on it goes. Frank drives
PAST the garage area where HENRY, the chauffeur, is
polishing the mascot on the limousine. One of his arms
is bandaged. Henry peers at Frank, puts down his cloth
and walks toward the entrance where Frank is parking.
Frank gets out, looks around. A painter's truck is
parked nearby, two painters unloading equipment from it.
HENRY
Can I help you?
FRANK
Are you the man on the intercom?
HENRY
No.
Can I help you?
FRANK
My name is Edison. I have an
appointment with Miss Marron.
HENRY
Oh.
And that was arranged by...?
FRANK
(impressed)
Mr. Devaney.
HENRY
Go right ahead, Mr. Edison.
FRANK
What happened to your arm?
HENRY
(looking at his arm)
A doll.
He goes back to the limousine.
Frank RINGS the DOORBELL, although the door is not shut.
EMMA, a fiftyish housekeeper, appears. A man in cover-
alls comes out past her, carrying a length of timber.
10.
FRANK
Henry Ford, to see Mr. Devaney.
EMMA
Come in, please.
16
20
Frank is walking rapidly away from the window wall, down
the slope. Devaney is scurrying to keep up.
DEVANEY
Farmer, will you wait a minute? I
should have told you more. I'm
sorry but I was afraid she wouldn't
go through with it. I thought I'd
let the two of you work it out...
come to an understanding.
FRANK
We did.
Frank starts to walk off.
Devaney is grasping at straws.
DEVANEY
She's not a bad person, and whether
she knows it or not, she needs you.
(a beat)
You've come this far... Would you
just wait here for one minute. I
want to show you something. Please,
Farmer.
Devaney runs back to the house.
21
21
Fletcher, happy to have someone to talk to,
walks up to
Frank with his remote-control speed boat.
Frank would
like to walk away, but Fletcher blocks his
way. Frank
looks at Fletcher's frail little, nut-brown
figure. The
watching nanny continues her embroidering,
some way off.
FLETCHER
Hi!
FRANK
(continuing to walk)
Hi.
FLETCHER
How are you today?
FRANK
(wants to keep walking)
All right. How 'bout yourself?
FLETCHER
Oh, I'm fine. Do you like boats?
19.
Frank gives up.
He's not going to get out of here.
He
stops.
FRANK
No.
I don't like boats.
FLETCHER
You don't!
Why not?
FRANK
Oh, I don't know.
FLETCHER
Sure you do, but you don't want
to tell me.
Frank considers him, then slips out of his sport coat.
He crouches down so that he is eye-level with Fletcher.
FRANK
You're a smart kid.
Fletcher nods.
FRANK
I'll tell you. One time I was
stuck on a boat with some people
for four months.
FLETCHER
A lifeboat?
FRANK
Nope. A big white yacht.
Do you
know what a yacht is?
FLETCHER
(thinks about this)
Yeah.
My mom rented this huge
yacht
once, and we took a trip.
It was
great. Everyone threw up
except
me. I love 'em.
FRANK
(standing to leave)
Well, nobody's perfect.
Fletcher squints up at him, the sun in his eyes.
FLETCHER
You're the bodyguard, aren't you?
Frank is surprised.
FRANK
What do you know about it?
20.
FLETCHER
I've got ears.
FRANK
I'll remember that.
Devaney trots into the pool area, out of breath. He is
holding a bulging manila file. As he sees Fletcher, he
holds the file casually at his side.
Frank sees Fletcher looking at the file.
DEVANEY
How are you, Fletch?
(to Frank)
I'm glad you waited.
Let's go
over here.
FRANK
(to Fletcher)
Nice meeting you.
Fletcher looks after them silently.
22
22
Devaney slides the file across the table at Frank, open-
ing it. Inside are letters of every size and condition.
Repeatedly throughout this scene Frank's gaze is drawn to
Fletcher, who has started his boat again.
DEVANEY
This is just in the last six months.
FRANK
(looks at the pile)
Have you ever tried having these
professionally assessed?
Devaney shakes his head no.
Frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by
the corner of the page. From many different sources, some
are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts.
Many are soiled and torn, others immaculate. Occasionally,
one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it.
Spector enters sucking on a popsicle. He comes to stand
over Frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles
of letters.
SPECTOR
Devaney says you were in the Secret
Service.
Frank nods.
21.
Frank goes through them quickly, with an expert eye. He
sometimes pauses to read one more carefully. A few he
removes from the stack and places in the center of the
table.
SPECTOR
Ever guard the main man?
FRANK
I was two years with Carter and
four years with Reagan.
Frank sets another letter in the center pile.
He stops,
smiling at it.
FRANK
This is a little old lady in
Akron. She's written to
everybody I've ever worked for.
He continues to turn until something stops him. Several
letters are paper-clipped together. They are the pasted-
up type we saw being assembled on the desk top.
SPECTOR
Reagan got shot.
His chatter is beginning to annoy Frank.
FRANK
Not on my shift.
Spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke.
SPECTOR
That's good.
Frank goes back to his letters.
He taps the stack in
the center of the table.
FRANK
At first glance, these don't
bother me. But keep them. You
never know.
He separates one letter from the others.
FRANK
This could be something.
Devaney searches Frank's face.
DEVANEY
You think it could be the same
guy? The one who rigged the doll?
22.
FRANK
I don't know. Did you tell Miss
Marron about it? Does she know
about the doll?
Devaney and Spector exchange looks.
This is evidently a
sore point between them.
SPECTOR
We said there'd been some electrical
problem while she was on stage.
Short circuit. Look, she doesn't
need that kind of worry right now.
It would upset her.
FRANK
What about the police?
SPECTOR
There was no reason for the police.
No one got hurt.
FRANK
What about the chauffeur?
SPECTOR
It was nothing. It was just our
people there.
Frank turns and watches Fletcher by the pool.
Devaney's
eyes are still on Frank's face.
DEVANEY
Sy, I think we should show him
the room.
23
24
Frank emerges with Devaney and crosses toward his car.
DEVANEY
...She won't give you any static,
Frank, you've got my word on that.
Frank is still focused on Fletcher.
FRANK
Sure she will.
DEVANEY
So what job's perfect? You're
a bodyguard, aren't you?
Slowly, Frank faces him.
FRANK
(quietly)
Yeah.
As they reach the car, Devaney is relieved.
He dares a
perfect smile.
FRANK
Devaney, if you ever lie to me
again, I'll take you apart.
25.
25
26
The fortification of the estate begins as Frank and
Henry walk the grounds. Frank talks and points, Henry
takes notes on a pad. Frank gestures at the stonework
of the gate, points at the top of the stone wall along
Waverly Lane. At the tall hedges which separate the
estate from its neighbors, Frank gestures to take in
the entire length of the hedged border. Henry stops
in amazement. Frank keeps walking.
27
27
27.
Fletcher stands at the edge of the terrace, staring down
across the rear grounds.
FLETCHER'S POV
Frank and Henry are down there conferring about the
fence.
RACHEL
appears beside Fletcher, looks down there too, then leads
her son purposefully away. Fletcher isn't happy about it.
28
30
Frank and Henry walk toward the closed garages.
HENRY
That depends on what you call a
'hint.'
FRANK
I don't want anyone on the street
to be able to look at the cars and
know who owns them.
Henry leans in a doorway and hits a master switch. The
three doors of the garage start to rise in sequence.
HENRY
I don't think there's anything
here you'd call a 'hint.'
One at a time the doors go up to reveal:
First garage -- the Cadillac limousine we've seen earlier.
License: RACHEL 2
Second garage -- a gray Mercedes.
License:
RACHEL 3
29.
Third garage -- a Jaguar XKE in an outrageous pink. No
other car in the world is this color. License: RACHEL 1
Frank looks at Henry, who is laughing and shakes his head.
He walks toward the Jag.
Frank releases the hood. He looks inside for a moment,
then reaches into the guts of the engine. He fiddles for
a second, then stands up holding some wires and slams the
hood shut again. He gestures toward the other two cars.
FRANK
Get new plates for those two.
31
31
The fortification continues as workmen use a bulldozer to
clear away the stonework around the entrance.
32
32
Sitting beside Henry, Frank teaches him how to spin the
limo in a 180 degree 'skid turn,' sending up clouds of
dust. A group of roadies watching bursts into spontan-
eous applause.
33
33
Fletcher sits on the grass about halfway to the house,
watching the activity with delighted interest.
He turns as he spots something beyond the hedge.
FLETCHER'S POV
Workmen put up a seven-foot cyclone fence. Across the
road, a black Toyota 4 X 4 is stopped. It slowly pulls
away. We can't see inside it.
34
34
One worker pries a small boulder out of a hole with a
crowbar. His partner picks up the rock and tosses it
on a small pile of rocks. The boulder bounces down the
backside of the pile.
35
39
Rachel attracts the usual stares from passersby. As
they reach the limousine, Frank continues scanning the
street. Tony stares at him, uncomprehending.
TONY
(impatiently)
Hey, let's go.
Frank takes a last look then gets into the front seat
next to Tony.
FRANK
(across Tony)
O.K. Henry, let's go.
Tony looks at Frank, eyes narrowing.
From across the street, we see the limo pull away. As
the shot clears, the dark shape of another vehicle
appears, slowly moving into frame over the top of the
camera.
40
41
The limo enters the gate where workmen are rigging a
large fence.
42
43
As Frank comes through some bushes, he suddenly catches a
glimpse of the 4 X 4 through the trees. It starts to
accelerate.
As it pulls away (it is too far to record the license
number), he breaks into a full run toward the other end
of the property.
Leaping hedges, Frank crashes through tropical vegetation.
CRASHING through a bamboo forest, he scurries down a
steep wooded slope toward the road below. The 4 X 4 can
be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off.
36.
A retaining wall about
14 feet high rises from the road
to the slope. Without
a pause, as the car speeds beneath,
Frank leaps and drops
the full distance to the road. The
4 X 4 ROARS PAST just
missing him and turns a corner.
Hitting hard, Frank allows his knees to take the force of
the fall, deliberately rolling once before he springs
into a crouched upright position.
But the 4 X 4 speeds around a corner and is gone.
44
45
Rachel has been watching Fletcher and Frank down the
hill. Now she leans back on the chaise lounge where
she is sunning, trying to listen to a new song on a
Walkman.
There is the SCREECHING howl of a DRILL on METAL from
the direction of the house. Rachel jumps up and yells
toward the house.
RACHEL
Shut up you assholes!
46
47
In a BIG CLOSEUP ON a black and white TV screen, we see
Devaney's immaculate convertible Mercedes 500SL as it
roars up the drive. Frank, Henry and Fletcher watch in
the newly-erected guard house. The area is greatly
changed. There is a uniformed guard with an impressive
array of switches, lights and phones at his command.
There are several TV screens; one of them shows a series
of endlessly-panning shots from cameras at the rear of
38.
the grounds. On the other, the Mercedes kicks up dust
from the last few curves in the drive. Fletcher shakes
his head. He's seen it all before.
HENRY
Is that Devaney?
FLETCHER
(to Frank)
She's got him by the short ones,
doesn't she, Frank?
Frank squelches a smile at Henry.
Where did he learn
that?
FRANK
Yeah, she makes him nervous.
They watch as Devaney SCREECHES to a STOP, gets out and
hurries inside.
48
48A
Rachel's limousine is parked opposite the shop.
It's
a decidedly downscale area. A little way
off, a
group
of unemployed youths hang around, eyeing the limo
with
interest. Henry sits
at the wheel. Tony
stands
by the
open window, leaning against the car.
HENRY
(looking at the
youths)
I wish Rachel didn't keep coming
here. It makes me nervous.
TONY
Me too. 'Cept I'm not nervous
'cos I got you with me.
49
51
Rachel's SONG PLAYS OVER the moonlit estate.
52
53
Frank is showing Henry how to check the underside of the
limo with an angled mirror on a stick. Both are crouched
beside the vehicle. A noise makes them look up. Rachel,
dressed to the nines and looking very sexy, emerges from
the house with Spector and Devaney. Spector's carrying a
videotape. Tony follows as they head for the car, where
45.
Frank and Henry are waiting. Fletcher stands in the
doorway, flanked by uniformed security guards. He waves
at Frank.
FRANK
(to Henry)
I thought it was dinner.
Henry shrugs.
FRANK
(to Spector)
Are we going somewhere else?
SPECTOR
The Mayan, Frank.
FRANK
What's the Mayan?
Spector starts to climb into the limo.
SPECTOR
It's a club, Frank. Come on,
Henry, let's go.
FRANK
Spector, you've got to tell me
about these things.
SPECTOR
I just did.
He disappears inside the limo.
Rachel tugs at Frank's lapels, looks him up and down,
brushing something off his shoulder. Frank's annoyed.
RACHEL
Nice suit, Frank.
Rachel is about to get in.
FRANK
Rachel.
He removes something from his pocket, a small enameled
cross.
FRANK
I want you to keep this.
Rachel looks at it, both flattered and confused.
RACHEL
For me?
It's beautiful.
46.
FRANK
It's fitted with a radio
transmitter. When you close the
clasp, it sends a signal. If
there's ever a problem and we're
separated, just press it and I'll
know you need me.
Rachel doesn't know how to respond. She's stuck for
words. Spector pokes his head out impatiently.
SPECTOR
Okay, she knows how it works,
let's get going.
Rachel manages a quick smile to Frank as she gets in the
back. Frank gets in the front beside Tony. The limo
pulls out.
54
55
The mob reacts to the sight of the approaching limo which
turns into the parking area and heads for the backstage.
Faces of the fans are at the windows leering at Rachel.
Many are grotesquely painted. Some go into a wild frenzy
as Rachel's limo pulls up. There is a punch-up and a man
is beaten back. Someone has a video camera. Its quartz
light shines in through the limo windows. Everybody
squints at the glare.
56
56
As Rachel's car pulls up, the beaten man dances weirdly
at the curb with blood streaming from his nose.
A pair of security guards try to hold them back.
As her
limo stops, a chant begins.
CROWD
Rachel!
Rachel! We want Rachel!
Others join in as the mob presses forward.
The instant she exits the car, her expression goes public
-- a wide, show-biz smile. Sandwiched between Spector and
Devaney, with Tony in front and Frank at the rear, Rachel
makes her entrance.
A young man breaks the barrier
moving toward Rachel.
Frank grabs him by one of his
belt loops, gracefully
guides him all the way across
and slips him under the
opposite cordon into the arms
of a security guard.
57
63A
Rachel's limo stands waiting. CAMERA PULLS BACK to
reveal a black Toyota 4 X 4 parked among the other cars.
63B
67
Tony bursts out the front door and begins cutting a
swath through the crowd. Rain beats down.
TONY
Make way here. Outta the way!
A burly street regular gets a shove from Tony and comes
back hard. The
crowd immediately sides with him, yells
encouragement.
But Tony is the better man and sends him
sprawling. The
rest of the way to the curb opens up.
At the parking area Tony discovers there is no limo and
turns in bewilderment to Rachel. But she is not there.
A couple of people laugh.
68
68
Rachel and Frank emerge from the darkness between two
garbage bins and get into the limo Henry has waiting there.
The car moves out with a SCREECH of tires, narrowly missing
Spector as he staggers out of the building.
SPECTOR
Hey! What the fuck... Farmer!
Farmer! Come back here...
The limo skids around the corner and speeds off up the
street, leaving Spector in helpless fury -- apoplectic and
speechless.
69
74
Frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate
house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man-
sion.
The grounds are quiet, beautiful, misty.
We see him from behind some foliage, as if he's being
covertly observed, stalked. A twig snaps and he turns
sharply. It's Rachel. She's dressed in a soft jumpsuit
and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him.
59.
The suit softens her appearance; she looks lovely. Her
manner, too, has altered; she is charming -- friendly and
very girlish.
RACHEL
Hey!
Gotcha, didn't I?
FRANK
Hey.
RACHEL
You're probably wondering what I'm
doing.
(as Frank nods)
You didn't know I jogged, did you?
Frank shakes his head.
RACHEL
What's the matter? 'Fraid I'll
get picked off in my snazzy running
suit?
FRANK
No. I'm afraid I'll have to jog
with you.
They both smile.
RACHEL
Great.
I guess I can't do it.
Rachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment,
rests a hand on Frank's arm to support herself. She
removes it quickly.
RACHEL
Will you walk with me a little?
Frank nods and they cut off across the grounds.
RACHEL
(hard for her)
I know this is kinda late, but
thank you. I'm really glad you're
here.
(she looks at him)
I'm going to try to cooperate.
FRANK
That would be good.
They walk in silence for few moments. When Rachel
finally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself,
nervous. It's very appealing. And if it's an act, she's
a terrific actress.
60.
RACHEL
Farmer... I have this problem.
This minor little problem. You
see, I'd like to go out for an
evening. Just me and a guy. You
know...
(makes a funny face)
... like a 'date.' But I can't go
out on a date because you have to
be with me every minute. I mean,
what if he invited me up to his
place afterwards? Are you going
to come, too?
(a beat)
So the only thing I can figure is
for you to take me out.
(pause)
So... that's what I was wondering
... you know. What do you think?
But only if you want to.
Frank is bemused.
RACHEL
Only if you want to... I'm not so
bad...
(looks at him)
God, this is embarrassing. I'm
gonna run up ahead there. You
decide.
She runs up the hill to the pool area, which is now above
them. He walks up after her.
75
75
Nicki is yelling from a window on the second floor of
the mansion. Fletcher peers out with her.
NICKI (O.S.)
Rachel!
Sandy Harris is on the
phone!
Rachel and Frank look up.
RACHEL
Tell her she'll have to wait,
babe. I'm getting fixed up here.
AT WINDOW - CLOSE ON NICKI
She watches Frank and Rachel, her expression neutral.
She turns away. Fletcher continues to watch his mother
with Frank.

Frank and Rachel exit with a small crowd.
Rachel wears a
scarf and tinted glasses. The combination
goes a long
way toward disguising her. They pause at
one of the dis-
play windows. Inside is a poster for the
movie, Yojimbo,
a large picture of Toshiro Mifune looking
scruffy and
fierce.
RACHEL
Well, he didn't look like he
wanted to die to me.
FRANK
There's a big difference between
wanting to die and having no fear
of death.
They walk down the sidewalk.
RACHEL
And because he had no fear of
death, he was invincible?
FRANK
What do you think?
RACHEL
Well, he sure creamed 'em all in
the end.
FRANK
Yeah, it was a good movie.
They walk off down the sidewalk.
RACHEL
How many times have you seen it?
FRANK
Sixty-two.
63.
86
88
Frank's car is parked in the driveway.
A light goes on
in a basement window.
89
92
The roller-blind is raised with a sharp, snapping sound.
Frank is moving around the room, getting dressed. Rachel
69.
is still in the bed behind him, woken by the noise of his
activity.
RACHEL
What? What is it? What are you
doing?
Frank keeps moving, looking for his shoes.
RACHEL
Frank?
FRANK
Rachel, I don't want to get
confused about what I'm doing
here.
RACHEL
I'm not confused.
Frank finds his shoes.
FRANK
You pay me to protect you, that's
what I do.
Rachel sits up.
RACHEL
What? Have I done something
wrong?
FRANK
No, nothing.
RACHEL
Then what is it?
She lifts the sheet seductively and looks over the top
of it.
RACHEL
Do you want me to beg?
FRANK
No, I want you to do without.
She stops.
RACHEL
What's going on, Frank?
FRANK
I want to keep it straight in my
head what job I'm doing.
70.
RACHEL
And what is that exactly?
Making
me feel like shit?
FRANK
No, I'm sorry. This is my fault.
RACHEL
Don't apologize for godsake. Just
tell me what I did. I'm a big
girl.
FRANK
You didn't do anything. It was me.
I involved myself with my client.
Rachel picks up on the word.
RACHEL
Your "client"?
FRANK
I made a mistake.
RACHEL
What mistake?... You don't find me
attractive anymore.
FRANK
Christ! I've told you why. I
can't protect you like this.
RACHEL
And what?
That's it for me?
FRANK
Yeah...
RACHEL
I don't believe it.
He automatically checks the gun as he slips it into the
holster.
FRANK
You can live with that or you can
fire me.
RACHEL
But I can't fuck you.
Frank turns and looks at her.
This is hard for him, too.
RACHEL
I don't believe this...
I'm asking you?... Let me tell
you...
71.
She stops suddenly and, with a roar of combined frus-
tration, humiliation and rage, she lurches from the bed
in search of her clothes. Frank shuts his eyes in morti-
fication and pain.
93
93
A nanny sits in the early morning mist, embroidering.
Frank is kneeling with Fletcher beside the pool. He's
putting new batteries into Fletcher's boat. Fletcher
watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the
batteries, much preoccupied.
FLETCHER
(watching him)
She's real mad at you, isn't she?
Frank stops what he's doing and just looks blankly at the
batteries in his hands. There's a beat of silence.
FLETCHER
She told me she doesn't understand
why you're so shitty to her...
Frank's shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible
sigh. He gently resumes fitting the batteries, still
not looking at Fletcher. In the quiet of early morning,
it's almost like a confessional.
FRANK
I've spent a lot of time learning
not to react to things like other
people do. It's my job. But it
doesn't always work, Fletcher...
it doesn't always work.
FLETCHER
I don't think I understand.
FRANK
(looks at him)
I'm an old man compared to you,
pal, and I don't understand either.
And I'm starting to get the
feeling I never will.
There's a crunch of footsteps behind him.
He looks
around.
With a big flourish, a copy of Daily Variety is put down
in front of us, front page upwards.
NICKI (O.S.)
Ta Da!
72.
Frank takes in that it's Nicki then glances at Variety,
lying on the concrete beside him. Splashed across the
top, the headlines announce the day's news of the
Academy Award nominations. Rachel's name is among the
Best Actress nominees. The Hollywood Reporter follows.
Frank picks up Variety and stares at it. Nicki stands
beside him with the morning's mail under her arm.
NICKI
(looking at him)
Thought you'd like to know.
Everyone said she was a sure thing.
Of course, you know all about that.
She raises an eyebrow, gives him a look. Frank looks
steadily back at her. She drops a small pile of mail
beside the magazines... several letters and a small
packet. She's embarrassed by Frank's gaze.
NICKI
I'm sorry. That was out of line.
It's none of my business... Here's
today's question marks for you.
She turns and walks briskly back to the house. Frank
watches her go, then looks slowly down to the pile.
From across the pool, Fletcher watches silently, then
pushes his boat out into the deep water.
94
- DAY
We COME STREAKING IN OVER the ocean TOWARD the towering
white Fontainebleau.
ON the SOUNDTRACK, we hear JOHN TESH'S VOICE filling the
viewers in on the latest Hollywood dirt.
JOHN TESH (V.O.)
...It's off to Sun City today for
Best Actress nominee Rachel Marron.
Rachel's giving two AIDS charity
concerts this week at Miami's
Fontainebleau Hotel. A thousand a
plate no less. And rumor has it
that the lovely lady has unseated
the governor of Florida himself.
Seems there was a showdown on
who'll get to lounge in that big
Fontainebleau penthouse tonight.
As we CIRCLE the top floor, we see a tiny figure on the
balcony.
JOHN TESH (V.O.)
Well, sleep tight in the
Presidential Suite, Rachel. Who
says a nomination isn't as good as
winning...
97
97
Frank looks up at the disappearing helicopter then down
77.
over the edge and around the corner. He leans slightly
against the wrought iron railing. It sways precariously.
Frank catches himself.
FRANK
Thuringer.
Frank kneels and inspects the fixture that anchors it to
the cement balcony: the cement crumbles around it, a
weld joint is broken on the side. THURINGER, the hotel
security chief, joins Frank on the balcony. Frank shakes
the railing.
THURINGER
God damn.
I'll get someone right
on it.
98
112
This place is crowded with hundreds
of guests basking on
chaise lounges. A sea of sun-baked
faces virtually as
far as the eye can see. The sight
of the crowd and the
presence of the news crew seems to
push Rachel to a
whole new adrenaline level.
Rachel walks among them, moving swiftly, evaluating the
bodies displayed before her in words and expressions,
playing to the camera.
RACHEL
Oh my God. Look what they're
wearing. Mother, hide your eyes...
Heads turn to look.
RACHEL
I couldn't wear that suit... Honey,
you're naked... Of course, if I
had a body like that...
There is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests.
She pauses to shake a hand, and now all the guests
throughout the pool area are aware that Rachel Marron is
among them.
People stand on chairs, scramble for pens and paper, run
80.
to get a closer look. Lounges collapse, drink GLASSES are
BROKEN, flower tubs are trampled. A lot of pushing and
shoving starts - too much for the video crew, who abandon
the filming attempt.
SPECTOR
Great, babe. They got what they
needed. Let's get back inside.
Frank increases his pace to keep by Rachel's side, gently
easing a path for her. Schiller scurries behind in
Frank's wake.
Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard
appears in the throng. She eyes him appreciatively.
RACHEL
(to lifeguard)
You look like a man of good taste
to me. Come to my party tonight.
(to Schiller)
Ben, make sure this boy gets to
my party.
Schiller nods. Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he
gets the point, and then she's off again. The throng
gets tighter. Frank's having to work harder, steering
her towards the door back into the hotel. The familiar
chant starts up: "Rachel, Rachel." It's starting to
resemble the frenzy of the opening scene. This time,
amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few
bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved
forward. A child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs
and Bermuda shorts. A distraught mother tries to reach
him. Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd
surges again.
Amid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause.
Rachel
drinks it all in.
RACHEL
(over her shoulder)
Thank you. Thank you. Come
tonight and give till it hurts.
With a final surge, Frank makes it to the door with his
party. The door closes shut behind them. A mass of
distorted faces pushes onto the glass. The party walks
on briskly.
RACHEL
(to Spector)
I'm beginning to wonder about your
judgement, Sy. Why do I have to
keep paying my dues if I've
already arrived?
81.
SPECTOR
(very fast)
Kick me, beat me... whatever makes
you feel good. But let's not
pretend you don't like it. We're
too close for that. Whipping
people into a frenzy is why you
got into it in the first place.
Rachel's eyes lock with
Spector's -- there's a real connec-
tion and understanding
here that she spends a lot of time
denying. Frank sees it
as clearly as Spector, whose tone
becomes almost soothing
--
SPECTOR
And it's nothing to be ashamed of,
either, not for a second. It's a
gift... and only a handful are
given it. Many call but few are
answered.
SPECTOR (CONT'D)
Don't fool with the blessing,
Rachel. The magic is sustained
through its use.
RACHEL
Now you're going to tell me about
magic? Give it a rest will ya...
SPECTOR
I'm done. Not another word...
(a crooked smile)
... I know you like to be reminded
sometimes.
Rachel looks away.
It's true.
He's good at his job.
113
113A
Fireworks explode over the water.
82.
114
116
Thuringer has set up a checkpoint through which all
guests are passing.
As they get off the elevator, they walk up to a desk
manned by one of Thuringer's uniformed guards. When
their names have been checked off a master list, they
walk past another guard wielding a metal detector. No
one likes it, but they all do it.
Most of the local TV stations have sent camera crews.
The
handheld cameras move among the guests, their bright
lights flaring. FLASHBULBS POP. It's a local media
event.
Frank squints as a quartz light shines straight in his
face.
A tall, fit, athletic-looking man raises his arms; is
cleared by the metal detector. He is GREG PORTMAN.
117
118
Rachel's taking a breather on the balcony, drinking cham-
pagne, talking to Portman and another couple. Everybody's
high and happy. Conversation bubbles.
FRANK'S POV
Rachel leans into Portman; heads together, they whisper
intimately. Rachel laughs, then for a brief moment, turns
her head to look directly at Frank. Her look is petulant,
defiant. Portman does not see this.
119
121
Rachel and Portman are poised precariously halfway over
the railing. Frank's hand shoots out, grabs Rachel's
wrist and tugs at the pair of them.
Portman regains his balance first and pulls Rachel back
from the edge.
FRANK
What happened!
PORTMAN
Somebody tripped. It's okay.
RACHEL
(looking at Portman)
Thank God I had a bodyguard here.
She grasps the railing and looks over.
RACHEL'S POV
Staring down twenty stories of distance between her and the
pool area.
Way, way below her, her champagne GLASS hits the tile
with a MUFFLED SHATTERING sound.
RACHEL
It's a long way down, Frank.
(to Portman)
You saved my life.
Frank eyes the newly-welded anchor fixture.
It has
held.
Rachel takes Portman by the arm.
The front of her dress
is stained with champagne.
RACHEL
Maybe someone will keep an eye
on me while I change.
She leads Portman past Frank and up the stairs toward
her bedroom. Frank and Portman lock eyes. Portman
shrugs; he feels badly for Frank.
122
125
Frank steps outside. No one there. The moonlight re-
flects off the ocean. The SURF sounds a STEADY BEAT.
It is peaceful and quiet. A relief.
On the Katz's balcony, forty feet away, little Mark Katz
is leaning against the railing, staring at Rachel's
suite. Frank smiles at him.
FRANK
(softly)
Go to sleep.
Frank looks out at the ocean. After a pause, in the
background, Mark slips inside the Katz suite.
126
127
Frank looks out at the ocean.
ECHOING on the soundtrack, we hear the song 'WHAT BECOMES
OF THE BROKEN HEARTED' that Rachel and Frank danced to.
It sounds slow and sweet and a long way away.
Frank stares out at the ocean. Totally divorced from
everything in the suite behind him, in the world around
him. There is only the moon and the ocean. For this
89.
one moment, his guard is down.
127A
147
Frank looks out at the ocean. The breeze washes over his
face. A huge brightly-lit yacht is sailing by, close to
shore. Frank looks at it reflectively.
96.
He senses another presence and looks to his right.
Rachel sits huddled in a balcony chair. The bright
moon-
light illuminates her as she looks out to sea. She
is
wearing one of her spectacular show gowns, her hair has
been brushed, and her stage makeup has been applied.
But
tonight it hasn't come together. It doesn't work.
She
holds a cigarette and the breeze keeps it glowing.
This
is the only time we've seen her smoke.
RACHEL
Farmer... Nothing that's happened
between us matters... I understand
now... You're going to have to
believe me, because I'm not going
to beg.
She takes a long drag on her cigarette.
RACHEL
It wasn't what he said... it was
the way he said it... he was so...
Her voice cracks.
She stops and tries to compose herself.
RACHEL
I need you... I'm afraid... and I
hate it. I hate my fear...
(a beat)
Please protect me... Protect
Fletcher... If anything happened
to him...
Frank looks at her. Tears are destroying her elaborate
stage makeup. She wipes them away with her hand.
FRANK
I can't protect you like this.
It's impossible. The odds are on
his side.
RACHEL
I'll do whatever you say.
This is the first time Frank has ever heard Rachel say
that. He studies her, then looks out at the ocean.
FRANK
I want to take you away for
a while.
Rachel nods.
FRANK
Somewhere people don't know about.
She nods again, agreeing.
97.
FRANK
No Spector or Devaney or Tony.
He looks at her, reading her face for any hesitation.
There is none.
FRANK
If you cross me up this time, I'll
kill you myself.
Rachel smiles, weakly but with obvious relief.
148
148
DAY
A large, old, two-story house sits at the top of a slight
rise, surrounded on three sides by thick, rolling woods.
Sloping gently down from the house to the lake fifty yards
away is a broad expanse of lawn.
Snow lies on the ground
and in the trees. At the edge of
the lake, a dock and
boathouse. An entrance road cuts
out of the trees.
A little TERRIER skitters to the edge of the drive
BARKING.
A van emerges from the trees, tires CRUNCHING through the
snow.
Frank's father, HERB, steps onto the front porch. He's
in his mid-60's, lean, tan and fit. He's wearing a plaid
shirt, jeans and cowboy boots.
The van stops in front of the house. Frank steps out
from the driver's seat and eyes his dad.
FRANK
Lake's a little low.
HERB
Fill up soon enough when she thaws.
(glancing at the van)
They all in trouble?
FRANK
Just one.
149
151
Fletcher, Rachel and Frank are chugging across the golden
water in the skiff. Fletcher sits at the back, operating
the outboard, controlling the movements of the boat. He
wears a life vest. Rachel watches him proudly. Fletcher
locks the throttle into place and takes his hands off it
for a laughing moment with a "Look, Mom, no hands"
gesture.
Rachel looks to Frank and smiles, the wind blowing her
hair.
WIDE ON LAKE - DUSK
CAMERA is DOWN at water level by the lake's edge. In the
distance, the small boat skims across the surface. A
light mist is coming up.
152
152
Henry helps Fletcher tie up the boat for the night.
It
is much foggier now and almost dark.
FRANK
I don't want anyone going out in
it until you've checked it over
first. Okay? Every time.
Henry nods.
100.
HENRY
Every time.
FRANK
Every time.
In the distance, Rachel and Fletcher have just reached
the house where Nicki scoops up Fletcher and spins him
round and round in a circle. She hugs him close and
kisses his hair.
After a few moments, Fletcher squirms
free and runs to catch up with Rachel.
153
159
Details are barely distinguishable in the fog. We hear
the gentle LAPPING of the LAKEWATER against the dock.
160
162
Bright sun. Frank and his father walk along the lake
shoreline, stooping here and there to finger animal
prints in the snow and mud.
FRANK
Raccoon... deer...?
Herb nods.
Their attention is drawn to soft singing up by the house.
162A
162A
Nicki absently sings an old gospel tune as she tosses
breakfast scraps to a group of hungry ducks gathered by
the porch.
162B
162B
HERB
I've never heard church music in
the middle of the week before.
162C
162C
Nicki's soft voice is joined by Rachel's strong harmony,
and the two men watch as Rachel comes out to join her
sister on the porch, startling Nicki. Both sing for a
moment, together. Then Nicki stops, embarrassed. Rachel
gives her a hug.
107.
162D
162D
Herb and Frank are about to return to the house. They
stop short. There, at their feet, is a line of human
foot prints, from heavy snow boots, leading away into
the trees. Frank looks at Herb, suddenly alert.
FRANK
Where's Fletcher?
Henry appears at the porch of the house, carrying a
fishing rod as he comes out. At that instant, the sound
of the OUTBOARD MOTOR CRACKLES through the air. Frank's
head snaps toward the boathouse. Henry, in the distance,
looks quickly at the boathouse, then to Frank.
HENRY
(shouting)
Frank! I haven't...
But Frank is already moving, leaping from the porch
and starting to run flat out toward the boathouse
and dock.
Rachel turns to look.
The skiff appears out of the boathouse, Fletcher at the
motor, the boat's lone occupant. The boat moves slowly
away from the boathouse, parallel to the dock.
Frank is running toward the water with everything he's
got, his face contorted. The sound of the OUTBOARD
drowns out his voice as he yells.
FRANK
Fletcher!
Fletcher!
IN BOAT
Fletcher, intent on his piloting, neither hears nor sees
Frank running down the lawn behind him. The boat is
approaching the end of the dock.
DOCK
Frank finally makes it to the dock and continues to
sprint after the boat. His weight rattles the boards
as he runs.
IN BOAT
Fletcher passes the end of the dock and gives the
throttle a little twist.
DOCK
108.
Frank reaches the end of the dock at a full run and dives
directly at the rear of the moving boat. Frank's body
flies out over the boat. He knocks Fletcher out of his
seat and into the water on the other side of the skiff.
RACHEL
(screams)
No!
He can't swim!
IN WATER
Frank holds the terrified, shaking Fletcher in his arms.
Fletcher begins to cry. Frank paddles with him toward
the dock. The empty boat swerves, then continues out
toward the center of the lake.
DOCK
Henry and Rachel are already
at the end of the dock. Nicki
and Herb are running toward
it. Rachel is livid, hysterical.
Henry peers out at the boat,
which continues to bounce
innocently across the water,
defining a broad curve.
RACHEL
Fletcher, baby. Are you all
right? Baby.
Fletcher, spluttering, is handed up to Rachel by Frank.
Rachel hugs Fletcher to her. Herb bends down to check
he's breathing properly, wrapping the boy in his jacket.
HERB
He's all right.
Henry helps Frank up out of the water.
Frank sits on
the end of the dock, breathing hard.
RACHEL
What are you doing? You out of
your mind? You're crazy!
(to Fletcher)
You're all right, baby.
(back to Frank)
You could have drowned him!
Frank and Henry look out toward the boat which has come
to a stop out in the middle of the lake.
FRANK
I'm sorry.
I got careless.
Henry looks at Frank.
He feels terrible about not
checking the boat.
HENRY
Frank, I'm sorry. I should have...
109.
HERB
It's okay, Henry.
Herb puts his hand on Fletcher's head.
HERB
You all right now, son?
Fletcher nods, his crying ends raggedly.
Frank begins
to stand up.
HENRY
How do we get the boat back?
Out in the center of the lake, the BOAT BLOWS UP.
Every-
one on the dock jumps.
Nicki screams.
Frank sits down again. He shakes his head. On an
impulse, he stretches out his hand, palm downward.
It's
trembling slightly.
162E
162F
Frank slides out from under the van. The hood is up.
Henry stands nearby. Frank goes to the driver's seat.
FRANK
(to Henry)
Back off.
Henry moves away from the van.
Frank inserts the key in
the ignition.
162G
162G
Herb comes out of the house, fast. His eyes scan the
woods as he heads towards the shed.
HERB
Frank!
Henry turns and motions to Herb to stay away.
162H
162-I
Henry and Herb watch.
Frank gets out of the van.
He
walks to Herb.
HERB
Someone's cut the phone lines. It
could be anywhere between here and
town.
FRANK
Both the cars are dead. And I
can't see how it was done.
Frank and Herb exchange a look.
FRANK
Who could know we're here? This
place has nothing to do with her.
HERB
Maybe it has to do with you.
Frank looks at him.
HERB
We can't walk out of here at
night with them.
Frank shakes his head.
FRANK
We'll button down tonight and
walk out at first light.
162J
162J
There is a light ground-mist. The moon shines down
down brightly but the house is totally dark.
162K
175
The fog is thick. Frank swiftly emerges from the back
door and stops, dead still, listening. There is only the
RUSTLING of TREES.
175A
175B
Frank listens. Suddenly he hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, a
body breaking through the bushes. Frank heads off
towards the sound at a run.
176
176
INTERCUT - FRANK AND FIGURE
116.
The move fitfully through the eerie, beautiful scene.
In and out of the fog. Stop, listen,
wait, go. Two
wary, interchangeable animals. Frank
disappears into
the fog. When the figure reappears,
Frank is moving
faster, closing the gap.
The figure, seen in CLOSEUP for the first time, is wear-
ing a dark-colored ski mask.
His breath billows out of
the mouth hole, whitening in the cool March air. He
hears Frank APPROACHING and points his gun in the
direction of the FOOTSTEPS.
He does not fire. SILENCE.
Frank stops and rests on his haunches. Listening, he
hears the intruder move. The sounds have stopped up
ahead. Close.
The figure peers into the fog, gun up.
He's ready,
confident. He waits. Nothing.
Frank, from his crouch, does something brand-new. He
raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip, ready
to fire. He holds it easily. And then he does something
really strange: Frank closes his eyes. After a beat, we
hear MOVEMENT. Frank, eyes still closed, swings his gun
15 degrees and FIRES TWO BLASTS.
The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered
six inches from his shoulder. His eyes are wild behind
his ski mask. Frightened, he suddenly crashes away in
the opposite direction. We FOLLOW. There is ANOTHER
SHOT from Frank very close to the man.
176A
176B
Frank moves quickly through the woods, passes the
splintered tree. We STAY WITH him and hear the ENGINE
of a CAR ROAR to life and TIRES PEEL OUT of the dirt.
Frank breaks out of the woods in time to see the red
lights at the back of the car as it fishtails around a
bend. He EMPTIES his GUN at it. We hear GLASS
SHATTERING, but the car keeps going.
176C
181
Rachel's black limousine moves slowly up the winding
drive, followed by a black Mercedes limousine. Behind
the cars, the gates close on a large press contingent
gathered outside, held back by a large number of police
and security guards. A light drizzle is falling.
The two cars pull up to the entrance, Henry at the wheel
of Rachel's. Frank gets out of the front and opens the
back door. Devaney and Spector help Rachel and Fletcher
out of the car. They are all dressed in black. A few
other mourners, including Emma, get out of the Mercedes.
Rachel, red-eyed and weary, takes Fletcher under her arm
and goes inside. She does not look at Frank.
182
186A
It's bright sunshine. Fletcher is splashing noisily in
the pool with a few other kids. His nanny waits
patiently at the side, towels at the ready.
At one side of the pool, Rachel sits, lost in thought,
mourning her sister.
At the other side sits Frank, also thoughtful. He, too,
is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears
some of the responsibility.
The SHOUTS and LAUGHTER of the kids continue.
187
187
The guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi-
nated in the distance. The guard patrols at his station.
Inside, the T.V. screens flicker and glow.
Perched on the top of a slight
hill, Frank sits alone and
motionless under a big tree.
He gazes down at the gate-
house, his face lit softly by
the glow from its lamps.
All around him the rest of the
estate is quiet and
tranquil in the moonlight.
After a moment, another silhouetted figure slowly ap-
proaches and stands beside him. It's Rachel.
RACHEL
I guess you've heard what's
happening.
Frank nods.
RACHEL
Mind if I sit down?
Frank shakes his head. They sit side by side for awhile,
both lost in thought. Rachel seems very calm.
RACHEL
It isn't over yet, is it?
Frank shakes his head.
FRANK
He knows he still hasn't got you.
RACHEL
So he'll come again?
122.
FRANK
It's possible.
RACHEL
The Oscars?
FRANK
Maybe.
Rachel takes this philosophically.
She tugs at the
grass, thinking.
RACHEL
When I was back in Squirrel Hill,
I started betting my friends
fifty bucks each that someday I'd
win an Oscar. You can understand
how important it is that they see
me up there if I win.
She looks at him and smiles.
RACHEL
If everyone of those pikers comes
through, it could add up to a lot
of money.
FRANK
I think it's very dangerous.
RACHEL
I know. But I can't stay up here
on my hill forever.
They are silent for awhile.
Rachel lies back on the
grass, stares at the sky.
RACHEL
I didn't get to this place in my
life by doing the smart thing
every time.
(as Frank nods)
How 'bout you, Frank Farmer? Out
there on the edge... did you ever
do something that didn't make too
much sense, except maybe inside
you? In your stomach somewhere?
Something that wasn't smart?
(looks at him)
I'll bet you have plenty. I'll
bet you do. Nobody gets really
good without it. And you're good.
I know that.
She sits up beside him.
123.
RACHEL
I don't know why all this has
happened to me...
(a beat)
... but I do know that none of
it's your fault. I hope you can
hear me, because this is how I say
I'm sorry.
Frank accepts.
RACHEL
(relieved)
So... I'm going to go see if I win
an Oscar. And I won't worry about
it at all. Because I've got you
to protect me.
Frank almost smiles.
FRANK
That's right.
He looks at her a long time, then takes her in his arms.
He kisses her and lays her down. His body moves over
hers. Like a bodyguard, protecting her from the night.

188
The chaos and razamatazz of Oscar night.
Crowds, limos,
cameras, searchlights...

More quartz lights click on.
The TV cameras all focus on the door of the limo as Frank
steps out of the way.
FRANK'S POV
as he surveys the busy scene. A microphoned M.C. peers
into Rachel's limo and walks toward it.
M.C.
... Miss Rachel Marron!
ON TV CAMERA MONITOR we see Rachel wave to the crowd.
M.C.
Everyone wishes you the best
tonight, Rachel.
Frank leads the small procession down the red carpet.
Fans reach out asking for his autograph.
FRANK'S POV
125.
as his glance darts around: high into the bleachers,
ahead in the distance, to the door, to the side at
photographers nodding to the massed security men with
their walkie-talkies.
Rachel's smile is convincing, lovely, professional.
Spector, Devaney and Tony look strained.
As they enter, a WIDE SHOT from across the street shows
their limo pulling ahead as the next car pulls up. The
CAMERA TRACKS SIDEWAYS to reveal the rear fender of a
Toyota 4X4 parked in the foreground.

A chaos of press and public, ambulance and police lights
flashing, SIRENS WAILING.
ANGLE ON PART OF CROWD
Police and paramedics surrounding a man on a stretcher --
it is Frank -- Rachel walks at his side, clutching his
hand as he is rushed to an ambulance. Tony, a dressing
over his eyes, is also helped out by paramedics. Among
the gathered crowd, we focus in on one face. It is Dan,
pushed back to the sidelines and unable to see what is
happening. He slowly turns and walks away. CAMERA
CRANES to a HIGH WIDE SHOT of the scene.

A buffed-out charter turboprop stands on the tarmac as
the last pieces of equipment of Rachel's band are loaded
aboard from a truck. A limousine pulls up and Rachel
gets out with Tony and Court, who is clearly acting as
her bodyguard.
She greets some members of the band and others who will
be part of her entourage. A roadie has her luggage
removed from the limo and loaded aboard the plane.
Devaney is trying to hurry her on board. Spector is
conspicuous by his absence.
As Rachel and the others prepare to get onto the plane,
Tony, wearing a dark leather eyepatch, reacts to
something O.S.
Frank approaches from the nearby parking area. He is
pale. Under his clothes it can be seen that his torso is
still taped. He smiles as Tony. Their handshake becomes
a quick abrazo.
FRANK
(indicating eyepatch)
How's it going?
147.
TONY
Under control. But it won't be
the same... ya mutt.
Tony fakes a glancing blow to Frank's chin. Over by the
plane, Fletcher spots Frank and tugs at Rachel's dress,
till she turns to look. Fletcher runs up to Frank and
hugs him around the knees. Rachel approaches and Tony
moves back toward the plane.
Devaney waves in Frank's direction, tapping his watch to
indicate they are late. Frank waves and smiles.
Rachel's surprised to see Frank, but clearly happy.
Fletcher is ecstatic.
RACHEL
You shouldn't be here.
Frank laughs.
There is a pause.
RACHEL
So, you're quitting show business?
FRANK
Yeah.
RACHEL
Too bad. You had talent.
What
are you going to do?
FRANK
I thought I might hole up with my
dad.
(pats bandaged torso)
Finish that chess game.
Rachel nods approvingly.
RACHEL
Get him when Fletcher's not
around.
FRANK
(ruffling Fletcher's
hair)
That's the idea.
Fletcher grins.
Rachel starts to cry.
FRANK
So, how's the new guy?
RACHEL
He's got white hair, Frank.
148.
FRANK
He's very good.
RACHEL
Why'd you have to get me an old
man?
FRANK
I don't trust you.
RACHEL
Yeah... well, give me a kiss and
let's get this over with.
Frank gives her an awkward hug.
They kiss.
FRANK
'Bye Rachel.
Rachel turns quickly. She almost runs up the boarding
ladder. Frank remains watching her. Fletcher looks back
over his shoulder as they disappear into the plane.
222
224
The nosewheel starts to taxi.
The plane moves forward.
225
226
149.
The steps start to fold down out of the plane, but not
fast enough for Rachel.
She jumps the last six feet, staggering slightly as the
plane's jet wash hits her, whipping her clothes and hair.
Without pausing, she runs to Frank who takes her in his
arms. They embrace and kiss. They kiss again and again.
Finally, slowly, Rachel draws back, her eyes are filled
with tears.
RACHEL
Remember when you said you'd risk
your life for me?
Frank tries to break in, but she won't let him interrupt.
RACHEL
I didn't really believe it then.
Nobody means what they say. But
you did, Frank. You did it. You
laid it all on the line for me.
Frank tries to speak, she puts her hands to his lips.
RACHEL
Don't wreck this for me. I don't
want to hear any bullshit about
you just doing your job. You did
more than save my life, Frank.
You showed me a way to be. And I
love you for it.
(a beat)
There, I said it.
(looks at him)
I'll never forget what it felt
like to be under your eye. Never.
FRANK
(smiles)
I won't be forgetting you either.
She presses something into Frank's hand.
RACHEL
Here... I want you to keep this.
If you ever need me, you just put
this on and no matter where you
are I will find you.
I promise.
She gives him a quick kiss and walks back toward the
plane, her eyes holding Frank's. Frank opens his palm
to reveal the little enamel cross.
ON FRANK
as the engines roar and the plane turns to taxi out.
150.
The ROAR of the plane becomes APPLAUSE.
227
227
Rachel's face in FULL FRAME, bathed in light and the
applause of a huge audience.
RACHEL
Thank you... Thank you... Now I
want to sing you an old song, but
it's a new favorite.
As the music begins, Rachel stands alone in front of the
band, mike in hand.
RACHEL
You know, this song used to make
me feel sad... But it doesn't
anymore.
Rachel pauses.
The audience is still.
RACHEL
Now it just reminds me of someone
very special... This is for him.
Rachel begins to sing the song 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE
BROKEN HEARTED' - slow and sweet.
It's the song she and Frank danced to.
As a VERSE
TRAILS OFF --
