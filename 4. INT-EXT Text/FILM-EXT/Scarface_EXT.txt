Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot-
As he
finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling.
Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony.
Someone
picks
up
the
phone. An older woman's Voice.
His
expression
alters
to
uncertainty.
VOICE
Yes? ..Hello?..Who
is this?
Tony changes his mind, hangs up.
Pause. The faces of those
in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive.
Then recognizes
somebody
in
another
phone
booth
and
goes
over.
Angel Frenandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
worn phone book in his hand.

A small woman -- the Lizard -- steps out in shadow in the
parking lot of the Sun-Ray across the street, looks around,
sees nothing, casually goes back in.

Manny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram

notice.
At the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens....

and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and
shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She
crashes backwards into the room, wounded.
Everything
happens very fast now.
Manny is
at
the lip
of
the bathroom,
he
fires
and
hits
kid
one, who
is
turning,
in
the neck.
Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the
unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling
across
the bathroom.
The
Toad, chainsaw
in
hand,
slashes
at
Manny.
Manny
fires
a
burst
into
him
and
the
Toad
crashes
backwards.
Manny
now
spins
into
a
wall,
hit
in
the
side.
The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
him.
In b-g., the window simultaneously blows out as
Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.
In sharp f-g., the
Lizard
crumples
forward
on
her
knees,
foaming blood.
Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes
kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the
stock of his own Ingram.
In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with
strength, he tears out the motel room door
hysterical
gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.

Chi-Chi
climbing
through
the
window
fires
at
him.
Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces
a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-
second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine
pistol.
He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten
craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.
Tony,
yelling, whirls
after
the
Toad.
TONY
I
got him!
Manny, holding his side, empties
his
pistol
on
kid
one
who
is still twitching.
Chi-Chi

The senior citizens, playing Mah-Jorigg on the porch, mutter
in astonishment.
As the Toad staggers out into the parking lot,
blood
flying,
chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.
Their
eyes
follow.
As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set
in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.
There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all
that counts.
He stands behind the Toad.
TONY
(Spanish)
Your'turn,
cabron!...
The
Toad
whips
around
to
the
voice, eyes
stark
with
terror.
Tony
empties
the
clip
into
the
Toad,
blowing
hiin
apart.
The bystanders just
stare, stunned
by
the
ferocity.
Then
an old lady faints.
The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony
turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his
audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance
and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identi-
fication.
