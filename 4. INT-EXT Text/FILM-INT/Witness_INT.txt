The coffin has the upper half open. We see that the corpse
has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen
partially covering the bearded face.
END TITLE SEQUENCE
Partitions have been removed, making the central rooms of
the farmhouse a spacious hall. The place is packed, a hundred-
fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows
of wooden benches. A wooden coffin rests on a bench in the
f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy
a special Place.
RACHEL LAPP
A young woman of perhaps twenty-seven. Her face is pale and
drawn.
In happier circumstances, although there haven't been too
many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual
woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence.
Eight-year-old SAMUEL LAPP flits next to his mother; he would
appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events.
And the patriarch, ELI LAPP; his stubborn, weathered  yet
not unkind  features grief-stricken.
THE MOURNERS
Their faces...
CLOCK
As it begins to CHIME nine a.m.
FAVORING PREACHER
As he removes his hat. As one, the men in the congregation
remove their hats also.
Then the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect:
SUBTITLES OVER.
PREACHER
...a brother has been called home.
God has spoken through the death of
our neighbor, Jacob Lapp...
THE FAMILY
Where Rachel, Samuel and Eli are SITTING - SOUNDS of emotion
and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as:
PREACHER
...husband of Rachel, father to
Samuel, son of Eli.
(and)
His chair is empty, his bed is empty,
his voice will be heard no more. He
was needed in our presence, but God
needs such men, too. That one should
be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow.
Still, we would not wish him back.
Rather we should prepare ourselves
to follow him.
TIGHTENING to the Lapps, and...
Where the Amish have gathered for the traditional post
funeral, midday meals.
Long tables are laden with customary Amishfare... crocks of
soup, hams, fowl, fried boiled eggs and pickled beets,
preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries.
RACHEL
Where she sits among women, accepting their condolences.
DANIEL HOCHSTETLER
A brawny-armed, ruggedly-handsome, raffish looking Amishman.
There is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic
set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. Not exactly
what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up
man nonetheless, and at ease among men. He's among a group
of men including old STOLTZFUS, the local healer, FISHER,
BIEILER and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom.
STOLTZFUS
Lapp was a good farmer. None better.
BEILER
But not the man to buy a horse for
you.
(and)
Hochstetler, wasn't it your father
sold him that horse with a ruptured
testicle?
TOM
(grins)
Told him it was a bee sting made him
limp that way.
HOCHSTETLER
(amused)
That horse had one good ball. That's
all it takes.
The others chuckle. But Hochstetler's attention is still on
Rachel.
RACHEL
As Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a
tree in front of her.
At ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this.
All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability,
tune in as Rachel looks up.
HOCHSTETLER
I was sorry to hear about Jacob. Let
us hope he walks close with God.
RACHEL
I'm sure he does, Daniel.
FIELDS, LAPP FARM  DAY
It is some time after the funeral and the Lapp family is
hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing. The
death of Jacob has increased the work load on all three 
Samuel maneuvers a four-mule team while Rachel and old Eli
work nearby, further breaking up the earth. Rachel looks up
from the back-breaking labor as several figures approach 
it's Daniel Hochstetler and two of his brothers. Without a
word they fall in beside Eli and Rachel and take up various
tasks associated with the work in hand.
Daniel works close beside Rachel.
As Samuel spots something out of the window that causes him
to light up.
SAMUEL
Look, Mama...!
HIS POV THROUGH WINDOW
A road runs parallel to the train track, and Hochstetler in
his wagon urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts
to keep pace with the train.
BACK TO SCENE
As Rachel smiles.
RACHEL
I see, darling.
And Samuel cranes to look back, waving, for as long as he
can.
Now Samuel is staring out the window with some confusion,
almost apprehension:
SAMUEL
Is this where we're going?
RACHEL
Of course not. We're going to
Baltimore. It's much nicer in
Baltimore.
And Rachel draws her son closer, turning her back on the
window.
Rachel is in a line at one of the counters. The plain dress
of the two Amish  particularly Samuel's black coat and hat
 are drawing curious stares.
SAMUEL
He's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a
little girl about his own age, standing in line with her
parents at the next counter. He edges away from his mother...
ANGLE
As Samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock
coat and flat-brimmed hat... the man's back is turned, could,
from appearances, be an Amishman.
Samuel stares... A beat, the man turns to face Samuel and we
discover that he is a Hasidic Jew.
SAMUEL
As he reacts.
BACK TO TICKET COUNTER
As Rachel's turn arrives. The TICKET SELLER glances up and
she shows him her ticket.
RACHEL
We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where
is that train, please?
TICKET SELLER
Delayed three hours. You'll hear an
announcement when it's time to board.
He starts to go without his hat, but Rachel collars him and
puts it on his head.
ANGLE IN MEN'S ROOM
As Samuel enters.
It's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls... Samuel stops
before one of the urinals  a long, trough-like affair with
water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel.
It's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making GLUGGING
FLUSHING NOISES that are, at least, intimidating. Samuel
stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls,
stoops to see which are empty.
HIS POV  TOILETS
Beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible. Samuel
is alone in the restroom.
BACK TO SCENE
As Samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a
stall near the end. He enters. As he does so, a heavily
bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency,
he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind
a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up.
Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large
BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat.
His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and
a short leather jacket.
They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace.
The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for
him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close
confines of the lavatory.
ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL
As the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall... he
can see their feet under the edge of the door.
BACK TO FIGHT
As the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young
man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color.
The two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's
hand bloodstained. His partner stares at what they've
accomplished with a stunned expression:
PARTNER
Jesus...
The young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with
blood.
He stares at it, staggers toward the sinks. Finally his
bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror.
Then he collapses to the floor.
The black man motions for his partner to watch the door,
then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind
the dispenser.
ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL
As he edges open the stall door a crack. Over his shoulder
we can see the black man, his BACK TO US, rifling the
backpack. But beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we
catch sight of the black man's face.
SAMUEL
As he stares out the narrow crack. A beat, then he closes
the stall door.
ANGLE IN STALL
Samuel tries to make the latch work, but it's warped and
won't fall closed.
BLACK MAN
As he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket.
His partner is covering the door, an automatic in his hand.
The black man makes for the exit, then on second thought,
glances at the row of stalls.
HIS POV  STALLS
All quiet, but...
BACK TO SCENE
The black man whips out a .38 caliber revolver, and, starting
at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors.
ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL
As the black man approaches, Samuel working desperately on
the latch. At the last minute he finally wedges it in.
BLACK MAN
He elbows Samuel's stall... the door won't open.
ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL
Fighting back panic, Samuel has retreated as far as he can.
BLACK MAN
As he gives the door a kick. It holds. He swears under his
breath.
ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL
In desperation, Samuel does the only thing he can think of...
he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the
black man just checked out. But he loses his hat in the
process. His hand snakes back INTO FRAME to snatch it just
as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that
splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges. He's
framed there, the big muzzle of the .38 revolver looking
down our throats.
ANGLE
As his partner snaps from the doorway:
PARTNER
Will you come on, for Christ's sakes!
A beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to
follow the partner out.
BACK TO SAMUEL
As we hear the SOUND OF THE TWO MEN EXITING the lavatory. A
long beat, then Samuel opens the stall door a crack.
HIS POW THROUGH DOOR
Samuel's own face reflected in the blood-smeared mirror...
then PANNING DOWN to the still figure of the young man lying
in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor.
BENCH WAITING ROOM  LOW ANGLE  NIGHT
Samuel sits close to his mother, his face pale, his eyes
staring.
Rachel holds his hand tightly in hers as the torsos of various
police and officials pass through foreground, occasionally
obscuring the lonely couple. There is considerable ECHOING
NOISE as commands and requests mingle with the CRACKLE OF
TWO-WAY RADIOS.
CUT TO:
DOOR  MEN'S' ROOM
The diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the
Men's room door, which is pushed open to reveal, JOHN BOOK,
who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the
crowd of police, reporters and others. He is about 40, with
a rangy, athletic body. Behind him comes CARTER, Book's black
partner  about five years younger than Book. Book is wearing
a suit, Carter is much more casually  almost disreputably 
dressed.
CUT TO:
BENCH
Little Samuel watching Book, back to crowd of police, as
Book questions an old black CUSTODIAN.
BOOK
You found the body?
CUSTODIAN
Uh uh. Not me, daddy, I just reported
it. It was the kid.
BOOK
What kid?
CUSTODIAN
How'n hell do I know what kid? The
kid in the funny black threads.
TIGHT SHOT  SAMUEL
Worry-eyed, still staring straight ahead. Then his eyes move
suddenly to his left.
BOOK'S LEGS  SAMUEL'S POV
Coming in at full stride, then stopping.
SAMUEL
He doesn't raise his eyes... just looks at the legs. And,
slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees. We see Book's
belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his
face. He stares at Samuel for a moment, then...
ANGLE  BOOK
As his face breaks into a big grin, and...
BOOK
Hi, kid.
RACHEL
Immediately alarmed, intervening.
RACHEL
What do you want of my son?
THE SCENE
As Book takes out his wallet, displays his shield.
BOOK
I'm a police officer. I'm going to
have to talk to the boy. What's his
name?
RACHEL
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.
(then, quickly)
But what happened here is none of
his affair. My sister is expecting
me... our train is leaving soon.
BOOK
There'll be another train.
(turns to Samuel)
The man who was killed tonight was a
policeman, Sam. It's my job to find
out who did it. I want you to tell
me everything you saw when you went
in there.
SAMUEL
(stammers)
I saw him.
BOOK
Who'd you see?
Sam looks at his mother.
BOOK
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the
floor?
SAMUEL
No... I saw the man who killed him.
Book stares at him in surprise, speaks over his shoulder to
Carter.
BOOK
Anybody know about this?
CARTER
I didn't even know about it.
BOOK
(back to Sam)
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he
looked like?
SAMUEL
(groping, touching
his clothes and
pointing at Carter)
He was... like him.
BOOK
(nods)
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
A beat, then Sam crosses quickly to Carter, Book's rather
slightly built partner:
SAMUEL
Not Zwartich, like him 
Book frowns, puzzled:
BOOK
Try that one again, Sam 
Samuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel
intervenes with Book. She glances at Carter:
RACHEL
May I talk to you?
ANGLE
As Rachel takes Book aside, and in a low voice:
RACHEL
Zwartich. It's the way we say...
dwarf.
(glances at Carter)
Not like him... very big.
Book nods, starts to turn back to Sam. Just then a commotion
off screen catches his attention.
BOOK'S POV  ONCOMING COPS
It's Capt. TERRY DONAHUE, Chief of Homicide, striding past
the crowd of journalists and TV crews... brushing off
reporters' questions and snapping orders to the aides he's
got in tow:
BACK TO SCENE
AS DONAHUE COMES ON BOOK:
DONAHUE
(to aides)
Close it all down... I want a man on
every exit... I want the lab in here
now!
(to Book)
And I want to talk to you, Captain.
ANGLE
As Book steps aside with Donahue... In the b.g. Rachel moves
protectively to Samuel's side.
BOOK
All right, talk.
DONAHUE
This is homicide  not Internal
Affairs! So why are you behaving
like you own this case?
BOOK
We were running Zenovitch... That's
all I can tell you. But I want it,
Terry.
(then)
I've got a call into Schaeffer.
RACHEL / SAMUEL
They can't help but watch the confrontation between Donahue
and Book... although they're keeping the volume down, it's
obviously intense and angry:
SAMUEL
(alarmed)
Momma... are they angry with us.
RACHEL
(reassuring, but hardly
in her own mind)
No... No. It is just the English
way.
Donahue has lost the confrontation; he gives Book a smile:
DONAHUE
You ought to think about coming back
to Homicide, Johnny... Stick with
Internal Affairs and you're not gonna
have any friends left.
BOOK
(smiles right back)
I'll buy a dog.
Book sits next to SCHAEFFER, a surprisingly kindly looking
man of about fifty. Schaeffer is a Deputy Chief.
SCHAEFFER
How reliable is this kid?
BOOK
Oh, he's good.
SCHAEFFER
Amish.
BOOK
Yeah.
SCHAEFFER
What have you got?
BOOK
Zenovitch was about to deliver a
list of names tonight  street
chemists... the guys processing this
P2P into speed.
SCHAEFFER
So one of them got to him.
BOOK
Maybe.
SCHAEFFER
You know who?
BOOK
Maybe.
SCHAEFFER
You're still convinced there's a
link to the department?
BOOK
If there isn't I've just wasted the
last six months.
SCHAEFFER
That's the problem. We need results.
The press is driving us crazy over
this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed
capitol of the country'. You know
the sort of thing. It's getting
political. The Commissioner's getting
very uneasy.
BOOK
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll
make it, but Set Donahue and the
Homicide Department off my back or
they'll blow the whole thing.
SCHAEFFER
When word gets out that Zenovitch
was a cop, all hell will break lose.
You've got 24 hours. That's all I
can give you. 24 hours on your own.
After that the case and the witness
go back to the Homicide Department.
SCHAEFFER
(shakes his head)
Tell you what... why don't you and
that blonde  what's-her-name  come
over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout
that.
BOOK
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
SCHAEFFER
(sighs)
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.
(dismisses him)
I'll do something for Zenovich's
wife.
Book drives around 13th Street, a ravaged corridor between
neon lit restaurants, bars, porno shops and darkened
storefronts.
Carter sits beside him, Rachel and her son in the back seat
looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters
huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about. On the
POLICE RADIO a description of the cop killing is BROADCAST
EVERY FEW MINUTES.
CARTER
I got there late, John.
BOOK
Let's just find Coalmine.
(beat)
Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You
didn't let anybody down. It happens

CARTER
(grimly)
It won't happen again.
RACHEL
Where are you taking us?
BOOK
We're looking for a suspect. We've
reason to believe he's still in the
area.
RACHEL
You have no right to keep us here.
BOOK
Yes I do. Your son is a material
witness to a homicide.
RACHEL
You don't understand, we have nothing
to do with your laws!
BOOK
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of
people like that.
RACHEL
It's not a joke.
Book decides to try contrition:
BOOK
You're right. It's not a joke. Listen,
I know a little about the Amish. I
know this has to be an ordeal for
you; and I'm really sorry you an
Samuel got involved.
Samuel shoots a look at Book then mutters something to his
mother in German. She responds in the same language. Book
frowns.
BOOK
What was that?
RACHEL
He wants to know who you are. Your
name. I told him we don't need to
know anything about you.
Book eyes Samuel:
BOOK
Book. John Book
Book lowers the window.
BOOK
Sammy, where's Coalmine?
The little man stares at the weird-looking couple in the
back seat.
SAMMY
What you got there, the Salvation
Army?
BOOK
Coalmine.
SAMMY
Try "Happy Valley".
Sixty black faces stare as the police enter. A hush falls on
the group. Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and
move up either side of him. They've moved carefully to this
point... no mistakes. From the back, the black man they've
approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did
the killing of Zenovitch. And, as Book and Carter make their
move...
Rachel and Sam recoil as the Doorman opens the door. He is
puzzled by the sight of the reluctant guests.
DOORMAN
Ma'am?
RACHEL
No! We do not stay in hotels.
Book and Carter exchange a glance.
NIGHT
An attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers
stares in disbelief as Rachel and Sam file into the house.
This is ELAINE, Book's sister. She stops Book as he tries to
follow Rachel inside.
ELAINE
How could you do this to me tonight?
I told you I had company
BOOK
Sorry. It's important.
BACK TO RACHEL
As she glances in a doorway.
HER POV  ELAINE'S KITCHEN
It's a shambles, with dirty supper dishes piled sink, the
table littered with empty beer cans.
BACK TO RACHEL
As she hustles Samuel along.
BOOK / ELAINE
Book frowns:
BOOK
Where's Timmy and Buck?
ELAINE
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
BOOK
You've got a man here and the kids
are upstairs?
ELAINE
That's none of your goddamn business!
So keep your goddamn holier-than-
thou mouth shut!
(and)
Anyway, they like Fred.
BOOK
Oh sure, Fred.
Elaine looks like she's going to blow again, then decides
it's pointless.
ELAINE
Who are these orphans, anyway?
BOOK
They're Amish.
ANGLE IN GUEST ROOM
Samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny, cluttered room.
Rachel, in a plain nightgown, is preparing to climb into the
other one.
Off screen we hear a DOOR CLOSE, presumably Book leaving. A
beat, then Elaine opens the door and looks in.
ELAINE
Everything okay?
RACHEL
Yes, thank you very much.
ELAINE
(a beat)
John said you're Amish.
RACHEL
Yes.
ELAINE
(blankly)
Oh.
She nods and goes.
Rachel crosses to Samuel, sits on the bed. Samuel looks up
at her bleakly.
SAMUEL
I don't want to stay here.
RACHEL
They are English. They don't
understand.
SAMUEL
I wish dawdie was with us.
RACHEL
(swallows)
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
She puts her hand on his forehead, closes his eyes. she
frowns, and...
Carter exits the cafe carrying burgers, donuts and a couple
of beers. Book wakes from a brief nap as Carter gets into
the car.
Book chews into his burger while Carter takes a doughnut.
Its clear they've worked through the night.
As Samuel comes out of the guest room in his night-shirt,
turns up the hall and opens the door to the bathroom.
ANGLE
But it's not the bathroom; it's Elaine's bedroom. She and
FRED are tangled in the sheets, furiously making love. Elaine
gasps, Fred manages to grunt.
FRED
Wrong door, kid.
ANOTHER ANGLE
As Samuel quickly shuts the door. A straight-faced beat;
then, barely suppressing a giggle, he hurries on...
ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM
As Rachel appears in the living room entry. Samuel is sitting
on the floor with two boys of about his own age, watching
television.
They're eating cold cereal out of a box.
RACHEL'S POV  TV SCREEN
Some artless Saturday morning cartoon.
BACK TO RACHEL
As she frowns, watching her son and the other two staring
hypnotically. And...
ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM
It's later in the morning now, as Elaine, a bit blearily,
appears in the entryway, stares in groggy disbelief.
HER POV  KIDS
Her oldest boy and Samuel are busily washing the windows
while her youngest is pushing a carpet sweeper. The TV is
off.
BACK TO ELAINE
As she stares.
ANGLE IN KITCHEN
Rachel is standing in the middle of the now immaculate kitchen
finishing a brisk mop of the floor. The coffee is perking.
Elaine appears.
ELAINE
(mutters)
Jesus...
Rachel turns cheerily.
RACHEL
Good morning.
ELAINE
(helplessly)
You didn't have to...
RACHEL
I wanted to. you were kind to take
us in last night.
(and)
Anyway, I needed something to do. I
was so angry with your brother. He's
so... agaanisish!
ELAINE
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like
John.
She takes a seat at the table, still shaking her head.
RACHEL
Just a minute. I'll pour you some
coffee.
ELAINE
You're not carrying a bullwhip...
how'd you manage to put my kids to
work?
RACHEL
(smiles)
I made it a contest... the one who
does best gets his cereal back first.
(and)
Children like to help... they only
need to be kept after a little bit.
Rachel means no harm by this, but Elaine's eyes begin to
storm.
ELAINE
Oh, is that so?
(and)
No offense, lady, but I'm not so
sure I like the idea of your coming
in here and turning the place upside
down!
Rachel's smile fades at Elaine's trembling outburst:
RACHEL
Please, I didn't mean...
Abruptly Elaine rises and snatches the mop from Rachel's
hands.
She mops furiously as she Continues:
ELAINE
I know exactly what you meant! Listen,
maybe I'm not a world-class housefrau,
but maybe I don't have time to polish
the goddamn china and keep after the
kids!
(and)
It's none of your business, but I
don't happen to have a man around
here full time. So I sell cosmetics
in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes
I can even pay the rent on time! So
maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe
I don't need to have it jammed down
my throat like this.
She finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a CLATTER:
ELAINE
There is that clean enough for you?
Rachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting
into tears. At which point Fred appears at the entry in his
undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen.
FRED
Jesus, Elaine... Somebody die and
leave you a broom?
Not a politic observation on Fred's part.
ELAINE
(blurts)
Go to hell, Fred!
And, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen. Fred stares
after her.
FRED
What's bugging her?
Unperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot,
letting his eyes take in Rachel's full figure.
As Rachel comes in with Elaine's coffee, closes the door
behind her. Elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing.
RACHEL
I brought your coffee.
She takes a seat next to the bed.
RACHEL
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that
way.
After a moment, Elaine starts to pull herself together:
ELAINE
It's okay.
(and)
Look, I shouldn't have blown my top.
It's like... somehow... I've let
everything get away from me. And you
sort of made me face it.
She takes the cup, sips the coffee. Rachel smiles at a private
thought.
ELAINE
What's so funny?
RACHEL
Fred. The way he looked when you
screamed at him.
ELAINE
(disparing)
God, Fred...
RACHEL
At home you'd never hear a woman
scream at a man that way.
ELAINE
No? Why not?
RACHEL
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish
way.
(then)
But I think it would have done me
good if I could have screamed at
your brother last night.
ELAINE
Listen, I don't know what's going on
or how you got mixed up with him,
but don't you let that self-righteous
son of a bitch push you around, okay?
Rachel smiles.
RACHEL
Okay.
Book glances irritably at Rachel:
BOOK
Now what's the problem?
RACHEL
The problem is I don't happen to
think my son should be spending all
his time with a man who carried a
gun under his coat and goes around
whacking people.
Book gives her a look:
BOOK
Whacking?
RACHEL
(firmly)
Yes. And I also want to leave this
city.
BOOK
Believe me, I'm trying to get this
over with as fast as I can. But Samuel
will probably have to come back and
testify.
RACHEL
We do not go into your courts.
BOOK
People who don't go into our courts
when they're told to sometimes go
directly into our jail.
Rachel glares at him and the ride continues on that chilly
note for a beat.
BOOK
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
RACHEL
(snaps)
No you're not 
(off his look)
You're glad, because now you've got
a witness.
(and)
I heard the other police talking
last night.
(and)
They don't seem to like you very
much.
BOOK
They kid a lot.
RACHEL
(glances at him)
I would not be too sure.
Samuel has been glancing at Book; finally he says something
to his mother in German. Book gives her an inquiring look.
RACHEL
He says you look very tired. I thought
the same thing.
Book says nothing.
RACHEL
But not a good tired.
BOOK
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
She doesn't bother to explain; Book settles even deeper into
his funk as Samuel glares at him with hostility.
Samuel sits with Book at a desk, Rachel just behind. They
are looking at a police line-up of known black drug-dealers.
Samuel shakes his head  another negative.
Book winks, slyly reaches into a pocket, produces a yellow
gumball. He surreptitiously shows it to Samuel, gives him an
inquiring look. It's a peace offering.
Samuel grins, nods imperceptibly.
ANOTHER ANGLE
As Book rolls the gumball down the table to Samuel. But just
as Samuel is about to cover it with his hand, Rachel reaches
over and plucks it off the table. She shakes her head at
Samuel.
BOOK
(to Rachel)
Just wanted to see if you were on
your toes.
Rachel sits uneasily in the outer office, one or two police
clerks eyeing her curiously. A sign on the desk reads
"Narcotics Division."
Rachel cranes forward trying to peer through a partially
open door.
A group of Narcotics Detectives are interrupted in mid
conversation by the opening of the main office door. They
stare in considerable surprise.
CUT TO:
JOHN BOOK
Standing in the doorway, holding little Samuel by the hand.
BOOK
Afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like you
to meet Samuel Lapp. We'd like a
little help.
A Narcotics Detective enters the room laden with several
volumes of mug shots. He puts them on the desk beside a
similar book which Samuel is intently studying. Sam sits on
the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker.
The Detective, SGT. KAMAN, eyes Book a little suspiciously 
internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the
working policemen in any department.
KAMAN
There's a Sgt. Carter on the phone
for you.
Book gets up and moves to the door.
KAMAN
And, Captain, don't want to rush
you, but I'm gonna need these files
back in a half hour. We got a lot of
work to do round here.
The two men leave. Samuel looks about before hopping off his
perch and following the direction taken by Book.
Through glass partitions we can see Book on the telephone in
a cubicle of an office.
Samuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the
bustle of the squadroom.
He crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques
and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of
outstanding duty and achievement.
ANGLE THOUGH GLASS CASE
As Samuel moves along, only half interested in what his eyes
are taking in, not really old enough to comprehend anyway.
Until suddenly he freezes.
SAMUEL'S POV  NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT
Enlarged, prominently displayed. The headline reads: "Division
Chief McElroy Honored For Youth Project". Accompanying the
item is a large sidebar mug-shot of McElroy  clearly the
black man who murdered the young cop in the train station
men's room.
BACK TO SAMUEL
He stares, transfixed.
A long beat, then Book, lowering himself to one knee next to
Samuel, ENTERS FRAME.
He's watching Samuel, knowing from the boy's expression that
they've found their man. Samuel slowly raises his hand to
point at the photograph. Book gently takes the boy's small
hand in his, concealing the accusation from watchful eyes.
He smiles gently at the boy.
Rachel is curled tight in her corner of the front seat holding
Samuel close. Book glances at her:
RACHEL
Why don't you arrest that man? Are
you protecting him because policeman?
BOOK
(snaps)
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the
police. I'm not in the business of
protecting crooked cops.
(eases up)
I'll make an arrest when I know
everybody involved.
Rachel shakes her head.
RACHEL
But why would they murder...
BOOK
Because  somehow  they knew I was
getting close.
(and)
Look, it's narcotics... They make
dope out of chemicals... they sell
it on the street for millions of
dollars. They'll do anything.
(and)
And they can get away with it because
they're cops.
RACHEL
(beat, then)
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I
want to go home.
BOOK
You'll be safe. You don't have to
worry.
She says nothing.
Another beat, then:
BOOK
Look, they're thinking as long as
they keep the killer out of Samuel's
way, we can't make an I.D. There's
no way they can know Samuel saw that
photograph, so he's safe.
He glances at her, but she continues ahead.
BOOK
I mean it. You will be safe.
Suddenly Rachel explodes:
RACHEL
Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn't we
feel safe in a city where the police
are so busy killing each other!
CUT TO:
The front door of Schaeffer's upper-middle class home is
opened by his wife MARILYN. She knows Book and is surprised
and delighted to see him. In the background daughter KATHY
is visible. Schaeffer himself appears and Book is welcomed
inside.
Schaeffer passes Book a drink.
Book is excited, animated... the hunter, after a long chase,
closing on his quarry:
BOOK
It was McElroy, Paul.
Schaeffer gives him a sharp look:
BOOK
Last guy I would have figured. But
he's part of it.
SCHAEFFER
I hope you don't have any doubts
about that.
BOOK
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth
shut...
(and)
It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons
of P2P confiscated four years ago...
Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.
(excited, explaining
the thing eagerly)
He salts it away somewhere... he
knows the stuff is potent, but the
street chemists haven't figured out
how to process it. But they do now.
(and)
And now the stuff is worth five-grand
a pint and there are a lot of pints
in a fifty-five gallon drum.
SCHAEFFER
(beat)
Who else knows?
BOOK
Just us.
SCHAEFFER
(shakes his head)
Okay, what are you going to need to
clean it up
BOOK
More people... Gotta pick up where
Zenovich left off. People from outside
the department.
SCHAEFFER
(nods)
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards
at Treasury. I'll take care of it.
(then)
I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut
their balls off for me. I'm counting
on you.
Schaeffer pours himself another drink.
SCHAEFFER
What's your first move?
BOOK
(expels a breath)
A hot shower... I haven't changed
clothes in two days.
Book has a gym bag open on the seat next to him, is stuffing
a tshirt under his belt to staunch the blood. And...
As he's awakened by the RINGING bedside telephone. He snaps
on a lamp... He's instantly awake, not unused to such rousing
in the wee hours. A woman sleeps beside him.
CARTER
Yeah...
INTERCUT BOOK
He's at an n.d. pay phone.
BOOK
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish
woman's name and address on my desk
calendar, I want you to lose it for
me, Now. Tonight.
CARTER
What the hell are you talking about?
What's happening.
BOOK
Nothing. I'm not going to be around
for a while. I'll call you when I
can.
CARTER
(alarmed)
Johnny, what the fuck?
BOOK
(hard)
Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of
it. Maybe at the top of it.
There's a stunned silence at the other end.
BOOK
Yeah... I can put it all together
when I get back, 'Til then, you know
nothing, understand? Business as
usual...
CARTER
(beat)
I hear you.
BOOK
(nods)
Good. Take care of that woman's name
for me. And watch your ass.
As the door opens and Elaine switches on the light, rousing
Rachel. Elaine looks haggard.
ELAINE
It's John. He says you have to leave
now. He says it's urgent.
She leaves the room as Rachel instantly awake, moves quickly
to rouse Samuel.
Book looks at himself in the mirror, his face is pale and
drawn.
He examines the wound, a cleanly drilled hole through his
right side, just under the rib cage. The wound continues to
bleed as he binds a towel tightly about him, before putting
his shirt back on.
He then carefully wipes away any traces of blood on basin
with tissues which he flushes down the toilet.
As he drives across town. Samuel is curled up asleep, his
head on Rachel's lap.
RACHEL
Where are you taking us now?
BOOK
Home.
RACHEL
You couldn't wait until morning?
Book gives her a look.
RACHEL
(insistent)
What happened?
But Book, glancing in his rearview mirror, tenses.
HIS POV  MIRROR
In it we can see a police car coming on fast, with lights
and SIREN.
BACK TO SCENE
Rachel eyes Book warily.
A beat, then the police car WAILS past. Book expels a breath.
RACHEL
You said we would be safe in
Philadelphia.
BOOK
I was wrong.
Rachel looks away, speaks almost sarcastically, MUTTERING.
RACHEL
Kinner un Narre...
["Kinner un Narre saage die Waahret"
 "Children and fools say the truth"
 Amish expressions]
NIGHT
ANGLE PAST Book's desk calendar. Carter enters in the b.g.,
crosses quickly to the desk. He snaps on a light, thumbs a
page of the calendar. Frowns.
INSERT
Rachel's name and address scribbled on a page of the calendar.
BACK TO SCENE
ANGLE
A couple of plainclothesmen have paused outside the door to
give him a look. Meets their eyes. They move on.
Carter shakes it off, goes. And...
CUT TO:
As light colors the eastern horizon, Book is crossing into
Lancaster County.
Book glances at Rachel; she's asleep. He coughs wrackingly,
hurting... cinches the belt of his overcoat even tighter.
And...
Where Eli is looking out a window.
HIS POV  BUGGY
An Amish buggy coming up the drive, past Book' s car.
ANGLE IN BEDROOM
Where Book lies on a bed. Rachel is bathing his wound with
warm water from a pan.
Eli appears in the doorway.
ELI
Stoltzfus is coming.
Rachel looks at him, nods.
Eli frowns at Book's holstered pistol lying atop his neatly
folded clothes on a chair near the bed.
ELI
That has no place in this house.
RACHEL
I know.
She picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places
them in a chest.
RACHEL
It will go when he goes.
As Samuel comes in with old Stoltzfus and Stoltzfus's teenage
son, LEVI.
RACHEL
Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus.
Stoltzfus's eyes have gone to the bed:
STOLTZFUS
That's the English is it?
As Stoltzfus runs his fingers lightly over the vicinity of
Book's wound:
STOLTZFUS (O.S.)
I feel... burning.
WIDER
As Stoltzfus, in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily,
moistens his fingertips with saliva, continues the
examination.
Finally he steps back.
STOLTZFUS
This man should be treated in town.
(indicates)
The bullet entered there... and came
out there. But there is the danger
of infection, and he has lost a great
deal of blood.
Rachel looks at Stoltzfus, then turns away, torn by her
dilemma.
Her eyes fall on Samuel. Gently she ushers him from the room:
RACHEL
Go help Levi with the car, Samuel.
She closes the door after him, then turns to face Eli and
Stoltzfus:
RACHEL
No, he must stay here.
Stoltzfus gives Eli a puzzled look. And:
ELI
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if
he dies? Then the sheriff will come.
They'll say we broke their laws 
RACHEL
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But
if he does, then we'll find a way so
no one knows!
ELI
Rachel, this is a man's life, we
hold it in our hands.
RACHEL
I know God help me, I know that,
Eli.
(then)
But I tell you that if he's found
here, the people who did this to him
will come for Samuel.
Rachel beseeches them helplessly:
RACHEL
What else can we do?
As Stoltzfus and Levi are about to go: Stoltzfus turns to
Rachel:
STOLTZFUS
Make a poultice... three parts milk,
two parts linseed oil... for the
infection.
I'll send Mary by with some teas I will brew myself.
RACHEL
Thank you.
Stoltzfus turns to Eli:
STOLTZFUS
Lapp, I'll have to speak with the
diener on this matter.
ELI
(nods)
As you see fit, Stoltzfus.
CUT TO:
As Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning
low at bedside. She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered.
Book's brow is beaded with sweat.
Rachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat-
soaked sheet. Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should
get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on
display here just now than she's quite comfortable with.
She begins to apply the poultice.
ANGLE
As Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he
recoils with alarm.
RACHEL
It's all right! You have got to lie
still.
Book stares up at her without recognition, but some of what
she says seems to penetrate. He quiets.
RACHEL
(soothingly)
Yes, much better...
ANGLE
As Book lapses back into sleep. Rachel hasn't removed her
hand from his chest. Abruptly she does so.
She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her,
so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises,
scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one
shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious
Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at
first, then the words take shape  swear words; curses; fuck
this and that; shit; etc. Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks
coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth.
She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind
her.
He's on the phone:
SCHAEFFER
Looks like we're going to need some
help from you folks down there.
Where an UNDERSHERIFF is on the phone:
UNDERSHERIFF
...want to help any way we can, Chief,
but you got to understand we've got
upwards of seven thousand Amish over
here.
And that's just Lancaster County.
INTERCUT SCHAEFFER
Who is trying to control his impatience:
SCHAEFFER
I've got the woman's name, Sheriff.
Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should
simplify your work.
The Undersheriff frowns. He doesn't like being talked down
to.
UNDERSHERIFF
How about an address?
SCHAEFFER
Ah... no.
UNDERSHERIFF
(frowns)
Maybe a road or route number?
SCHAEFFER
Sorry.
The Undersheriff is not impressed.
UNDERSHERIFF
Problem is, Chief, 'bout every third
Amishman around here is named Lapp.
That or Yoder. Or Hochstetler.
(and)
Chief, if the Amish have taken your
man in, I wouldn't want to hang from
a rope until you find him.
ANGLE
Schaeffer is tight-lipped with contained fury:
SCHAEFFER
Thank you, Sheriff. It's been an
education.
He hangs up. A beat; the man is a study in frustration. Then
he glances up.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Standing in his doorway are the two plainclothesmen who
spotted Carter in Book's office in the earlier scene. And...
CUT TO:
As the rather worrisome Hershberger frowns:
HERSHBERGER
...but a gunshot wound. Very serious.
TSCHANTZ
It is not the first time we have
done this. In the Englischer war of
the revolution, old Elmer Miller's
grandfather took in gunshot English
soldiers.
(a tad of pride)
Saved them, too.
They all nod. What Tschantz says is well known. Then:
ERB
Still, he should be among his own
people.
Rachel enters on this last.
RACHEL
He'll leave as soon as he is able.
He already wants to go.
Hershberger gives her a gloomy look, turns to Stoltzfus:
HERSHBERGER
How long will that be, Stoltzfus?
STOLTZFUS
(shrugs)
A month. Maybe less. With God's
healing love.
As Schaeffer opens the door, climbs in, sinks wearily into
the seat, beside McElroy.
MCELROY
She say where he is?
SCHAEFFER
I don't think she knows.
Schaeffer is staring grimly ahead.
SCHAEFFER
What about Carter?
MCELROY
Tight. But I'm working on him.
SCHAEFFER
Lean on him.
As Samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan. Book is lying asleep
on the bed.
Samuel puts the bedpan down, checks to make sure Book is
indeed asleep, then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed
and opens the clothes chest.
ANGLE
Book's big .38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded
clothes.
Fascinated, Samuel picks it up, admiring the heavy burled
pistol grips. Unable to resist, he starts to remove the weapon
from the holster, then pauses to steal a look. OFF SCREEN...
BOOK
His eyes are open and watching Samuel icily, which gives the
boy something of a jolt.
BOOK
Give me that.
Mutely, Samuel hands Book the pistol from arm's length. He
looks on as Book takes the pistol out of the holster, shoots
the boy another look, then snaps open the cylinder and shakes
out the heavy, copper-jacketed bullets into his palm. He
snaps the cylinder closed again, then nods to Samuel.
BOOK
Come here.
The boy edges closer.
BOOK
You ever handle a pistol like this,
Samuel?
SAMUEL
(swallows)
No pistol. Ever.
BOOK
Tell you what  I'm going to let you
handle this one. But only if you
promise not to say anything to your
momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't
understand.
SAMUEL
(grins)
Okay, Mr. Book.
Book smiles. Then he gives the boy a playful, John Wayne-
tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol,
demonstrating the action.
He finally hands it over to Samuel, butt first.
BOOK
Call me John.
The boy tries to imitate Book's one-handed expertise, but
his hands are too small. Book smiles.
Samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked, using two
hands, and Book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so
that it's not pointed at him.
BOOK
You don't want to point that at people
you just started calling by their
first name.
Samuel levels the pistol at the door and, just as he snaps
the trigger, Rachel enters, pulls up short in some dismay to
find her son has a gun pointed at her. Samuel blanches and
Book winces, knowing there's heavy weather ahead.
RACHEL
(snaps)
Samuel!
Samuel quickly hands the pistol back to Book, who holsters
it:
RACHEL
Wait for me downstairs.
Samuel quickly exits, and Rachel angrily advances on Book.
RACHEL
John Book, I would appreciate it if,
during the time you are with us, you
would have as little to do with Samuel
as possible.
BOOK
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was
curious. I unloaded the gun -
RACHEL
It's not the gun. Don't you
understand... It's you. What you
stand for.
(and)
That is not for Samuel.
Book looks at her thoughtfully.
Rachel softens a bit:
RACHEL
Please, it has nothing to do with
you personally.
He hands her the holstered gun and the loose bullets.
BOOK
Put it up someplace Samuel can't get
it.
A beat, then Rachel, takes the pistol and starts to go. Book
stops her:
BOOK
Friends?
Rachel glances back at him, smiles and nods. And...
CUT TO:
Book's holstered gun and bullets at center table. Eli sits
on one side, a chastened Samuel on the other. Rachel looks
on from the b.g.
Eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will
ever have with his grandson: at issue is one of the central
pillars of the Amish way.
ELI
The gun  that gun of the hand  is
for the taking of human life. Would
you kill another man? Eh?
Samuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes. Eli
leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially.
ELI
What you take into your hands, you
take into your heart.
A beat, then Samuel musters some defiance.
SAMUEL
I would only kill a bad man.
ELI
Only a bad man. I see. And you know
these bad men on sight? You are able
to look into their hearts and see
this badness?
SAMUEL
I can see what they do.
Now he meets Eli's eyes:
SAMUEL
I have seen it.
Eli expels a deep sigh; then:
ELI
And having seen, you would become
one of them?
(intent... gesturing)
Don't you see...? The hand leads the
arm leads the shoulder leads the
head... leads the heart. The one
goes into the other into the other
into the other... And you have
changed, and gone amongst them...
He breaks off, bows his head for a moment. Then he fixes the
boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly
into the tabletop with enormous intensity:
ELI
"Wherefore come out from among them
and be ye separate, saith the Lord!"
ELI
(indicating pistol;
continuing from
Corinthians 6:17)
"And touch not the unclean thing!"
His intensity tinged with righteous anger, he is hugely
impressive.
Book stands at the window in a worn robe. Below, through the
window, we can see Samuel and Eli in the barnyard. A beat,
then Book crosses impatiently back to his bed, sits down,
picks up a dog-earred copy of The American Dairyman. There's
a stack of well-thumbed farm magazines and copies of The
Budget (the Amish newspaper) on the bedside table.
There's a knock. Rachel enters carrying a pile of clothing.
She smiles.
RACHEL
Enjoying your reading?
BOOK
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot
about manure.
(eyes the clothing)
What's that?
RACHEL
Your shirt and jacket are still
stained with blood. I have them
soaking.You can wear these.
She passes the clothes to Book.
BOOK
Your husband's?
RACHEL
Yes. It's good that someone can have
the use of them. Besides, in your
clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
She continues, cheerfully.
RACHEL
I should tell you these do not have
buttons.
(shows him)
See? Hooks and eyes.
BOOK
Something wrong with buttons?
RACHEL
Buttons are Hochmut.
BOOK
Hochmut?
RACHEL
Vain. Proud. Such a person is
Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
BOOK
(nodding)
Anything against zippers?
RACHEL
(almost blushing)
You make fun of me. Like the tourists.
Driving by all the time. Some even
come into the yard. Very rude. They
seem to think we are quaint.
BOOK
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
She smiles.
BOOK
Where's the nearest telephone?
RACHEL
Telephone? The Gunthers across the
valley. They're Mennonite. They have
cars and refrigerators and telephones
in the houses even.
BOOK
No. I'd want a public phone.
Rachel's face clouds.
RACHEL
Well... the store at Saltzburg...
(then briskly)
But you won't be going to Saltzburg
for a while.
BOOK
I'm going this morning.
RACHEL
But Stoltzfus said...
BOOK
(cutting in)
I know what he said.
RACHEL
You can go with Eli. He's taking
Samuel to school. But you'll have to
hurry.
Rachel turns to leave when Book calls her back.
BOOK
Rachel.
She turns to look at him. It's the first time he's used her
name.
BOOK
Thanks.
She smiles and leaves.
Rachel washing dishes turns on hearing Book enter. She laughs
out loud at the sight of him in his Amish gear, and rightly
so  the pants are highwater, the hat low-rise, the jacket
ill-fitting.
Book looks self-conscious, even a little sheepish.
Outside another SHOUT from Eli.
RACHEL
You'd better go.
Book looks embarrassed.
BOOK
My... eh... gun?
The smile fades from Rachel's face as she reaches up into a
cupboard. She passes the gun in its holster to Book. He
fastens it about him. The contradiction of an "Armed Amishman"
increases the awkwardness between them. Book turns his back
to her and checks the weapon. He turns back to her smiling
in an odd way.
BOOK
The... bullets?
RACHEL
Oh. The bullets.
She takes them out of a disused coffee jar, passes them to
Book.
BOOK
(attempting a joke)
Not much good without them.
Samuel sits between Eli and Book. Both men stare straight
ahead.
Eli looks particularly stern. It's pretty clear he doesn't
like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith.
Book on the telephone waiting for his call to be answered.
He looks about him  several Amish and Dithers mingle in the
shop.
Book-has gotten a coke from a machine, seems a bit self-
conscious shout it sips at it surreptitiously... A voice
comes on the line; it's that of Book's partner.
CARTER
Yeah?
A silence.
BOOK
It's me.
CARTER
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
BOOK
Never mind. I'm coming in to take
care of business. How hot am I?
CARTER
(low, urgent)
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
BOOK
I'm coming.
CARTER
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything
stupid. You couldn't get within a
mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay
put... Stay in touch  I'll let you
know when maybe it makes sense.
A beat as Book considers that.
CARTER
(edgily)
You hear me?
BOOK
(finally)
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
CARTER
That's more like it.
(and)
Where are you at, anyway?
Book allows himself a small smile, regarding his Amish image
reflected in the window of the store.
BOOK
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
CARTER
(uncomprehending)
Say again?
BOOK
Make that 1790.
He hangs up. A beat, then he stares toward the door of the
store.
Book works on his car. The battery has gone flat and he's
trying to charge it up by running wires to a battery mounted
under the front seat of the Lapp buggy.
Eli stands at the barn door staring at him, again the
disapproving look.
ELI
If you are well enough to do that
thing, you can do work for me.
Book is genuinely apologetic.
BOOK
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind
me plugging in to your battery. Mine's
dead... How can I help? What can I
do?
ELI
Maybe milking.
BOOK
(eyes Eli)
Milking?
ELI
Cows. You know, cows?
BOOK
I've seen pictures.
ELI
Good, you start tomorrow.
Where Book lies asleep. A beat, then Eli comes in carrying a
lamp.
He pauses a moment to peer at the sleeping figure with
undisguised anticipation. Then he gives him a jarring thump:
ELI
(briskly)
Veck oufl. Time for milking.
Book comes groggily awake as Eli exits. He gropes for his
watch.
INSERT WATCHFACE
It reads 4:30 a.m.
BACK TO BOOK
As he stares at it in disbelief.
As the milk herd of half dozen or so cows ambles in with
Samuel prodding them along, headed for the milking stalls.
Book looks on in the lamplight, nonplused.
SAMUEL
Where he's pitching hay into the cow's feed-troughs.
BOOK, ELI
Where the old man is showing Book how to milk a cow by hand.
We see Rachel watching from the milkhouse door (steam from
scalding milk cans rising behind her).
ELI
Good, firm twist and pull, eh?
(and)
Right. Now you try it.
Book gives him a look, takes over the milking stool. The cow
shoots him a rather skeptical look over her shoulder. Book
bends to his task.
ELI
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You
never had your hands on a teat before?
BOOK
(grimly)
Not one this big.
Eli unexpectedly finds this hilarious, cackles, gives Book a
comradely, man-of-the-world thump on the shoulder that jars
him.
Then he moves off. Book bends to his task, and...
ANGLE  RACHEL
Grinning, giggling, covering her mouth with one hand.
As he pours a pail full of milk into a large, stainless steel
milk can.
ANGLE FAVORING Luke, one of Eli's team of fine mules as Samuel
opens the stall gate. The beast is skittish, obviously
afflicted with something of a behavioral problem.
But he allows Samuel to lead him out.
BOOK, ELI
As Samuel brings Luke out. Eli is now harnessing the other
mule of the team to a large manure-spreader. But as Luke
nears Book, his eyes widen and he shies, almost hauling Samuel
off his feet.
BOOK
(alarmed)
Careful, son 
Book moves to Samuel's aid; a gesture which proves a serious
mistake. Luke erupts into a SCREAMING, bucking cyclone. Samuel
 who no doubt has been here before  dives nimbly for cover
as a flying hoof nearly takes Book's head off.
Then Eli hustles into the fray, pushing Book aside as he
BELLOWS belligerently in German at the rearing animal. Finally
he gives Luke a swat upside the head that seems, somehow, to
have the effect of quieting the beast instantly.
ANGLE
Samuel gives the shaken Book a look:
SAMUEL
That's Luke. He doesn't like
strangers.
BOOK
(still shaken)
You don't say.
Eli leads the pacified mule back to the traces, grunting at
Book.
ELI
Have to teach you mules, too, I guess.
CUT TO:
Book works on repairing the broken birdhouse when Rachel
enters.
BOOK
He uses a drawknife on a piece of 2x4, with some obvious
expertise.
RACHEL
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the
district. He and his father built
the big house themselves forty years
ago.
BOOK
Oh?
(and)
What happened to Hochstetler?
RACHEL
We had some lemonade and he left.
BOOK
A real fireball.
Rachel smiles. Book crosses to a workbench and selects another
tool.
RACHEL
You know carpentry?
BOOK
I did some carpentry summers when I
was going to school.
RACHEL
What else can you do?
BOOK
(really annoyed)
I can whack people. I'm hell at
whacking.
RACHEL
Whacking is not of much use on a
farm.
BOOK
Now hold on. There's a lot of people
who think being a cop is a legitimate
job.
RACHEL
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
She turns, starts to go. Then turns back, eyeing his makeshift
garb:
RACHEL
Tonight I'll let out those trousers
for you.
Stifling a smile, she goes. HOLD on Book a beat, then...
CUT TO:
Eli is seated at the head of the table, Book opposite Samuel
and Rachel. The table is piled high with an incredible amount
of food.
Eli eyes Book cagily, waves his fork at him:
ELI
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with
your appetite?
BOOK
Guess I'm not used to so much.
ELI
(snorts)
Not used to hard work. That's what
makes an appetite.
Book swallows that one. With difficulty. Rachel intervenes:
RACHEL
Eli, John is a carpenter.
(conciliatory
afterthought)
As well as being a fine policeman.
ELI
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to
Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how
good a carpenter.
Book can't refuse the challenge.
BOOK
Sure.
RACHEL
But... You may not be well enough.
BOOK
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus'
tea.
As Rachel, lamp in hand, walks up to the barn. She looks in
to find Book tinkering with the battery hookup to the Lapp
buggy.
He glances up as she enters:
BOOK
Hi...
As she sets her lamp down near the one he's using.
RACHEL
(beat)
When will you be going?
BOOK
Not long... A few days.
Another beat as Rachel watches him... Book, checking out the
battery power, hits the radio  and suddenly from the
Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major
inventions  rock and roll.
It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more
even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's
his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous
as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in
Amish.
Rachel can't help but laugh... Sensing her response, Book
sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel
alternately protesting and laughing.
BOOK
You like it... Don't you?
Rachel, confused, protests:
RACHEL
No... You just stop 
But she doesn't really want to. Book grins:
BOOK
(mock alarm)
Next thing you know you'll be off
drinking beer and racing motorcycles.
And it goes on... Rachel alternately protesting and laughing.
ANGLE  THE BARN DOOR
As Eli suddenly appears. He glowers for an instant,
thunderstruck, then BELLOWS:
ELI
Rachel!
THE SCENE
As Book and Rachel's dancing comes to a sudden halt. Both
turn, look at Eli. Rachel regards him level-eyed, without
discernible alarm. Book, looking a bit sheepish, goes over,
turns off the radio, as:
ELI
(in the dialect)
What is this? This Myusick?
Book hesitates, then starts to say something:
BOOK
It's not her fault. I 
But he gets such a look from Eli that he turns, goes out.
ELI
(in the dialect)
How can this be? How can you do such
a thing? Is this plain? Is this the
ordnung?
RACHEL
I have done nothing against the
ordnung.
ELI
(in the dialect)
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this
man to our house. With his gun of
the hand. You bring fear to this
house. Fear of English with guns
coming after. You bring blood and
whispers of more blood. Now English
music... and you are dancing to
English music! And you call this
nothing?
RACHEL
I have committed no sin.
ELI
(in English)
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel,
it does not look...
(tone softening... in
the dialect)
Don't you know there has been talk?
Talk about you, not him. Talk about
going to the Bishop. About having
you... shunned!
RACHEL
That is idle talk.
ELI
(in English, pleading)
Do not make light of it, Rachel.
They can do it... quick! Like that!
And then... then I can not sit at
table with you. I can not take a
thing from your hand. I... I can not
go with you to meeting!
(the old man almost
breaks down as, in
the dialect)
Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go
too far! Dear child!
Rachel is annoyed  also touched, no doubt, by the old man's
plea  but irked by his condescending tone.
RACHEL
I am not a child.
ELI
(suddenly stern again)
You are acting like one!
RACHEL
I will be the judge of that.
ELI
(fierce as a prophet)
No! They will be the judge of that!
And so will I... if you shame me!
RACHEL
(blinking a tear now,
but meeting his gaze)
You shame yourself.
And shaken  but proud and erect  she turns and walks out.
Carter sits, Schaeffer prowls... slowly, letting silences
grow before he strikes again with another softly-snarled
question or statement.
SCHAEFFER
You know where he is.
CARTER
Wrong.
SCHAEFFER
You'd lie to protect him.
CARTER
(cool)
Probably.
Schaeffer snaps around, glares at him.
SCHAEFFER
You admit you're lying?
CARTER
(shakes head)
I admit I don't know where he is.
SCHAEFFER
You're the first one he'll contact.
CARTER
(sighing)
He's got my number.
Schaeffer stops, stands in front of Carter, takes a deep
breath... suddenly smiles. And is abruptly (as he is capable
of being) the man of charm and gentlemanly reason. He even
CHUCKLES as he begins:
SCHAEFFER
It's funny. I know he's hiding
somewhere with the Amish, I know it.
(a quick glance at
Carter)
Can you imagine John Book at a prayer
meeting? Our John Book?
Schaeffer CHUCKLES again, looks hopefully again at Carter.
Carter looks back, stony-eyed. Schaeffer makes another abrupt
shift in form... but still speaks softly.
SCHAEFFER
Either you're a member of the club
or you aren't, Elton.
(he nods his head, as)
Tell me what you know...
CARTER
What I know, Paul, is...
(nodding his head)
He's going to take you out...
As he goes into the barn.
Book approaches Luke's stall warily... and as he does so the
temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his
hooves CRACKING against the walls of the stall. Book flinches.
Book starts to talk gently to the animal:
BOOK
All right, you nasty son of a bitch,
we're going to be friends whether
you like it or not.
Then, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall
gate.
ANGLE
As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket,
brings out some lumps of sugar.
BOOK
See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't
you for Christ's sake?
Finally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends
to eat. Book nods with satisfaction.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Rachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled
expression.
RACHEL
(surprised)
Well...
Book turns, grins with some pride of accomplishment!
BOOK
Won him over just like that.
RACHEL
I see.
(and)
But I hope you have a lot of sugar.
(then, going)
Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
Just then Luke skitters impatiently... Book gives him a
nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him
skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go:
BOOK
Later.
And we...
Where Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is
pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub.
She replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of
her camisole. Naked, she folds the garment across the back
of a chair.
Then she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath.
RACHEL'S POV  FRYING PAN
The gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over
the stove with other cookware, we can see Book's image
reflected there, framed in the kitchen doorway.
BACK TO SCENE
Rachel hesitates for a moment  and in that moment she makes
a choice.
Slowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his
eyes.
And for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of
eve... a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become,
for an instant, a woman of Book's world.
BOOK
As he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable
to make it happen.
And suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes,
picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting
it on, looks away.
BOOK
TIGHTENING to him, and...
CUT TO:
Rachel is driving, Book sitting next to her. Samuel is in
the back, looking out the rear window and not paying any
attention to the adults.
A beat, then a large produce truck roars past them. It's all
Book can do to keep from flinching.
Rachel stares straight ahead. Book glances at her.
BOOK
Maybe I ought to learn to drive this
thing.
Rachel says nothing.
BOOK
(beat)
Pick myself up another useful skill.
Now Rachel can't help but smile. She looks at him. And...
As Rachel eyes the other buggy through the windshield.
RACHEL
Samuel, who is that?
Samuel checks out the buggy.
SAMUEL
It looks like Hochstetler's mare.
As Rachel waves at the occupants of the other buggy; Daniel
returns her greeting:
BOOK
(teasing her)
Uh oh, they're leaving us behind.
Rachel gives him a look, and... gives the reins a flick 
the race is on.
RACE MONTAGE
Hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together
with his young sister  at first they're not aware of the
race, until Daniel can contain his excitement no longer and
gives his horse a couple of whoops. The buggies are neck and
neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly.
It's all Book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off
Rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she
gains the edge and pulls ahead of Hochstetler, to the cheers
of Samuel and Book.
Rachel is browsing among the stocked shelves in the company
of a young Amish woman, Ellie Beiler. Rachel is carrying
Ellie's tiny baby, and the infant is getting as much attention
as the shopping.
Book is standing at a wall pay phone in the b.g. We TIGHTEN
to him, and...
BOOK
Lieutenant Elton Carter, please.
A beat, then we hear the FILTERED VOICE of the Philadelphia
Police Department switchboard:
VOICE
Are you a member of the family?
BOOK
What? I'm a friend of his.
VOICE
I'm sorry. Last night Sergeant Carter
was killed in the line of duty...
Book hangs up. His breathing is thrown out by the shock of
the news and he takes a couple of deep breaths to regain
control. He hesitates, unsure of his next move. He makes to
move away, then he turns back, finds more coins and dials a
second number.
Schaeffer's wife answers the phone; she is momentarily
shocked.
She calls for her husband, then makes polite conversation.
MRS. SCHAEFFER
How are you, John?
Paul Schaeffer appears, slightly irritated at being called
away from the Saturday afternoon game.
MRS. SCHAEFFER
(covering mouthpiece)
John Book!
SCHAEFFER
I'll take it in the study.
Schaeffer takes the phone.
SCHAEFFER
You can hang up, dear.
We HEAR the click of the other phone,
BOOK
You made a mistake, Paul. You
shouldn't have taken Elton out.
SCHAEFFER
(beat)
How bad did Mac get you? We figured
pretty bad.
BOOK
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long
time. That's what I called to tell
you.
SCHAEFFER
(quickly)
Johnny 
BOOK
You might want to pass it along to
Mac.
SCHAEFFER
(urgently)
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're
out there all alone... We're getting
close... real close... Maybe if you
listen to me for a minute we can
work something out so you can come
in 
BOOK
I've already got something worked
out.
(and)
Be seeing you.
Book hangs up the phone and the dead CLICK registers on
Schaeffer.
Book has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second
to unclench his fist. Then it takes something else to resist
his first impulse, which is to smash out at something...
Training. Get it under control. Deal rationally with the
situation.
He straightens his jacket, wipes the sweat/tears from his
eyes, turns and walks stiffly out of the Saltzburg General
Store.
Book, as Rachel eyes him. She has noticed his changed mood,
but doesn't ask about it. He stares straight ahead, oblivious
to the surroundings of the street, now crawling with tourists
and traffic.
As Rachel approaches the scene, slowing down and finally
stopping.
Rachel is at first puzzled, then makes a small face, looks
at Book.
Rachel puts a restraining hand on Book's arm.
RACHEL
Do nothing. This happens from time
to time.
She senses him about to get out, grips his arm tightly.
RACHEL
It's not our way, John. We'll have
nothing to do with violence! John!
Book shakes free, gets out and slowly walks toward the...
Eli is lighting the lamps. Samuel reads a book at the kitchen
table. Rachel moves slowly to the sink and begins washing a
few dishes. She looks out the window.
CLOSE on her face, a strange expression.
The distant figure of Book working on the birdhouse.
CLOSE on Rachel's hands, lifting items slowly up and of the
water to the draining board, where she places them carefully
down. She shakes the water off her hands.
CLOSE on her face, still staring fixedly out the window. She
speaks without turning around.
RACHEL
Eli, would you see Samuel to bed?
The old man glances at her; this is not their routine.
A booth, where Schaeffer and McElroy and Fergie, a Lancaster
County Undersheriff and his SHERIFF  an expansive politician
type  are seated.
The Undersheriff eyes Schaeffer narrowly. The Sheriff has a
county map spread out on the table, amid breakfast dishes,
pointing directions to Schaeffer:
SHERIFF
There... White Oak Road a couple of
miles before it ties into two-twenty-
two. Got it?
SCHAEFFER
Got it. We owe you one, Sheriff.
SHERIFF
My man Holmes here put it together.
Fine officer, Chief. He spoke to the
doctor at the hospital.
SCHAEFFER
Undersheriff Holmes and I have talked
on the phone.
(nods at Holmes)
Good work.
UNDERSHERIFF
Sure you don't want us to post some
backup units?
SCHAEFFER
If we need any help, we'll give you
a shout. I'd like to slip in there
quiet, then get out before we attract
any attention.
Where Eli is getting into a heavy coat, preparing to go out...
the remains of the hearty morning breakfast are on the table.
Rachel is beginning the dishes.
Book and Samuel are starting the morning milking...
Eli is preparing to extinguish the lamp when suddenly the
kitchen door is kicked open and McElroy and Fergie weapons
leveled, burst in. Eli reacts with angry shock as Schaeffer
enters: Rachel is, for a moment, terrified.
SCHAEFFER
(to Fergie)
Outside 
(to Mac)
Check out the rest of the house.
He turns to Eli, who is standing in the middle of the room.
Schaeffer flashes his badge:
SCHAEFFER
We're police officers. We're looking
for a fugitive, John Book. He's living
here?
ELI
I have nothing to say to you. Get
out of my house!
SCHAEFFER
You speak English. Good. Now listen

RACHEL
(recovering)
No, you listen. Get out!
SCHAEFFER
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man
is very dangerous. An armed criminal.
(ingratiating)
He's got a gun, hasn't he?
RACHEL
You have no right here!
McElroy re-enters.
MCELROY
He's not in this building.
SCHAEFFER
(to Eli)
All right, where is he?
Suddenly Eli SHOUTS: It's deafening. Probably the loudest
noise Eli has ever made:
ELI
John Book!
McElroy whips around, smashes Eli on the temple with the
butt of his shotgun. Eli crumples to the floor. Rachel
SCREAMS, runs to Eli.
Book and Samuel in the milkhouse. They've heard Eli's outcry.
Book moves to the window, looks out.
BOOK'S POV  FERGIE
About halfway between the barn and the house. He turns from
glancing back toward the house (having heard Eli's shout)
and starts again toward the barn. Gun at the ready.
As Book REACTS.
Rachel kneeling next to Eli, wiping at his bruise with a
damp cloth. Schaeffer looks on.
SCHAEFFER
He'll live.
RACHEL
You might have killed him!
SCHAEFFER
(to McElroy)
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll
watch these two.
McElroy nods, moves outside, turns toward the barns.
Book still at the window, Samuel now beside him, trying to
get a look.
SAMUEL
Is it them?
BOOK
(turning, mind racing)
It's them, Sam.
(he bends to the boy,
takes him by the
shoulders)
Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to
me carefully. Listen to me as you
never listened before.
SAMUEL
(interrupting)
Are they going to kill you?
BOOK
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go
across the new corn to Stoltzfus'.
Run as fast as you can. And stay
there!
SAMUEL
What are you going to do?
BOOK
I'll be all right. You just do as I
say.
He takes Samuel by the hand, leads him to the side door. He
bends, holds the boy close.
SAMUEL
Don't let them hurt you.
BOOK
(rising, pushing Samuel
toward door)
I won't. Now run.
(as Sam looks back)
Fast as you can!
Sam turns, takes off.
Book, at another window in the lower barn, sees McElroy
heading for the milkhouse door. He can't see Fergie. He turns,
crosses the cowpen area, climbs an inner ladder leading to
the upper barn.
Beyond Book, now at the top of the ladder, we see Fergie
easing into the barn. Book pulls himself up, crawls behind
the wall of the mule stalls, opens gate, eases in beside
Luke, urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm
him. He gets to the animal's head, crouches, strokes Luke's
nose. The mule's huge flanks quiver, his nostril's and eyes
widen, but he makes no untoward sound. Book closes the gate.
BACK TO FERGIE
He comes on warily, muzzle first, eyes darting.
DOLLYING WITH him as he reaches the first mule's stall, opens
the gate. An edgy mule turns, eyes him, shuffles nervously.
Fergie backs off, moves on.
BOOK
As he listens, tenses, hearing Fergie's feet in the fresh
straw.
Book eases back alongside Luke, waits.
BACK TO FERGIE
As he approaches Luke's stall, reaches for the gate-latch.
BOOK  FLASH CUT
As the gate swings open, Book shouts and gives Luke a whack
on the back. The mule's pent-up nerves and feral energy
explode in an horrendous SCREAM.
FERGIE
Bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies
open, involuntarily FIRING, suddenly finding himself under
the lethal hooves of a twelve-hundred pound beast. Staggering
backwards, he SCREAMS, FIRES again, the load striking the
mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into
Fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half
like a matchstick.
BOOK
As he slips out of the stall, ducks toward the rear of the
barn.
FERGIE
Fallen, skull smashed... and now the dying Luke's legs buckle
and he collapses atop Fergie.
Rachel has moved into the open kitchen door, glances anxiously
toward the barns. Starts out. Schaeffer pushes her back.
SCHAEFFER
Get back in there.
RACHEL
My son is out there!
SCHAEFFER
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
McElroy flattens himself against the wall, looks around
fearfully.
MCELROY
(softly)
Fergie?
Only silence.
Eli now seated at the table, holding a cloth to his head.
Rachel at a window, peering out. Schaeffer on the porch
McElroy, moving very cautiously, comes around the mule stalls,
stops short, stares off screen.
HIS POV  FERGIE
Where he lies half buried beneath the huge bulk of the mule,
his head crushed like an eggshell.
BACK TO MCELROY
As he moves on around Fergie and the dead mule, planting
each foot as if he were walking in a mine field.
BOOK
Standing in shadow at the back of the barn next to a hay
mow.
HIS POV  MCELROY
Moving toward the center of the barn.
BOOK
As he starts to move even further back, he nudges into a
rope fastened to the wall behind him, He looks at it, looks
up.
HIS POV  THE ROPE
It runs from where it is fastened to the wall straight up to
the center roofbeam of the barn to a trolley fixed to a track
that runs the length of the roofbeam. Attached to this trolley
is a big hayfork (Paul Krantz has one), U-shaped, sharply-
pointed at each end of the U. the points hanging toward the
floor. The thing weighs about eighty pounds, and is suspended
in place by the rope anchored at the wall next to Book.
BACK TO BOOK
Keeping one eye on McElroy, he carefully begins to un-tie
the trip rope.
MCELROY
Moving out toward the center of the barn, almost under the
suspended hay fork. He stops short, listens. Then, either
spotting a moving shadow or hearing a SOUND, he FIRES. His
shot rattles off the side of a manure spreader. He SHOUTS:
MCELROY
Book, you sneaky bastard, I know
you're here! Come out and fight!
Book watches as McElroy starts to move again looking back
toward the SOUNDING of the bell.
HIGH ANGLE  HAY FORK
Looking down we can see McElroy almost directly beneath the
hay fork. The bell SOUNDING throughout. BOOK Waiting... trip
rope in hand. Then:
BOOK
(shouting)
Hey, Mac!
And he lets go the trip rope.
MCELROY
As he turns toward the SOUND of Book's voice.
HAY FORK
As it plummets down, causing a RATCHETING SOUND that fills
the barn, even drowns out the SOUND of the bell.
MCELROY
Eyes darting wildly, looking up.
HIS POV  HAY FORK
Plunging straight for him.
MCELROY
Diving to one side.
ANGLE  HAY FORK
THUDDING into the barn floor like a great trident fork.
Quivering there, not a foot from McElroy's head.
MCELROY
Staring at the fork pop-eyed.
BOOK
Sprinting toward a ladder thrust up through an opening in
the barn floor just in front of his parked car.
MCELROY
Spotting Book, coming up to one knee, quick-aiming, FIRING.
The shot smashes the windshield of the car.
BOOK
Diving, rolling, slamming into the top of the ladder, flailing
down out of sight.
MCELROY
FIRING AGAIN, then again. Emptying the gun, cursing as he
begins to reload, gets to his feet, starts toward the ladder.
The BELL still SOUNDING outside. The hood of the car SLOWLY
POPS UP.
ANGLE
As McElroy wheels at the movement of the car's hood, FIRES
twice.
MCELROY'S POV  LAPP BUGGY
The buckshot virtually blows the dashboard off.
McElroy at the top of the ladder, looking down. Then easing
over, placing his feet on the rungs.
BOOK
He stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. The
cows stare balefully at him. A large goat nuzzles him, hooks
at him with its horns. Book waits, watches.
HIS POV  MCELROY
Visible to his knees as he eases down the ladder. He stops
at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering
the rungs.
BACK TO BOOK
He turns now to a door at the back of the pen. He un-hooks
it, pulls it open, moves inside.
ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK
He is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to
a nearly-empty silo. Above the entrance, a ladder (interior)
rises to the top of the structure.
Book looks in, and up. We should get the impression that
Book's been here before, expects what he sees.
WHAT HE SEES
Forty feet up, a patch of blue sky through an open hatch.
BACK TO BOOK
He steps through to the base of the ladder, then ducks beyond
it into the silo. There is about two feet of old silage
covering the floor. He turns, looks up the white walls.
HIS POV  INSIDE SILO
An inside ladder runs to the top.
HIS POV  KICKBOARD
Standing against the wall next to the entrance... . obviously
to be inserted as the silo is filled.
BOOK
Now, quickly, he ducks back out through the entrance, crosses
to the door to the cowpen, very cautiously peers out..
WHAT HE SEES
McElroy at the bottom of the ladder, looking in the other
direction (toward the milkhouse).
BACK TO BOOK
Very carefully he shoves the cowpen door (which opens outward
into the cowpen). It begins to swing very slowly open. Book
immediately turns, darts back into the silo.
MCELROY
Turning slowly toward the cowpen... then FIRES twice as his
eye catches the motion of the swinging door. His shots blow
half a row of Eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall.
McElroy reloads, starts across toward the door.
Old Eli, at the sight of Samuel, rises from the table.
ELI
Praise Gott!
Rachel stands aside as the old man embraces Samuel long and
hard.
She watches as he turns to the cupboard, takes down the big
family Bible. He crosses to the table, sets the book down,
places his hand on its pulls Samuel to the table beside him.
Rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man
helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid Book's gun,
takes it down... her trembling hands take the bullets out of
the coffee jar. She drops several as she tries to figure out
how to open the chamber to load it.
In the b.g., Eli glances up, sees what she is about... he
rises and crosses to her. Samuel watches from the table.
ELI
(fiercely)
No, Rachel...
RACHEL
I have to help him!
Rachel somehow manages to open the chamber and begins to try
to load the bullets. Eli's callused hand closes over hers,
halting the action:
ELI
It is not our way!
Bullets are already CLATTERING to the floor from her trembling
fingers as she raises her eyes to Eli's.
A long beat as Rachel looks at him... Finally her fingers
release the pistol and it CLATTERS to the floor. She closes
her eyes.
Samuel, who has gotten up, moved to a window, watches Eli
and Rachel silently.
Eli leads her to the table, places her hands on the Bible
beneath his. They stand there and they pray.
Book finishes putting the kickboard into the entrance.
MCELROY
Moving among the cows, stepping cautiously between the
cowflops.
The goat nudges him once, then butts him rather firmly.
McElroy swats at him with the gun butt, moves to the door.
As he arrives, he HEARS a noise  very slight  from the
direction of the silo.
He enters the passage way, looks in toward the silo entrance,
He hesitates. Another slight noise. He steps in to the base
of the inner ladder, looks up.
HIS POV  THE HATCH
The patch of blue sky, forty feet up.
BACK TO MCELROY
He frowns, reaches out, grabs a rung.
Schaeffer, easing toward the mule stalls, MUTTERS, CURSES
under his breath. Then he rounds the corner of the first
stall... and there is Fergie with Luke the mule on top of
him. Schaeffer stares, blinks... moves on spotting a spent
shotgun shell near the hayfork...
Book listening at the kickboard. SOUNDS of feet, shotgun
rattling against metal rungs, Book moves to the ladder on
his side, starts silently up.
MCELROY
Climbing with difficulty, shotgun clutched in one hand.
BOOK
He climbs up to the second kickboard, pauses, checks the
distance to the floor, starts upward again.
BARN YARD  DAY
The Amish beginning to arrive. Sam comes running, pulls
Stoltzfus toward the door of the milkhouse as the other Amish
look at the shot-shattered bellrope. Rachel and Eli come
rapidly up the path toward the group.
Schaeffer finds another spent shotgun shell, crosses to the
ladder, looks down. He sets his shotgun down, takes out his
service revolver, starts down.
Book has reaches the third kickboard, about thirty feet from
the ground. He checks it, turns the thumb-screws that hold
it in place, places his hand on the handle, moves to one
side as best he can... hangs there, listening.
MCELROY
Rattling up the other ladder, approaching the third kickboard.
BOOK
Listening tensely, hearing McElroy arrive on the other side
of the kickboard. Then, deliberately, Book makes a fist,
raps on the board smartly once.
MCELROY
Startled, REACTING. He sets his feet, leans back against the
back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts
the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety.
BOOK
We HEAR with him the thump of the muzzle, the CLICK... and,
with marvelous speed, Book pulls the kickboard and drops it
to the floor.
McELROY  FLASH CUT Staring in, stun-eyed, already falling
forward (having leaned his weight on the shotgun) as Book
seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward.
ANOTHER ANGLE
As McElroy pitches forward through the opening, SCREAMS and
GRABS as he plunges past Book. The shotgun FIRES as McElroy
manages to hold onto Book, and both men plunge thirty feet
to the bottom of the silo.
BOOK
He falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies
stunned.
MCELROY
His forward motion has carried him across the silo. His head
bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up... and he
falls in a heap, blood gushing from his head, as...
TIGHT ON BOOK
Blinking, groaning, just beginning to stir... and, suddenly,
into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it. The muzzle
is placed firmly against Book's temple.
WIDER
Schaeffer holding the pistol. He cocks the pistol, tenses as
if to FIRE (and he is actually about to)... when there is a
SOUND behind him. He snaps around.
WHAT HE SEES
Old Stoltzfus and Samuel standing in the kickboard opening
(Schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the
shot from within the silo). They stand solemnly, looking on
as:
SCHAEFFER
He eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly:
SCHAEFFER
Okay, Johnny. On your feet.
THE SCENE
As Book struggles to his feet  Schaeffer holding the pistol
tight to Book's head. Book turns, sees Samuel and Stoltzfus,
blinks.
Schaeffer shoves Book toward the opening. As Book moves toward
Samuel, he speaks quietly:
BOOK
It's okay, Sam.
ANOTHER ANGLE
As Book and McElroy move out of the silo, down the passageway
toward the milkhouse, Stoltzfus and Sam (after a glance in
at the inert McElroy) follow and...
As Book drives, he sees an open buggy coming down the hill
toward the farm, He slows as he passes, It's Daniel
Hochstetler. A long beat, and as they pass, Hochstetler gives
Book an expansive tip of his hat.
Book turns to look back at his rival, a doubt in his eyes.
FREEZE FRAME.
FADE OUT
