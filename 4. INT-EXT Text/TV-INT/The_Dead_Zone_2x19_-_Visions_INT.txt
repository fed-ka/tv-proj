          Johnny mixes a drink at the wet bar.  Bruce watches him,
          a little worried.

                        A homeless guy?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe he's not homeless, who knows. 
                        The point is, this wasn't the
                        first time I've seen him.

          Johnny takes a drink.  He needs it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Seen him seen him, or...
                                (points to head)
                        Seen him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's not a vision, Bruce.  The
                        people in my visions usually don't
                        turn to look and talk to me...

          His voice trails off, uncertain.

                                        BRUCE
                        When was the first time you saw
                        him?

          Johnny thinks about it, draws a deep breath.

                        Why didn't you say anything about
                        this before?

          Johnny mimes holding a phone to his ear.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Bruce, what's goin' on?  Me? 
                        Oh, I just keep seeing this

                          ...Who's not a vision.

          Johnny suddenly becomes serious, showing signs of the
          strain these cumulative sightings have had on him.

                        I get visions off of touch, and I
                        wasn't touching anything.  If
                        you've got another theory, I'd
                        love to hear it.

                                        BRUCE
                        How about you've got someone
                          stalking you? 

          Johnny shakes his head, he doesn't think so.

                                        BRUCE
                        There's something you're not
                        telling me.  You said he yelled
                        at you.  What'd he say?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (covering)
                        It... was just rambling.  About
                        the end of the world.  Typical
                        crazy man at the fair stuff. 
                        Didn't make any sense.

          Bruce studies him, not convinced.



          Shooting down empty hallways, stairwells.  Anyone, anything
          could be lurking in the deep recesses of shadow.

          In the KITCHEN, we move in on the security monitor, now
          displaying a view of the darkened driveway.  Maybe we
          think we see something move, maybe not.



          Johnny pulls the cover off of the bulletin board with his
            articles, diagrams, and notes concerning the most important
          vision he's had... the vision of Armageddon.

          Johnny pulls up a chair and sits in front of the board,
          resting both of his hands on his cane.  He scans the board. 
          Pictures of Stillson, Purdy, the Washington Monument.

          Johnny's eyes rove past post-it notes like "Shady Pines -
          Need Witness", "Sonny Elliman," and "Satellite?" A
            patchwork of questions and media hieroglyphics, all leading
          to the very declarative photo of a MUSHROOM CLOUD.

                        there.

          The is voice right behind his ear.  Johnny's chair KNOCKS
          OVER as he SPRINGS UP, whirling around and holding his
          cane like a bat, ready to swing...

          The Homeless Man is standing on the upper landing of the
          basement stairs.

                        So this is where you study the
                        end of the world.

          Johnny tenses as he sees the man's hand in his coat pocket,
          possibly concealing a gun or a knife.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you want?

          Johnny has backed to his tool bench.  He scoops up a wicked
          looking Black and Decker POWER DRILL with 12 inch bit,
          pointing it at the Homeless Man. 

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        I want you to get in your car.  I

                        it's too late.

          The Man nods to the Armageddon board, and Johnny's eyes
          flick over to it.  Then, the Man turns and begins to walk
          up the stairs. 

          Johnny hurries up the stairs after him, drill in hand.          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT ONE - 06/25/03 - GREEN        9.



          Johnny stalks through his house, fear having released
          adrenaline and anger.  He's done with crackpots breaking
          into his home.  He moves deliberately, power drill leveled
          like a Magnum.  He reaches the front door.

          Not only is it locked, it's chained and dead-bolted.

          He checks the security system.  All lights are green. 
          Triggers a system check.  No reported breaches.

          Johnny stands there, baffled.



          Johnny descends the last few steps.  Crosses to the board. 
          He stands in silence for a beat, mind spinning.  Then, he
          takes a marker, and writes something on the board, right
          across the photo of the mushroom cloud.  

          He stands back to stare at what he's done. We see a sort
          of confusion creep into his eyes, followed by a dawning
            realization.  PER-LAP sound of a RINGING PHONE...

          provocative stretches, all in the name of nursing her
          Achilles tendon (which is in a support bandage) back to
          health.  He grimaces, on the phone with Johnny.

                        I'm pretty sure it is.

          In his room, Bruce turns back to the young woman, who
          manages a smile, even though she's vaguely in pain.

                                        YOUNG WOMAN
                        Think that's as far as I can go

                        I'll head out after lunch.

                        Thanks, Man.  Call me when you
                        get here.  I've gotta check
                          something out...

          Johnny hangs up and gets out of his Jeep.  He slips through
          the fence, into the site. 

          Johnny passes by Christopher's sports car.  As he touches
          it.  RAMP INTO JOHNNY'S FACE...



          Parked.  Christopher is in the driver's seat, which is
          reclined all the way back.  A HOT WOMAN, not his wife, is
          on top of him, her blouse undone.  They're going at it
          and JOHNNY watches from the back seat, a trapped voyeur.


  23B23BOUT OF VISION AND BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny pulls his hand away from the car, surprised.  He
          crouches down behind the Mercedes, and watches as Chris
          moves away from the Foreman.

          A WOMAN approaches Christopher.  The same woman from his
          vision, probably his SECRETARY.  Chris grins and pats her
          on the tush.  She reports something to him, and his smile
          disappears.  He asks her a question, and her answer makes
          him swear.  He moves off toward the market site.          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT TWO - 06/24/03 - PINK        17.



          Bruce enters the station, which is quiet but rather busy
          at the same time.  He looks around, apprehensive, then
          spots Johnny, sitting in front of a desk in the bullpen.

          Johnny sees Bruce, waves him over.  Bruce shakes his head,
          and goes.

          He's about to say something when a COP with a slight paunch
          returns to his desk, LT. SANDOWSKI.  He moves with a
          purposeful absence of haste.  He eyes Bruce as he sits.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Who's this?

                        Hi.

            Sandowski nods, writes something down on a pad.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Mind if I get your last name?

            uncomfortably at Johnny.

                          Caucasian male between the ages
                        of 35 and 45, who, with the
                          exception of burn marks on his
                        face, is the spitting image of
                          Christopher Wey.

          Bruce does a slow, what-the-fuck-have-you-been-up-to take
          toward Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I know you can't investigate
                        a crime that hasn't happened, but
                        I feel it's important you know
                        what I've seen. 

            Sandowski taps a pencil against his lips.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        You did the right thing coming in
                        here.  If you have any more
                          premonitions, such as the name of
                        the suspect, let us know.  Until
                        then, I suggest you let us handle
                        this.

          Johnny realizes he's getting the send off.  Sandowski
          looks down at his slip of paper.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Mr. Lewis, would you mind if I
                        got your contact information as
                        well?

          Off Bruce's reaction.


  3434OMITTED



          Johnny and Bruce sit on the couch, a little awkward. 
            Madeleine calls out from the kitchen.

                                        MADELEINE (O.S.)
                        Do you take ice, Bruce?

                                        BRUCE
                        Uh, no thanks.

          She comes out with two glasses of water.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Okay, let's talk.

          She hands a glass to Bruce first, then to Johnny.  As he
          touches it...


  3737VISION 

          CAMERA 360's around the glass of water, and Madeleine's
          wardrobe changes to another day.  Now she is handing the
          glass to another man... The ugly man we saw taking photos
          of Johnny at the construction site.  His name is LANCE
          FOSTER.  As Madeleine hands him an envelop of CASH...

                                        MADELEINE
                        I hope this covers your retainer.

                                        FOSTER
                        Son of a bitch doesn't deserve
                        you.

            Madeleine is made visibly uncomfortable by his tone.

                                        MADELEINE
                        I just need to know who she is. 
                        I need evidence.

                        I'll get the evidence.  You have
                        more ice? 

          He shakes his glass, the ice cubes clink, and the glass
            magically re-fills with water as we SWING OUT OF THE
          VISION.


  3838JOHNNY

          absorbs this while trying not to show it.

                                        MADELEINE
                        I've been thinking a lot about
                        your visit here the other day.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah?

                                        MADELEINE
                        Let me take a guess, and tell me
                        how close I am.  My husband is
                          cheating on me, and he's having
                        an affair with someone close to
                        you.  Maybe your wife, or
                          girlfriend.

                                        BRUCE
                        Wow.

          Bruce and Johnny are momentarily caught off guard. 
            Madeleine mistakenly believes that she's hit home.

                                        MADELEINE
                        The last time this happened, I
                        thought it was my fault.  I was
                        working full-time, and so was
                        Chris, and with Julia starting
                        school, I didn't have time to
                        take care of him...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Wey...

                                        MADELEINE
                        Madeleine. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Madeleine.  I do have something
                        to tell you, but, first, I have
                        to explain something about myself,
                        about who I am.  It may be...
                        hard to believe, but I hope you'll
                        hear me out.

            Madeleine looks back and forth between them, now unsure.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Alright...

                                        JOHNNY
                        About seven years ago, I was
                          involved in a car accident.

          Madeleine's demeanor shifts.  She tightens, visibly.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Wait, I'm sorry, does this have
                          anything to do with Christopher?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It has a great deal to do with
                        both of you.

          Madeleine's eyes dart left.  Johnny traces them to the
          phone on the wall.  Bruce notices, too.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I don't mean to frighten
                        you.

          But he already has.  And she's wondering, why did I let
          these strangers into my house?

                                        MADELEINE
                        What do you want?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What I have to tell you, is for
                        your own safety.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Are you saying that I'm not safe
                        now?

                                        JULIA (O.S.)
                        Hello.

          They all turn to see JULIA in the room.  Johnny smiles.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hi.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Julia, go to your room.

                                        JULIA
                        Okay.
                                (to Johnny)
                        What's your name?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Johnny.

            Madeleine stands up.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT TWO - 06/23/03 - BLUE        28.

                        Okay, let's go.

          Julia smiles at Johnny as her Mom heads for her.

                                        JULIA
                        Au revoir, Johnny.

          As Johnny is about to reply, as Madeleine takes Julia's
          hand, Johnny looks past her and sees THE HOMELESS MAN
          staring through the back window.

          Johnny drops his glass.  The Man, who we now see has tears
          in his eyes, moves out of sight.  Bruce follows Johnny's
          look to the window.

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's on the porch.  He's there,
                        he's right there!

          Bruce jumps into action, running for the French doors
          that lead to the back porch.  Johnny moves to follow.



          Johnny is in the brain trauma ward.  Utter SILENCE except
          for the intermittent beep of life support equipment.

          Johnny approaches a bed, and an eerily familiar sight:
          Christopher Wey, eyes closed, trapped within a coma.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were in a coma.

            Suddenly, the lighting in the room changes dramatically. 
          Johnny looks out the window, sees the sun setting at a
          time-lapse rate.  He walks toward the window.

          VFX SHOT   Johnny framed by the window, slowly approaching
          it as the sun continues to rise and set, ever faster. 
          Days ticking by and accelerating into months.  Faster...

          ON JOHNNY S FACE   As the breathtaking acceleration of
          time strobes across his eyes, faster than he can process...


    4444JOHNNY S POV OUT THE WINDOW   VFX EXTRAVAGANZA

          Months flying by.  Years.  The cityscape changing under
          the blurring cycle of day and night, and then all of a
          sudden BOOM!  It only lasts a few frames but we know what
          it is.

          FIRE.  Then --

  4545CLOSE ON WEY

          Sleeping outside, face covered by GREY SOOT.  He looks
          like a hibernating gargoyle.  His eyes blink open.  Then
          immediately shut as light stabs them.

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        Like I said, the last thing I
                          remember, was walking into my
                        house.  The next thing, was that
                        I couldn't see...

          It is SO BRIGHT he can't even squint.  Wey tries to lift
          himself out of the rubble he's lying in, and fails.  He
          tries again... and falls again.  He tries again... 

                                                                      WHITE FLASH TO:



          Johnny has drawn a diagram for Bruce on some motel
          stationery.  It's a TIMELINE, with TICKS for dates.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Alright, we're here...
                                (makes tick)
                        The end of the world is here.

          He makes another tick, a little ways down the timeline.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm not liking this so far.

          Johnny makes another tick right after his first one.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Very soon, something's going to
                        happen.  Wey's gonna get knocked
                        out, and fall into a coma.

                        up after...

                        Zone.

                        head... my cane head.

          They both look at the cane, resting against the desk.

                                        BRUCE

                        Well, you better get ready 'cause
                        this is just the start.  Think of
                        this; if I save Wey, if I prevent

                        or coming out of one, and he's
                        not going to have visions of me.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's a bad thing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce, this is the one person who
                        can tell us what starts Armageddon. 
                        What causes it.  He's the one
                        person who can help us stop it.

                                        BRUCE
                        So... you're not gonna help him? 
                        What about his Madeleine, and
                        Julia?

          Johnny, frustrated, picks up the cane next to him.

          WEY appears in the room, pacing, holding the cane head in
          his hand.  It's obvious that he's been waiting for it to
          "work."  Meaning he's been waiting for Johnny to pick up
          his end.  He assesses his surroundings, glares at Johnny.

                                        WEY
                        Where were you?

          Johnny stands.  Bruce cannot, of course, see Wey.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need to know exactly what happens
                        to your family.  And when.

                                        WEY
                        I can only see what you see.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It happens in your house.  I need
                        to get in there.

                                        WEY
                        Then take me with you.

          Johnny nods.



          Wey reacts, overcome with being inside his old house. 
          Johnny recognizes the doorway now from his visions.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is where you get hit.

                                        BRUCE
                        Me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, him.

          Johnny gestures to Wey, who is staring at the threshold. 
          Bruce nods in that general direction.

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh.  Hey.  By the way, name's
                        Bruce.  Nice... to meet...

          Bruce realizes what he's doing and stops himself.  Wey
          barely notices Bruce's attempt to address him.

          Johnny spots the wall where he saw Madeleine slumped dead
          in his vision.  He kneels beside it, touching and tapping,
          trying for a vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw her here...

          Wey's attention is focused on Johnny.  Johnny's not getting
            anything.  He moves along the living room wall, reaches
          the fireplace.  Feels the mantle, the glass cover, and as
          soon as he touches the FIRE POKER, we swing around...



          Suddenly a MAN wearing black duds and a black ski mask is
          taking the fire poker and walking over to the front door. 
          The PHONE is ringing.  The Man hides behind the front
          door, fire poker held down.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 06/24/03 - PINK      43.


    68CONTINUED:68

          We do a jump-cutty DEAD ZONE PUSH IN to him as time passes. 
          He reaches over and resets (re-arms) the security alarm.


  68A68ABACK TO SCENE

          Johnny looks toward the door.  Bruce follows his gaze.

                                        BRUCE
                        What do you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Someone.  Maybe a burglar.

          Johnny walks to the door.  Holding the fire poker in one
          hand, he concentrates as he feels around the door hinges. 
          SUDDENLY...



          The door opens, and Christopher walks in, disarms the
          security code.  He flips the key in his palm...

            Suddenly, the burglar steps from behind the door and
          STRIKES with the fire poker, bashing Christopher.  JOHNNY
          AND WEY are third person observers to this vision, and
          Wey is horrified as he watches Christopher hit the floor.

          The burglar brings down the iron rod AGAIN.  WEY flinches,
          watching himself get bludgeoned.  The burglar removes his
            ski-mask.

          LANCE FOSTER.  Johnny turns to Wey, who is bewildered. 

                                        WEY
                        Who is he?

          Foster stares down at Christopher, vindicated.

                                        FOSTER
                        How's that feel, you son of a
                        bitch?  Bet not as good as this.
                                (clubs him AGAIN)
                        You don't know what you had.  You
                        had something great.

          He drops the fire poker.  Bends down, and starts to drag
            Christopher's body into the house.

                                        FOSTER
                        But guys like you, got the whole
                        world eatin' out of your hand,
                        you never seem to care...

          Suddenly the front door opens, and outside on the porch
          stands JULIA.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 06/24/03 - PINK      44.

          She sees her Dad being dragged by another man, and her
          jaw drops.  WEY reacts, screaming out.

                                        WEY
                        Julia, RUN!

                                        FOSTER
                        Julia wait...

          Of course, Julia can't hear Wey, but she barely hears
          Foster.  She backpedals and TRIPS on the porch steps. 
          FALLS out of sight.

                                        WEY
                        No!

          Foster runs onto the porch.  Johnny follows him, knowing
          what he will see: Julia crumpled at the bottom of the
          porch steps, dead. 

                                        MADELEINE (O.S.)
                        Julia!

            MADELEINE runs up the walk, having seen her daughter fall. 

                                        FOSTER
                        She's okay.  She's okay.

          He scoops Julia up into his arms and tries to carry her
          back inside.  Madeleine panics, reaching for Julia.

                                        MADELEINE
                        What are you doing?  Get away
                        from her!  Get away!

                                        FOSTER
                        She's okay...

          He stumbles back into the house.  Madeleine stops clawing
          at him when she sees CHRISTOPHER on the floor.  Her hand
          flies to her mouth, stifling a shriek.  Frozen.

          Foster sets Julia down, and slams the door.  Desperate. 

                                        FOSTER
                        Maddy, it's okay...

                                        MADELEINE
                        No!

          She moves to her daughter.  Foster intercepts her, grabbing
          both of her arms.  She struggles.  He pushes her back,
          against the living room wall.

          Johnny watches, heart pounding but trying to keep calm.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 06/24/03 - PINK      45.


    68BCONTINUED: (2)68B

          Wey is panicked, reaching out, spectral hands passing
          through Lance Foster in vain.  Unable to protect his wife.

          Foster has a hand over her mouth, his other arm pressed
          against her chest, pinning her to the wall.

                                        FOSTER
                        Shhhh, it's okay.  It's okay.  I
                        didn't know you were here...

          She tries to scream.  He presses harder, her scream becomes
          muffled through his gloves.  Foster babbles, desperate.

                                        FOSTER
                        Madeleine.  Listen to me.  Listen
                        to me.  Stop.  I took care of
                        him.  I took care of that son of
                          a bitch, he's never going to hurt
                        you again.  Listen.  Listen.  We
                        can work this out, we can make
                        this work...

          She struggles, he presses against her even harder,
          restricting all movement.  Wey falls to his knees.

                                        FOSTER
                        Listen to me.  You deserve better. 
                        You deserve better than him.  You
                        just have to open your eyes. 
                                (she stops struggling)
                        Madeleine.  Do you hear me? 
                        Madeleine?  Maddy...

          He realizes he's pressing too hard, and slacks off.

          She sinks to the ground, heavy.  He follows her, realizes
          he's gone too far, has strangled her. 

          Her eyes are open, dull and lifeless.  Foster reaches out
          to touch one, and the lid closes.  He shrinks back, stares
          at the three bodies around him, then gets up and makes
          his way to the door.  He gives one more horrified look
          behind him, and then SLAMS THE DOOR, which --


  6969ENDS THE VISION

          with the door closed as it is now.  Johnny falters, dazed.

          Johnny leans forward on his cane, both hands on the grip.


          JOHNNY'S POV - WEY

          Sitting against the wall where Madeleine will die.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Someone she knows.

          Wey slowly looks up with bloodshot eyes.

                                        WEY
                        She was having an affair...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, you were.  And that man was
                        who she paid to prove it.

                                        WEY
                        How do you know that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        First you tell me what you know.

          Wey, miserable, shakes his head no.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We had a deal.  If we save her,
                        it won't matter.  Everyone is
                        going to die, and you know it.

                                        WEY
                        If you had the chance to go back
                        to June 5th, 1995, and stay with
                        Sarah Bracknell, and not have to
                        see what's coming... you'd know
                        why I don't care...

          He lets the cane head drop from his hand.

          Wey is GONE.  Suddenly, the sound of a key hitting the
          lock.  Bruce and Johnny turn to see the door open,
            revealing LT. SANDOWSKI and a UNIFORMED COP, both leveling
          police pistols.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI

          Bruce cradles a phone in his cuffed hands as the Uniformed
          Cop breathes down his neck.

                        Yeah, I'll hold...

          Move off him to find Johnny seated at Lt. Sandowski's
          desk, one hand cuffed to the steel chair he's in.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Well, that's an extremely detailed
                        statement, Mr. Smith.  Makes about
                        as much sense as your last one.

          The phone on his desk rings.  He picks it up.  Listens. 
          Then looks at Johnny while giving his answer.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Good.  Bring him over.

          His glance moves over Johnny's shoulder.  Johnny turns to
          see Christopher Wey being led over by another cop.  He
          doesn't look happy as Sandowski stands to shake his hand.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI

                        home to find a squad car parked
                        in my driveway, and the officer
                          searching my house tells me there's
                        been a break-in, and that my wife's
                        taken our daughter to her Mother's
                        house, who, when I called, said
                        she didn't want to talk to me.

          Johnny grunts in the key of "that doesn't surprise me."

          Christopher walks around to look Johnny in the eyes.

          His earnest inflection echoes Johnny's question to Wey. 
          Johnny holds his gaze, speaking deliberately.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm the guy who could've had the
                        life you take for granted.
                                (leans forward)
                        Difference between us is I lost
                        it all in one night, where you...
                        you're just pissing yours away.

          Christopher looks like he's about to hit Johnny, and
            Sandowski looks like he's about to let him.  Christopher
          opens his mouth, but Johnny cuts him off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Shut up.  Just shut up and listen,
                        for once.  Your wife's hired a
                        private investigator to prove
                        you're cheating on her.  He's...

                        Here we go again with the P.I.
                        His name is Lance Foster, he's
                        the one who reported the break-
                        in. 
                                (to Johnny)
                        I think we've heard about enough
                        out of you.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        This is true, about my wife...
                        hiring this guy?

                                (evasive)
                        That would be her business.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Whatever you do, do not go home
                          tonight.  Go to your family and
                        stay with them.  Understand?

          Chris turns to Sandowski.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        If you need me to testify, press

                          necessary...

                        Dammit, listen to me.

                          I warned you to stay away.

          Christopher walks off.  Johnny yells after him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't go home!

                        Keep your voice down.

          The CAPTAIN opens the door to his office.

                                        CAPTAIN
                        Sandowski, could I see you for a
                        second?

            Sandowski grudgingly heads over to the Captain's office,
          passing BRUCE, who is being sat down at another desk. 
          Bruce gives a confident nod to Johnny.



            Sandowski begins to remove Johnny's handcuffs, and walks
          him to the booking desk. 

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI

                        I'm sure in your argument to keep
                        me here, you left out the fact
                        that there was no breaking and

                        No forced entry doesn't mean you
                        were invited.  I'll encourage the
                        family to press whatever charges
                        they feel appropriate.  I'll even
                        suggest a few.

          Johnny turns to the other Cop, who has just released Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need my cane.

          The Cop leads him to the front desk, pulls out the cane
          and hands it to Johnny. 

          As he TAKES HOLD, our angle adjusts to see WEY, who takes
          in the police station, and then stares at Johnny, confused.

                                        WEY
                        Where is this?  What happened?

          Johnny closes his eyes.  Bruce sees he's disturbed.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's wrong?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing's changed. 



          On the kitchen counter PHONE as it begins to ring.  We
          hold on it, ringing, as no one answers.

          We then reveal FOSTER, dressed in black.  He ignores the
          phone, putting on his black ski mask.  It continues to
          ring as he heads to the fireplace, grabs the iron poker,
          and walks over to take his place behind the front door. 



          Bruce driving.  Johnny slams down his cell phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're already too late.  Go!

          Bruce downshifts and guns it.



          Christopher steps in.  Disarms the security panel.  Flips
          his keys in his palm.  Foster stirs behind him...


            CHRISTOPHER'S POV - THE FRONT HALL LEADING INTO HIS HOUSE.

          His last sight before BAM!  The screen goes WHITE.



          Foster has begun to drag Christopher's body when the front
          door opens, revealing Julia, who stops short, stunned. 

                                        FOSTER
                        Julia wait...

          Julia backpedals and TRIPS on the porch steps.  She FALLS
            backwards in slow motion...

          AND IS CAUGHT IN JOHNNY SMITH'S ARMS before she hits the
          stairs.  Foster runs to the door, looks down to see Johnny
          holding Julia, and Bruce jogging up the stairs toward
          him.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hi.

          Bruce DECKS Foster across the face.  He stumbles back in
          the house, trips over Christopher, and hits the floor on
          his back.  Bruce continues his forward motion, kneeling
          on Foster's chest and PUNCHING him again. 


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT FOUR - 06/24/03 - PINK       55.

          Johnny sets Julia down.  She runs into her Mother's arms. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Get her out of here!

                                        JULIA

                        Daddy's hurt...

            Madeleine looks into Johnny's eyes, and moves up the
          stairs, passing him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Madeleine, don't...

          She keeps going, setting Julia down at the threshold. 
          She is speechless as she sets eyes on Christopher. 

          Johnny walks up the porch steps, and moves through the
          door.  He looks to Bruce who moves out of the way to show
          Foster.  Out cold.

            Madeleine falls to Christopher, cradles him in her arms. 
          Julia crawls forward, shaking her Dad's arm, and then
          just holding on to it.  Madeleine looks up at Johnny.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Call 911.  Help... get help.

          Johnny looks at Bruce, who runs into the living room and
          picks up the phone.  Madeleine begins to cry. 

                                        MADELEINE
                        Help him...

          Johnny stands where he is, staring at Christopher,
            unconscious, in the arms of his Wife and Daughter.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

          Johnny sits, both hands on the cane top, waiting, slowly
          scanning his giant cork board.

          We PAN across it, settling on the latest addition: a
            newspaper clipping from the "Westchester Post."  Column
          titled "Local Man in Coma Following Assault."

          Underneath is a FAMILY PHOTO of the Weys: Christopher,
          Madeleine, and Julia in happier times.

          Johnny's expression shifts.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was wondering when you'd show.

          ANGLE ADJUST to reveal Wey, on the landing of the basement
          stairs.  He is dressed as always, hands in pockets.

                                        WEY
                        So was I.

          Johnny stands as Wey descends the stairs to stand face to
          face with Johnny.  A tense beat passes between them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I tried to stop...

          Wey cuts him off with a gesture.

                                        WEY
                        This is what's happened.  It's
                        what was meant to happen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know if that's true.

                                        WEY
                        And now we'll never know.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why are you here? 

                                        WEY
                        Why else?  I'm here to make you a
                        deal.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How did I know you were going to
                        say that?

          Wey begins to circle Johnny, studying him, like he's trying
          to figure something out, like Johnny is a puzzle to him.

                                        WEY
                        All I'm asking is that you look
                        after my family.  So I can know
                        they're safe.  And so I can look
                        in on them, until --

          Johnny cuts him off.  He's had enough.

                        I can help you stop it.

                        You keep promising that, but I

                        there.  You can't trust anyone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can trust me.

          Wey reaches into his coat, and pulls out a crumpled, singed
          paper of faded black and red.  He holds it out for Johnny
          to see.  His hand is shaking slightly.

                                        WEY
                        I'm not sure...

          CLOSE ON THE PAPER - THE COVER OF NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE

          Dated September 2010.  On the cover is a headshot of Johnny
          Smith, staring into the camera with intense eyes.  The
          headline is bold and clear:


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT FOUR - 06/23/03 - BLUE       58.

          "WILL THIS MAN DESTROY THE WORLD?"

          Johnny is unable to do anything but stare at the future
            artifact, experiencing a sinking feeling of doom.  

          Johnny blinks, and the magazine, and Wey, are GONE.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                              THE END
