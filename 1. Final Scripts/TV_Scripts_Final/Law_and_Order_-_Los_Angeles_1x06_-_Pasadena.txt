TEASER


INT. CASA ANTONIO RESTAURANT - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT11*

The dinner rush is on at this packed, upscale, of-the-
moment Latin restaurant.  REBECCA TOWNLEY (33, striking, 
magnetic, stylishly dressed) dances the intricate, high 
energy ballet that is her job as the hostess/manager.    

Rebecca greets a COUPLE at the hostess stand... She greets 
a BUSINESSMAN and CLIENT... She greets a REGULAR with a 
laugh at his joke and a touch on his arm....

She checks with this table and that... Pouring wine... 
Asking about the food... She directs the BUSBOYS and 
WAITERS here, there, and everywhere... She makes sure that 
chef/owner ANTONIO SANTIAGO (42, plump, Spanish accent, 
think Jos  Andr s) pays a visit to all his most valuable 
client le... No detail unattended.

Hands are shaken... Kisses exchanged... Flirty laughs 
offered... Hugs given... And then...

A moment: Rebecca alone.  She sighs.  Drained.  And we see 
how much energy it takes to keep all those plates spinning.


INT. CASA ANTONIO RESTAURANT - DOWNTOWN - LATER THAT NIGHT1A1A*

The bustling restaurant is now empty, except for Antonio 
and some of the kitchen and wait-staff.  They partake in 
the post-closing drinking ritual as Rebecca enters. 

ANTONIO
Rebecca -- Ven aqui.  Drink with us.

REBECCA
I can t.  So tired.  Lo siento, mucho.

The staff respond with friendly jeers.

REBECCA (cont'd)
Ma ana en la noche.  If we make it 
through dinner rush without breaking a 
plate, I ll bust out the good stuff.  

Someone LOBS a piece of bread at her, she ducks.

As the laughter continues, Rebecca exits --


EXT. CASA ANTONIO - ALLEY BEHIND - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT 22*

Rebecca moves quickly down the poorly lit, ominous alley.  
All local businesses are closed.

Suddenly -- A VEHICLE appears in the alley, its headlights 
BLARE.  Rebecca squints and shields her eyes.  The driver 
STOMPS the gas.  Rebecca never has a chance -- #01006/108                2            Rev. Green  10/01/10



EXT. CASA ANTONIO - ALLEY BEHIND - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT (TIMECUT) 33*

Thirty minutes later.  LAPD, LAFD, and EMTs fill the alley  
along with LOOKIE-LOOS and the STAFF from the restaurant. 
An ambulance speeds away from the scene, lights flashing 
and siren wailing.  WINTERS and TJ get briefed by SGT. 
COOPER (30s, female, drained). 

SGT. COOPER
EMT said she had multiple fractures, 
internal bleeding --

TJ indicates the large pool of blood where Rebecca lay --

TJ
Lot of external bleeding too.

SGT. COOPER
They re giving her 50-50 odds.*

WINTERS
We know where she came from?

SGT. COOPER
(indicates)
The restaurant.  They said she works 
there.  Name s Rebecca Townley.

Cooper indicates objects scattered on the ground --

SGT. COOPER (cont d)
We got a purse here, car keys there, 
cellphone smashed to bits --

TJ
How about a witness?

SGT. COOPER
Santa Claus.

She motions to a HOMELESS MAN (60s, African American) with 
a full white beard, round belly and Santa hat, sitting on 
the edge of the perimeter, watched over by a Uni.  

SGT. COOPER (cont d)
He says he saw it go down.

Winters gives TJ a  this is all you  look.  TJ crosses to 
the Homeless Man.

TJ

He rubs his index and thumb together.

TJ
Sorry, sir.  Can t do that.  I always 
figured Santa to be a good citizen.

HOMELESS MAN
(a beat, then --)
That car come at her like a bat outta 
hell.  It hit her.  Then it stop.  Then 
it back up over her again.

TJ
You see the driver or the license?

HOMELESS MAN
No.  But the car, it coulda been gray 
or black.  That s all.

TJ
Okay, thank you.
(aside, to Uni)
Take Santa down the street to Tommy s, 
get him a chili dog.  And don t let him 
out of your sight.

He hands the Uni a couple of bucks, then joins Winters 
who s looking through Rebecca s purse.

TJ (cont d)
The car took two runs at the girl.  
Makes it attempted murder.  

WINTERS
Homicide.

Off TJ, Winters shows him what he found in the purse -- a 
SONOGRAM PHOTO from Rebecca s purse.  The photo is taped to 
a card inscribed with Rebecca s name.

WINTERS (cont d)
Rebecca Townley was 16 weeks pregnant.

TJ reacts.  The cops consider the pooled blood.  Off 
Winters as he moves off --

ACT ONE


INT. CASA ANTONIO RESTAURANT - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT 44*

Winters and TJ interview Antonio who s reeling from the 
news.

ANTONIO
Rebecca s been with me for two years.  
My best manager, very upbeat person.  
Is she going to make it? 

WINTERS
We don t know.  Can you think of anyone 
who d want to hurt her? 

ANTONIO
No.  She and her husband split up last 
summer, but I think that was all cool.

TJ
How about a boyfriend?

ANTONIO
I don t think she was going with 
anyone.

TJ
But somehow she managed to get 
pregnant.

ANTONIO
She s pregnant?

WINTERS
She was.  About three months.

ANTONIO
Man, she didn t say anything.  We re 
practically like family here.

WINTERS
You notice any change in her habits, 
anything unusual?

ANTONIO
Yeah, last month she said she was 
quitting.  She was working in my Santa 
Monica restaurant.  I told her I can t 
afford to lose her.  She agreed to stay 
on for a little while but only if she 
could work here, downtown.

TJ

ANTONIO
No.  But now it makes sense -- pregnant 
ladies, they re all a little loco.

Off Winters and TJ --


INT. APARTMENT - WEST HOLLYWOOD - DAY55

KERN (28, gay, fit manager) escorts Winters and TJ in the 
front door.

KERN
Rebecca hasn t actually been inside her 
home for at least a month.

TJ
You keep tabs?

KERN
I notice.  The window in my kitchen 
faces her front door.  The lights 
haven t been on.  No music, no TV.  
Only time I ve seen her is twice, late 
at night, picking up her mail 
downstairs.  I figure she met some guy, 
was spending time at his place.

WINTERS
Looks like she took her clothes with 
her.

Winters has opened the closet in the bedroom -- it s mostly 
empty.  TJ is checking the fridge --

TJ
Yup, one month -- that s about the age 
of the mold on this loaf of bread.

WINTERS
Anyone been here looking for Rebecca?

TJ
Or maybe you noticed someone outside 
watching the building?

KERN
You mean, like a stalker?  That s 
interesting.  No, I haven t seen 
anybody like that.

TJ
Okay, thanks.

KERN
Sure.  Tell Rebecca, Kern s praying for 
her.  And you catch that guy.  
Rebecca s a nice girl.

He leaves.  Other than furniture and kitchen stuff, there s 
not much else in the place: no computer, no papers, etc.  
As the cops continue poking around -- 

WINTERS
Definitely looks like she was trying to 
shake someone.

TJ
I m going with the ex-husband.  Maybe 
things weren t so  cool  after all.


EXT. FORESTER S HOUSE - LARCHMONT - DAY66

Expansive homes on a tree-lined street.  ROBERT FORESTER 
(37, business attire) pays a cab and grabs his luggage as 
Winters and TJ approach.  (NOTE: in the driveway is a green 
SUV).  TJ badges Forester.

TJ
Robert Forester?

ROBERT
Yes?  

WINTERS 
You been away?

ROBERT
On business.  In Twenty-Nine Palms.  
What s this about?

WINTERS
Your ex-wife, Rebecca Townley, was in 
an accident.  

ROBERT
Is she alright?

WINTERS
She s in a coma.

ROBERT
My god.  Please.  Come inside.#01006/108                7            Rev. Green  10/01/10



INT. FORESTER'S HOUSE - LARCHMONT - DAY77

Robert enters with Winters and TJ, sets his suitcase down.

ROBERT
So what happened?

TJ
Hit and run in the alley behind her 
restaurant last night.  When s the last 
time you talked to her?

ROBERT
Maybe five months ago.  Some financial 
b.s. we had to sort out.

Winters sees a photo of Forester and a hottie on a beach.

WINTERS
New girlfriend?

ROBERT
Yes.  I ve moved on.

TJ
So the financial b.s. -- alimony?

ROBERT
There s no alimony.  We have good jobs, 
no kids.  There was a settlement.  A 
clean break.  Everyone behaved, under 
the circumstances.

WINTERS
What circumstances?

Robert shrugs, doesn t answer.

WINTERS (cont d)
You cheated?  Or her?

ROBERT
Her.

WINTERS
The same man who got her pregnant?

ROBERT
Pregnant?  I had no idea...Is she...?

WINTERS
Afraid not.  She lost it.  Any chance 
it was yours?

ROBERT
No.  She never told me who the other 
guy was.  Believe it or not, I didn t 
care to know.  I just wanted out.

TJ
If you had to take a guess?

ROBERT
Probably somebody she met at her 
restaurant, some a-hole with a big 
expense account.  Becky always had big 
aspirations.

The cops exchange a look.

TJ
Just for drill, Mr. Forester, we ll 
need documentation about your trip to 
Twenty-Nine Palms, boarding pass, hotel 
bills, that kind of thing.

ROBERT
Sure.  No problem.  I just need to call 
my girlfriend first.

The cops nod, Forester moves off.  TJ looks at Winters.

TJ
Bitter much?


INT. LAPD GARAGE - DAY88

A garage full of black and whites and seized vehicles. 
Winters is next to a Miata, writing an inventory of items 
as TJ enters with some documents --

TJ
Forester s alibi checks out -- hotel s 
got him in his room all night, surfing 
the net on his computer.  Moves us to 
suspect number two.

WINTERS

TJ

Winters motions to items laid out on the Miata s hood.*

WINTERS (cont d)
We got a car club card...Proof of 
insurance...

TJ
Unpaid parking ticket.  Reminds me, I 
think I got one of those.

WINTERS
Don t let it go to warrant, or I ll be 
knocking on your door...
(he finds)
A corporate gas card...Yarborough Media 
Strategies.  I don t remember seeing 
that Rebecca s ever worked there.  

TJ
Maybe her baby daddy does.


INT. YARBOROUGH MEDIA STRATEGIES - RECEPTION AREA - DAY99

Winters and TJ study a wall of framed political memorabilia 
-- buttons, ribbons, signage from the 40s through 60s, when 
ADAM YARBOROUGH (35, corporate, Ivy League) approaches.  

YARBOROUGH
I m Adam Yarborough.  I m told you were 
asking about Rebecca Townley.

TJ
Yes.  Does she work here?

YARBOROUGH
She s not one of our regular employees, 
no.  Why do you ask?

WINTERS
We found your company gas card in her 
car.

Winters holds up a photo of the gas card.  A subtle hitch 
in Yarborough s demeanor.

YARBOROUGH
Oh God...

The cops wait, then --

WINTERS
Aren t you going to ask about her baby?

Yarborough looks at them, then --

YARBOROUGH
I, I think I need to speak to an 
attorney.  Leave your card with the 
receptionist.  Thank you.

WINTERS
One more thing, Mr. Yarborough.  You 
wouldn t happen to know where Ms. 
Townley s been living the last month, 
would you?

Yarborough looks at them, flustered, then leaves.

TJ
Partner, you really have a way with 
people.


INT. RHD - BULLPEN - DAY  1010

TJ briefs GONZALES.  Winters examines Rebecca s financials.

TJ
Yarbourgh s company has offices here 
and in DC.  But his only residence of 
record is a house in Maryland he owns 
with his wife.

GONZALES
Yarborough s got to lay his head 
someplace when he s in LA.

He and Rebecca have probably been 
laying it in the same place.

What kind of car does he drive?

TJ
Leases a white Beemer.  Doesn t match 
the description or the tire tracks at 
the scene.

WINTERS
(finds something)
Rebecca charged two visits to an OB-GYN 
in Pasadena.  She has a place in West 
Hollywood, she works downtown but she 
goes all the way to Pasadena for an 
obstetrician --

GONZALES
Maybe because he s near Yarborough s 
shag palace.


INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - PASADENA - DAY  1111

Winters and TJ with DR. PETER WEINSTEIN (53, fit, salt and 
pepper hair) surrounded by photos of babies he delivered.  
Weinstein s expression is one of profound sadness as he 
looks at a photocopy of the sonogram the cops found in 
Rebecca s purse.

DR. WEINSTEIN
She d just found out she was having a 
boy.  She was over-the-moon about it. 

WINTERS
I bet.  I ve got three kids myself.  
Doctor, we need to get in touch with 
the baby s father.  We think Rebecca 
might ve been staying with him.

Weinstein brings up Rebecca s file on his computer as --

If you want us to arrest her for 
obstruction, we can do that.  Your

arrest and you can all come down to our

Adam had a...a brief affair with 
Rebecca.  She got pregnant...Adam and I

decided to raise the baby as our own.

WINTERS
That doesn t explain why she was living

CAROLYN*
I...I agreed to care for Rebecca until 
she had the baby.  Adam and I are 
deeply committed to making this work.

Winters takes a beat to size her up.

WINTERS
Must be tough, putting on a brave face.

CAROLYN*

events.  TJ skims, then, to Winters --

TJ
Mr. Yarborough is saying Rebecca was a 
surrogate mother for him and his wife, 
that she was impregnated by a fertility 
clinic.

WINTERS
That s your story?  Because your wife 
just told me you impregnated Rebecca 
when you had a fling with her.

ELLERBEE
Don t respond to that.

WINTERS
You went to a lot of trouble to hide 
the fact Rebecca was living with you.  
You ditched her clothes, her suitcase, 
her personal things, all you missed was

Our cops with LOUISE HAMMOND (64, spry, caftan over bathing 
suit) as she fishes leaves from the pool with a skimmer.  

LOUISE
My husband and I are supporting 
candidates for state assembly.  Adam s 
firm helped me with the fundraiser.

TJ
Till what time was he here?

LOUISE
About ten-thirty.  That s when my 
husband kicked everybody out.  He goes 
to bed early, he s training for an Iron 
Man.  He s seventy-one.

WINTERS
How well do you know Mr. Yarborough?

LOUISE
Well enough.  We ve relied on him for 
five or six years now, we raise money 
for charities, cultural events -- can 
you reach that grapefruit for me?

She hands the skimmer to TJ, motions to a grapefruit 
floating in the middle of the pool.  As TJ fishes for it.

LOUISE (cont d)
Worst idea my husband ever had, putting 
a fruit tree uphill from the pool.  
Darn things are constantly rolling in.  
Is Adam in trouble?

TJ
Probably not.  He ever mention the name 
Rebecca Townley?

LOUISE
No.  Oh I see...For what it s worth, 
I ve never seen Adam so much as look at 
another woman.

WINTERS
The night of your fundraiser, how was 
he -- worried, preoccupied? 

LOUISE
He s always preoccupied.  That s what 
makes him so good.

TJ has fished out the grapefruit, holds it in the skimmer s 
basket for Louise.

TJ
You remember if he left with anyone?

LOUISE
Congressman Nelson from Riverside.  
Chairman of Defense Appropriations?  It 
was Adam who convinced him to attend -- 
they go back to the 2000 campaign.
(re: grapefruit)
It s all yours.  My husband and I can t 
eat them.  Doctor s orders.


INT. NELSON'S CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE - RIVERSIDE - DAY1818

Mahogany desk, leather couches.  CONGRESSMAN THOMAS NELSON *
(49, perfect suit, perfect smile) enters with Winters and 
TJ.

NELSON
A hit-and-run?  Is Adam a suspect?
(off their silence)
Okay, after the fundraiser, Adam and I 
went for drinks on the Westside.*

TJ
Until what time?

NELSON
Until the bar closed.  I spent the 
night at a hotel because I had an early *
meeting in Century City.  How serious 
was this accident?

TJ
The victim s in a coma.  She was 
pregnant and lost her baby.

That s terrible.

Winters admires an election night photograph of Nelson, his 
wife, Yarborough and Carolyn.*

WINTERS
You and Mr. Yarborough are good 
friends?

NELSON
He started off as a staffer with me, 
ended up running two of my campaigns.

WINTERS
You know of any problems in his 
marriage?

NELSON
Not directly.  

The cops sense more to the story.

NELSON (cont'd)
When you campaign with someone, you 
hear things.

WINTERS
What kind of things?

NELSON
Gossip.  That Adam had a wandering eye.

TJ
The name Rebecca Townley ever come up?

NELSON
No.  That s the young woman who was 
injured?
(off their nods)
Look, whatever you hear about Adam, you 
should know that he s one of the most 
loyal, trustworthy men I ve ever worked 
with.

An assistant has appeared at the door, Nelson goes to deal 
with him.  TJ looks at Winters --

TJ
First he says Yarborough cheats on his 
wife, then he calls him loyal?

Winters swipes a PAMPHLET featuring Nelson s picture off a

INT. HOTEL BAR - WESTSIDE - DAY1919*

Winters shows the BARTENDER (30s, sun-kissed blonde) the 
PAMPHLET with Nelson s picture on it.  

BARTENDER
Yeah, I remember.  Four scotches.  Left 
me a hundred dollar gratuity.

TJ
Nice tip.

BARTENDER
He flirted.  I let him.  My husband and 
I are saving for a house.

TJ
Was the Congressman alone?

BARTENDER
There was another guy with him.

Winters shows Yarborough s DMV photo.  The bartender nods.

BARTENDER (cont'd)
Right.  Bourbon.

WINTERS
You remember what time this guy left?

BARTENDER
He only had the one bourbon, so it had 
to be early.

WINTERS
Can you possibly pull their tab?

BARTENDER
(nods)
Scotch charged the drinks to his room, 
so it should just take a sec.

She moves off to the register.

TJ
If Nelson is Yarborough s client, why 
didn t Yarborough pick up the check?

WINTERS
Maybe because Yarborough was long gone 
before closing time.


INT. RHD - INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - DAY2020

Winters and TJ have pulled Yarborough and his lawyer, 
Ellerbee, back in.  Gonzales and PRICE watch from the 
Gallery.

TJ
You expect us to believe you nursed 
that bourbon for two hours?

ELLERBEE
Why not?  Maybe he just wanted to keep 
the Congressman company.

YARBOROUGH
Didn t you talk to Congressman Nelson?  
Didn t he tell you I was with him?

TJ
He was hard to pin down.  I guess 
that s how he keeps getting re-elected.

Yarborough takes this in, then --

YARBOROUGH
I went straight home from the bar.  I *
didn t hurt Rebecca.  My wife and I 
wanted that baby.

WINTERS
Now see, we d be more likely to believe 
you if you and your wife were on the 
same page about this pregnancy.

TJ
You say it s a surrogate, she says not.

YARBOROUGH
Okay.  I had an affair with Rebecca.  I 
met her last summer, there was a fund-

The cops exchange a look.  Winters starts flipping through 
his notes as --

WINTERS
Must ve been a big shock to you when 
she told you she was pregnant.

YARBOROUGH
Yes, it was.

Winters has found what he was looking for in his notes.

WINTERS
The blood tests for genetic diseases, 
Dr. Weinstein in Pasadena did those?

YARBOROUGH
Yes.

WINTERS
Says here Rebecca s RH negative, so you 
must be RH negative too.  Is that what 
Dr. Weinstein told you?

YARBOROUGH
Yes, RH negative.

Winters leaves with TJ.


INT. RHD - OBSERVATION GALLERY - CONTINUOUS2121

Winters and TJ join Gonzales and Price.  Gonzales is 
checking her Blackberry. 

WINTERS
He s lying.  Weinstein never ran any 
tests on the father.

PRICE
One way to know for sure.  Book him for 
obstruction.  He ll get swabbed for 
DNA, we can get a paternity test.

TJ
Even if he s not the dad, it doesn t 
mean he didn t run Rebecca down.

GONZALES
You can always ask Rebecca Townley.
(re: Blackberry)
She just came out of her coma.


INT. HOSPITAL - ICU - DOWNTOWN - DAY2222

Cold, harsh.  Rebecca s face is swollen and bruised.  Both 
arms in slings, IVs and tubes attached.  Her mother THERESA 
TOWNLEY (50s, exhausted but upbeat) is glued to her side.  

THERESA
The doctor said her mind and her memory

Did you find my purse?

TJ
Yes, we found it.

REBECCA
There was a picture of my baby.  So

Winter looks at TJ -- She doesn t know she lost the baby.  
Rebecca notices the look.

REBECCA (cont d)

No... No...

Rebecca screams out.  Theresa RUSHES back inside.

THERESA

INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DOWNTOWN - DAY2323

Winters and TJ update MORALES and Price.  

TJ
They sedated her, we haven t been able 
to talk to her since.

MORALES
What were her words exactly?

WINTERS
(refers to notes)
 Tom did this.  Tom Nelson killed our *
baby.  That bastard killed our baby. *

PRICE
 Our baby  -- hers and Nelson s.

MORALES
Or hers and the pizza boy.  Where was 
Nelson when she was run over?

WINTERS
At a hotel bar in Westwood.

TJ
He s a congressman, he has the knack of 
having people do his scutt work for 
him.

MORALES
If he has a dog in this fight.  First 
step is proving he s the baby s father.  
We can t force him to be tested without 
corroboration.  So find some.

Morales departs.  Price s attention is drawn into the room

Theresa ruefully nods in agreement.

change her mind and move back to 
Delaware.

PRICE
Change her mind, from staying in Los 
Angeles?

THERESA
This is no place for a single mother.  
I told her she needed me.  But she said 
she didn t need my help, that she d be

PRICE
 Moving up in the world  -- Rebecca 
thought she hit the baby daddy jackpot.

WINTERS
A five-term congressman seems more like 
the grand prize than Yarborough.

TJ
Assuming Nelson s the dad, he got 
Yarborough to take the rap for knocking 
up his mistress.  Talk about loyalty.

Congressman Nelson of trying to kill 
her.

Price lets that sink in.

Now your husband s a good little 
soldier in the Congressman s army, but 
the time to stand-by-your-man is over.  
One more lie and you re going from 
obstruction to murder conspiracy.

And now she lets that sink.  Carolyn is making her mind up, *

CAROLYN*
Nothing.  Rebecca gave the impression

Happy to be with Rebecca.  And she was 
mostly happy to go along with his 
charade.

PRICE
 Mostly happy? 

CAROLYN*
Nelson had sent a car to take her to a 
doctor.  She refused to go --

I did work, I sent emails, I bought 
stuff.  It s all time stamped.

PRICE
But somehow your thumbprint and a man s 
shirt with Rebecca s blood was found at 
a gas station near 29 Palms.

TABOR
My client takes business trips to the 
Marine base twice a month.  When he *
drives, that station is a convenient *
stopping point.  As for the shirt, 
anyone could have planted it.  All this 
so-called evidence only highlights the 
big hole in the middle of your case: 
the murder weapon.  You don t have the 
car.  No car, no case.

MORALES
Wrong.

INT. RHD - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY3838

Winters, TJ, Price in a semi-circle around COMPUTER TECH *
STACEY MARIS who works on Robert Forester s laptop. *

MARIS*
I can tell you definitively that Mr. 
Forester s computer was hooked up to 
the wi-fi in the hotel on that night.  
I can also tell you that someone else 
accessed it from a remote location and 
was using it to surf the Net, write e-
mails and work on file documents.

WINTERS
Forester wasn t using the computer?

MARIS*
Mr. Forester didn t even have to be in 
the room.

TJ
Somebody just tried to make it look 
like he was.

MARIS*
Right, by creating all this activity on 
his computer.

PRICE
The person who accessed his computer, 
where were they?

MARIS*
They could ve done it from anywhere in 
the world.  I can backtrack their 
computer s IP address to a server at a 
specific location.


INT. NELSON'S CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE - RIVERSIDE - DAY3939

Nelson s attorney, Harrison, reads a warrant.  Winters and 
TJ check computers with the several Computer Techs.  
Morales, Price and several Riverside Sheriff s Deputies 
look on.  Harrison turns to a put-upon Nelson.

HARRISON 
They re looking for a computer from 
this office.  

PRICE
We have evidence it was used to create 
an alibi for Robert Forester.

NELSON
By someone in my office?  Ridiculous.  
You knock yourself out, Mr. Morales, 
open every drawer, every cabinet.  If 
you ll excuse me, I have my district s 
business to attend to.

He moves off with Harrison.  Winters and TJ approach.

WINTERS
We checked every machine.  Our 
computer s not here.

PRICE
(a nod to Nelson)
He probably got rid of it.

MORALES
(makes a decision)
Charge Nelson as Forester s co-
conspirator.  When the screws tighten, 
we ll see who flips.


INT. COURTROOM - DAY4040

Preliminary Hearing.  JUDGE SONIA HIRSH (from  Hollywood ) 
presides.  Nelson, Forester, attorneys Harrison and Tabor 
for the defense.  Nelson s wife is there.  Morales has 
already presented reports and cross-examined witnesses.

TABOR
We move to dismiss this case for 
insufficient evidence, your Honor.  Mr. 
Morales doesn t have the car or this 
phantom computer which could somehow 
magically negate my client s alibi.

HARRISON
Nor does he have one shred of evidence 
of any agreement or overt act that 
would implicate my client in a murder 
conspiracy.

MORALES
Your Honor, the evidence establishes 
that Mr. Forester s computer was 
operated remotely at the time he 
claimed to be in his hotel room.  And 
as your Honor knows, a murder weapon is 
not essential to prove guilt.  As to 
Congressman Nelson, the People can 
prove he was part of an ongoing 
conspiracy to disguise the fact he 
fathered a child out of wedlock, a 
conspiracy that included having another 
man claim paternity, included buying 
Mr. Forester s silence with a high-
paying job, included having the victim 
Rebecca Townley move out of her home 
and pressuring her to have an abortion.  
And finally a conspiracy that included 
using a computer in Congressman 
Nelson s congressional office to 
remotely operate Mr. Forester s 
computer to help him create an alibi 
while he was out murdering Rebecca s 
unborn child.  In the name of that 
child, that unfulfilled promise, the 
People ask that you let a jury hear 
this case.

He returns to his seat.  A moment as all that sinks in.  

JUDGE HIRSH
Well put, Mr. Morales.  The court 
hereby rules there s sufficient 
evidence to proceed to trial.  
Defendant Thomas Nelson will remain *
free on bond, defendant Robert Forester 
will be held on remand.  We are 
adjourned.

Forester takes the news as if he expected it.  Nelson takes 
it as a shock and bridles.  Harrison huddles in close and 
tries to calm him.  Morales and Price take note as they 
assemble their papers.

MORALES
Fifty bucks, Harrison wants a chat.

PRICE
Do I look like a sucker?

Sure enough, Harrison looks over at Morales.#01006/108                42            Rev. Green  10/01/10



INT. DA'S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY  4141

Morales and Price with Nelson and Harrison.  For the first 
time, Nelson is scared.

NELSON
If you say someone in my office used 
that computer, I believe you.  I can 
only imagine they thought they were 
doing me a favor.  But I swear, I had 
nothing to do with hurting Rebecca...

MORALES
You were ready to get her an abortion --

NELSON
In a moment of panic.  But I love 
Rebecca, she made me see I was making a 
mistake.  I wanted that baby, and I had 
plans to do the right thing --

Harrison gestures to silence him.  Morales and Price are 
left to wonder what Nelson meant --

MORALES
Are we supposed to take his word he had 
noble intentions?

HARRISON
He s been paying Ms. Townley s medical 
bills, he arranged to pay for her 
mother s stay here --

PRICE
Did he arrange for a gift basket too?

HARRISON
Fine.  Make fun of him.  But at the end 
of the day, you ll be on the business 
end of a lawsuit for defamation and 
wrongful prosecution.

He leads Nelson out of the office.

PRICE
Nelson s all about Nelson.

MORALES
Yes.  But I believe him about doing the 
right thing...

What s a narcissist s version of doing 
the  right thing?

INT. DA S OFFICE - MORALES  OFFICE - NIGHT4242

Morales, tie off/sleeves rolled up, and a barefoot Price, 
pour over Nelson's financials scattered around the floor.  

MORALES
I never thought I d say this about a 
politician, but Nelson s books seem on 
the up and up...

PRICE
What do you make of this?  Ten years 
ago, Nelson set up a family trust.  
Then last month, he paid a bill to the 
same lawyer who set up the trust.  No 
reason he d go back to that lawyer ten 
years later -- 

MORALES
Unless he was setting up a new trust 
for Rebecca and the baby.

PRICE
The lawyer won t tell us.

MORALES
But someone else might.


EXT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT COURTYARD - DAY4343

Morales and Price with Rebecca in a wheelchair.

REBECCA
Tom was adding me and the baby to his *

after the baby was born.

MORALES
You re sure it was his family trust?

REBECCA
Yes.  I signed papers at the lawyer s 
office.  Tom said our baby would never *

Rebecca sees a nurse approach.

REBECCA (cont d)
I have to go back in...
(beat, looks up)
Sometimes, I still feel the baby inside 
me...The nurse says it s normal.

Morales and Price watch as the nurse wheels Rebecca away.

MORALES
There s no way Nelson could ve legally 
added Rebecca to the family trust 
without his wife s permission.

PRICE
So either Rebecca lied to us, or Nelson 
lied to her.

Morales mulls it over a little longer, then --

PRICE (cont d)
If Nelson s wife wasn t going to be 
around -- I mean like really not around 
-- her consent to add Rebecca to the 
trust would be immaterial.

MORALES
Not around, as in dead?

PRICE
She had cancer four years ago.

I doubt a woman like you, who has faced 
down cancer, would stand still for what

up for his career, obliterate all that 
with this ready-made family the minute 
you succumb to your disease.

Winters and TJ, followed by a Palm Springs PD patrol car, 
drive up a residential street.

They pull up to a house.  The windows are shuttered, no car 
in the driveway.  The place looks deserted.  The cops get 
out of the car and walk up the driveway.

AT THE NELSON HOUSE --

MORALES
They keep a car there, don t they?  A 
1986 tan Cadillac Deville?  A car *
matching the description of the one 
that ran down Rebecca Townley. *

No response from an increasingly apprehensive Patricia.  
Price gets a text.

PRICE*
The police are outside the house now.*

The Patrol Officers and our cops are putting a jack in 
place to force open the garage door.

AT THE NELSON HOUSE --

MORALES
You have one chance, Mrs. Nelson.  *

I told Robert Forester that I d get him *
fired unless he helped me.  He refused
