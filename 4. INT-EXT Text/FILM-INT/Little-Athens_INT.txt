The room is dark and messy. JERRY, a soft, unshaven boy of about
eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t-
shirt. He has not quite woken up yet.
Jerry pulls a huge, well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and
tosses it onto the bed. He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING
from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase.
Jerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and
not much cleaner. Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and
jelly SANDWICH. He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can
of SODA. His lazy mind is somewhere else.
Jerry gargles with a generic brand of MOUTHWASH and spits into the
sink.
He catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he
is not very attractive. He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR, and
exits the bathroom.
The room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a
naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, an old
POGO STICK propped against the wall near the GARBAGE CAN at the foot
of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash. Jerry tosses his
Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE
and several VIDEO GAMES, on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III.
He has pitifully few belongings. He shuts the Suitcase.
The living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a
house full of bachelors. Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but
still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his
Suitcase through the foyer to the front door. He about-faces to
look at the interior of his home. He will not miss it.
He turns to open the screen door - it's stuck. He fiddles with
handle until the screen door opens. He exits, letting the screen
door slam shut behind him.
TITLE CARD:
Little Athens

The kitchen is empty except for HEATHER and ALLISON, both about
nineteen and dressed in EMS uniforms with "EMS" stitched
conspicuously on the back, seated on opposite sides of a wooden
table. Heather is dark-haired, about 5'9" and built like a lingerie
model. Allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than
Heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than
Heather. Heather has take-out PANCAKES and SAUSAGES in front of
her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine.
Allison has a BAGEL and a PEACH, which remain hardly touched - she
has a lot on her mind.
HEATHER
Yeah, asshole Jerry. He's moving to
Middletown. He left this morning.
ALLISON
No way.
How do you know?
HEATHER
Carter said. He got some job at some
company, giving his uncle hand-jobs.
Having put away the last of her food, Heather lights a CIGARETTE and
stands near the open window, careful to blow the smoke out the
window.
ALLISON
Doesn't sound so bad.
HEATHER
I got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow.
ALLISON
I don't want to go to a baseball game.
You're going with Derek anyway.
HEATHER
Ally, I don't want to go either, but Derek
told Adam he'd go, and I'm not going by
myself.
3
ALLISON
I thought Adam was hurt.
HEATHER
I wish.
Heather takes a drag of her Cigarette and exhales out the window.
JESSICA, about eighteen, wire-thin and plain, yet attractive in an
unkept sort of way, with dirty-blond hair past her shoulders, lies
on a couch sleeping. Her chokingly small living room is in a
7
devastating state of disarray, with clothes and empty food
containers flung in every direction.
An ALARM on a table next to the couch begins blaring, and Jessica
stretches out her arm to silence it.
Jessica is standing in front of the mirror staring at herself, still
half asleep. The bathroom is tiny like the living room - pathetic
rather than endearing. She puts TOOTHPASTE on her TOOTHBRUSH.
JINA, Jessica's mother, opens the front door and enters the living
room wearing a grocery checkout clerk's uniform. Jina drops her
old, worn out purse onto the coffee table and enters the hallway.
She opens the bathroom door and enters.
Jessica is brushing her teeth when Jina enters.
JINA
Aren't you supposed to be watching Katie
right now?
Jina reaches around Jessica and opens the medicine cabinet, grabs a
bottle of ASPIRIN, and shuts it. Jessica continues brushing as if
her mother were not there.
JINA (CONT'D)
Did you get my message?
Jessica shakes her head in the negative sense. Jina exits the
bathroom and Jessica follows, still brushing her teeth.
Jessica walks over to the ANSWERING MACHINE and hits a button. The
Answering Machine clicks on as Jessica brushes unenthusiastically.
ANSWERING MACHINE
(electronic voice)
You have one new message.
(Jina's voice)
Hi Jess, it's your mother, calling to say
happy birthday, since you'll be gone when
I get home. I'm driving your sister to
school and I'm leaving the car for her, so
I'll be taking the train back.
Jessica starts up as if she'd been struck. She spins around to an
open window near the couch, leans out, and spits out the toothpaste
8
to the concrete sidewalk below. Her mother's voice continues to
pour forth from the Answering Machine.
ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)
By the way, you should call your sister
and stop this not-talking nonsense.
Jessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back
towards the Answering Machine.
ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)
Anyway, I know how you hate long messages,
so I'll see you tomorrow...
Suddenly wide awake, Jessica turns to her mother.
JESSICA
That's fucking bullshit.
JINA
Here we go again.
JESSICA
What about my car?!
JINA
Jessica, your sister got into beauty
school, and she's going. Now I've got
about two hours sleep before I have to
drive her all the way the hell up there.
JESSICA
Yeah, I heard that.
JINA
Jess, you're still living here for free.
JESSICA
On the couch!
JINA
Jessica, it's still my car, and she needs
it. Can't you be happy for your sister?
JESSICA
Oh yeah, I'm real happy. She gets my car,
and I get shit. Thanks, Jina. Do me a
favor and tell her how fucking happy I am
for her.
JINA
If you're going to be like this, I'm just
going to bed.
9
Jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with
water.
Jessica returns to the living room wearing a t-shirt that reads
"Athens Youth Group" in large letters along the front. Jina is
gone. Jessica runs her hand through her hair, tossing it
haphazardly. She grabs a pair of large SUNGLASSES off of the coffee
table and places them over her eyes.
She opens the door and exits the apartment.
Jimmy now dressed in worn-out heavily-frayed khaki shorts and a
short-sleeve button down shirt with a "Ron's Gym" emblem on the
pocket, stands before his locker twisting the combination lock with
one hand while rotating steel CHINESE STRESS BALLS with his other
hand. He opens the locker and pulls out a large brown LUNCH BAG
propped prominently at the base.
RON (O.S.)
Hey Jimmy.
You fix the lat machine?
RON, the tall, well-built, forty-something owner of the gym,
approaches. Jimmy turns toward Ron. The row of lockers serves as a
backdrop.
JIMMY
Yeah.
RON
Jimmy, I'm just gonna say this, alright?
I gotta let you go. I can't afford two
employees.
JIMMY
So you're keeping Melinda?
RON
Yeah.
JIMMY
Ron, that is totally fucked!
I been here
way longer than her!
RON
Yeah, but I'm running a business.
There're guys who pay me dues just 'cause
she works here.
10
JIMMY
But she doesn't do anything! She just
sits at the front desk all day.
RON
I know that.
JIMMY
Tell her to fix the fucking lat machine,
she'll look at you cross-eyed.
RON
I can't afford two employees, and she
attracts business. That's it.
JIMMY
Fucking great. Thanks.
RON
Jimmy, don't take it personal. If you
were built like her I'd keep you.
Ron exits and Jimmy sits on the bench in front of his locker,
defeated. BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, a.k.a. Bobby the Bookie, an
enormous juicehead built like an old-school NFL linebacker, naked
except for a towel around his neck, having just taken a shower, is
leaning against the end of a row of lockers, waiting for his chance
at Jimmy. Jimmy would rather that Ron stay.
RON (CONT'D)
Bales.
Bobby nods in response as Ron passes by on his way out. With the
locker room empty, Bobby unconsciously changes demeanor. He's
tender, frighteningly tender, it's so entirely genuine. Jimmy would
prefer a beating - simple and final. Jimmy pulls his BACKPACK out
of his locker and begins clearing his STUFF.
BOBBY
So where you been?
JIMMY
What are you talkin' about?
Nowhere.
I
been working.
BOBBY
So you just don't return my phone calls.
JIMMY
Look, they lost, I owe you some more, so
what? I'll pay you. I want to put it on
Indy tonight.
11
BOBBY
I can't take any more of your bets.
I
look like a spineless fucking fag.
Bobby shuts Jimmy's locker and steps up to Jimmy so that Jimmy is
now face to face with Bobby's enormous organ - a terrifying sight
for mortal men and reputable women. Jimmy is struck silent,
savagely clenching his Chinese Stress Balls as he struggles for
thought.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
What the hell am I supposed to do with you
Jimmy? People are talkin'.
JIMMY
I know they're talkin'!
BOBBY
You don't know a fuckin' thing. Come by
my apartment tonight, we'll figure this
out.
JIMMY
I ain't like that.
BOBBY
Ain't like what?
JIMMY
Nothin'.
BOBBY
You don't know what I know.
You'll see.
JIMMY
I'm working tonight.
BOBBY
Jimmy, I ain't about beggin'. I'm lookin'
like a fool all on account 'a you. You
owe me. You owe me. I'm gettin' sick of
it.
Bobby moves on to his own locker.
HEATHER is driving the AMBULANCE, sirens blaring, a CIGARETTE
hanging out of her mouth, with ALLISON riding shotgun. HARRY, mild-
mannered, rotund, middle-aged and slightly balding, is in the back
sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance,
adjacent to a stretcher. Harry sits expressionless, adjusting his
spectacles as the ambulance shakes mildly from the driving.
ALLISON
(pointing)
Turn left at the light.
Allison and Harry are in the back with the Victim, and Heather is
again behind the wheel, moving her head ever so slightly, as if to
music playing in her head. Heather's moderate driving speed is in
sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene.
At the same red light that Heather recklessly ran earlier, Heather
17
stops and looks in all directions before proceeding, even though
there are no cars at the intersection.
HARRY
Uh, Heather, you want to step on it?
HEATHER
We'll get there.
ALLISON
You don't even know for sure if she slept
with Steve!
Heather turns around in the driver seat, taking her eyes off the
road.
HEATHER
Listen, fuck that slut, okay?! She can
fucking rot in hell! I'm not rushing for
her slut ass!
ALLISON
(pleading)
Heather, c'mon, she's out cold!
We gotta
hurry!
HEATHER
I-don't-fucking-care!! That slut can kiss
my ass!
(to Victim)
You hear me, you fucking bitch?!
As Heather spins forward to look at the road, the Ambulance jumps as
it hits a pothole.
Jimmy walks past a few tables where patrons are eating. PIZZA POP,
a sixty-ish pot-bellied man standing behind the counter making a
PIZZA, sees him.
PIZZA POP
(heavy Italian accent)
Hey-a, Jimmy, you don't hafta be here
'till 2:00! What's up, eh? You hungry?
JIMMY
Nah. I'm gonna start early, if that's
alright. I could use the cash.
PIZZA POP
Still paying offa those credit cards, eh
Jimmy? I told you them things are-a
trouble.
(calling into the back)
Sweetheart! Don't a worry about that!
Jimmy's a here and he's a gonna take care
of it!
In an arched entranceway to the back room we see PIZZA MOM back into
view holding several PIZZA BOXES in insulated CARRYING BAGS.
PIZZA MOM
(smiling)
Hey-a Jimmy!
Jessica is driving the old run-down yellow CAR we saw earlier in the
parking lot of the park, the window down and the radio blasting.
Her CELL PHONE rings and she picks it up.
JESSICA
Hello?
CARLOS (O.S.)
Where the hell are you?
19
JESSICA
Carlos?
Carlos has a look of disgust on his face.
JESSICA
I would have brought the car back, but I
need it.
CARLOS
So you ask.
JESSICA
I said I'm sorry.
CARLOS
Yeah right. And why the hell are you
still driving?
JESSICA
Fine.
The Car stops, Carlos and Jessica climb out of the Car and pass in
back of it without a word. Carlos climbs into the driver seat, and
Jessica the passenger seat. Jessica grabs Carlos's Nachos and
starts munching them down, dipping each one into the CHEESE SAUCE
that is on the side.
CARLOS
Where's the squirt?
JESSICA
At my place watching TV.
21
CARLOS
You left her alone?
JESSICA
Just for a minute. I left my novel at
Aaron's.
CARLOS
You need it now? Aren't you supposed to
be watching her?
JESSICA
Yeah, I'm stuck with her all weekend. I'm
just gonna get through these last few
weeks like I promised, and I'm done, I did
a good thing, and some other moron can
take a turn being her big sister.
CARLOS
Don't know why you wanted another sister
when you hate the one you got.
Jessica needs to change the subject.
JESSICA
What're you up to?
CARLOS
Guess who stopped by.
JESSICA
Who?
CARLOS
Guess.
JESSICA
Mary Lynn.
CARLOS
Yes.
Gigantic beast of a woman that she
is.
Jessica is obviously delighting in this. She enjoys Carlos fighting
off the affections of this very unattractive girl.
JESSICA
Aw Carlos, I think you should give her a
shot. She's probably one of those
personality girls.
CARLOS
Yeah, what you know about personality?
22
JESSICA
I bet she'll give it up right away.
CARLOS
Now that's something you know about.
JESSICA
You should go for it.
Drain them pipes.
CARLOS
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
Carlos reaches down and blasts the radio as the Car speeds down the
road.
OTS on Derek as he turns the page and continues reading the sports
section. A young preppy high school PUNK speeds by in a CORVETTE -
the RADAR GUN reads 93 m.p.h. As he passes, the punk looks straight
at Derek, mouth open, clearly surprised by Derek's presence. Derek
picks up his head and returns the stare of the surprised Punk as he
passes.
23
DEREK
Whoa.
(returning to the Sports
Section)
Slow down, there, buddy.
Derek's CELL PHONE rings.
He reaches down, fumbles around, and
brings it to his ear.
DEREK (CONT'D)
Yeah?
Jessica walks in.
Pitt let's the door slam shut.
JESSICA
Shit.
I left my novel here.
PITT
You got no idea why he's lookin' for you,
do you?
JESSICA
What're you talkin' about?
PITT
You been fuckin' around.
JESSICA
No I haven't.
PITT
Well, someone did somethin', cause Aaron
caught somethin' an' he ain't happy about
it.
JESSICA
He caught somethin'?
What the hell did he
catch?
PITT
Wouldn't say. Just said that he ain't
been with anyone, so it musta been you.
JESSICA
Shit.
PITT
You humped someone, didn't you?
JESSICA
I didn't do shit.
PITT
Well it musta been the immaculate
infection, 'cuz he got somethin'.
He's
lookin' fer you.
26
Jessica throws the Nachos on the coffee table and sits on the couch,
head in her hands, on the verge of tears.
JESSICA
Shit, shit...
PITT
Yeah, you did it.
JESSICA
Fuck you, Pitt.
COREY is MOPPING the floor. He glances up as Pedro steps over to
him. Corey and Pedro talk and argue like two kids on a playground.
PEDRO
Hey, mehn.
COREY
What're you doing back?
PEDRO
I got your sister.
(forming breasts with his
hands)
She got big.
COREY
That's my little sister.
PEDRO
She's hot, mehn. Esta buenisima.
COREY
Just take her back to our place!
PEDRO
I can't because we got no place.
We got
thrown out.
COREY
He threw us out?!
PEDRO
Si! And all our shit's still in there!
And Pancho, too!
COREY
That's illegal, isn't it?!
He can't just
lock us out!
27
PEDRO
Si, he sucks cock. I mean, I gotta go
find a job, I smell like shit, I'm fucked!
COREY
Maybe you should talk to your boss.
Like,
ask him to take you back.
PEDRO
No, fuck him, mehn! Just gimme Mr.
Cocksucker's address.
COREY
What for?
PEDRO
I take care of this.
COREY
Don't do anything that'll get us into
trouble.
PEDRO
Do you think I'm stupid, mehn? Don't
worry about this. I talk to him. But
first I take care of business.
Pedro bangs on a stall door, with no response.
Pedro pushes the
door to the stall open.
PEDRO (CONT'D)
Okay, mehn.
Good. Voy a cagar.
Pedro disappears behind the door of the stall.
Corey leans his Mop
against the wall and exits.
WIDE on Jimmy holding the Cat behind a set of sliding glass doors,
one door partially open. He enters and shuts the door behind him.
Music is playing through stereo speakers, and a black-and-white
movie is playing on the TV with the sound shut off. CAR, an Asian-
American late-twenty-something, is sitting back on the couch facing
28
the TV. Magazines, junk food, remote controls and a CORDLESS PHONE
are spread out on the coffee table. If Car notices Jimmy enter the
room, he shows no sign of it.
JIMMY
Saw your cat outside.
Jimmy tosses the Cat on the floor, and it scurries off to another
part of the house. Jimmy sits in a recliner beside the couch, glad
to take a load off. Jimmy takes a peak at the TV.
JIMMY (CONT'D)
I gotta get back to work. I got more pies
in the car.
No response. The Cordless Phone starts ringing.
Car remains
perfectly still.
JIMMY (CONT'D)
Car?
No response.
The Cordless Phone continues to ring.
Jimmy leans over from his chair and waves a hand in front of Car.
Nothing. Jimmy jumps up from his recliner. He stares at Car. He
steps over, takes two fingers and checks Car's pulse. He stands
back, unsure of what to do.
Hesitant, Jimmy walks over to a closet, opens the door, and slides a
GYM BAG out into the room. He opens the Gym Bag and pulls out a
large bag of MARIJUANA and a few jars of K. He throws them into his
Backpack, zips up the Gym Bag, and puts it back into the closet.
Jimmy exits through the sliding glass doors.
WIDE on Jimmy through the doors as he about faces and stares into
the house. He slides the doors open and re-enters.
He picks up the Gym Bag and carries it to the front of the couch.
He sets down Gym Bag and drops to his knees, all while noticing that
Car appears to be staring at him. He unloads the remaining contents
of the Gym Bag into his Backpack, including a few bags of PILLS, a
few more jars of K, and two large bags of WHITE POWDER.
He throws one strap of his Backpack over his shoulder and stands in
front of Car. Jimmy stares at Car.
29
Jimmy is driving through semi-busy traffic. Music is blaring from
the radio, and the driver-side window is open, making the noise in
the cockpit quite loud. Jimmy's left hand is simultaneously wrapped
around the steering wheel and the DELIVERY LIST, which is hanging
down over the steering wheel so that he can read it. Jimmy's CELL
PHONE rings.
JIMMY
(over the wind and music)
Yeah, it's Jimmy!
MATT (O.S.)
(barely audible)
Hey Jimmy, it's Matt. I need some K.
Jimmy turns off the radio and begins rolling up the driver-side
window.
JIMMY
Matt?!
Speak up, man, I can barely hear
you!
MATT, in his late teens, has a very short buzz-cut. He's wearing an
old t-shirt and faded cargo-shorts, and he's sitting up on the edge
of his unmade bed. Matt's bedroom is a shithole, with dirty clothes
piled everywhere. He's talking into a CORDLESS PHONE, using his
free hand to rub the back of his neck nervously.
MATT
(semi-whispering)
I need some K, dude. I need it for
tonight.
We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt.
JIMMY
(still rolling up the
window)
What?!
MATT
(semi-whispering)
Jesus Christ, Jimmy! My folks are home!
I need some K, dude!
30
JIMMY
Alright, alright! I got it, man,
got
plenty! I'll see you tonight!
Jimmy hangs up and begins to roll down the window. The cell phone
begins ringing again. Jimmy reverses himself and begins rolling the
window back up.
JIMMY (CONT'D)
Yeah, it's Jimmy!
We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt. Matt is now pacing
back and forth in his shithole room. His voice is hushed, although
the sense of urgency in it is obvious. Jimmy's still talking loud,
as his Piece-of-Shit does not provide a quiet ride.
MATT
Jimmy! Jesus, man! Listen to me! I need
one a' your special deliveries - I won't
be around tonight!
JIMMY
Alright, man, when do you need it?!
MATT
Like, now, dude! For tonight!
I'm taking
off!
JIMMY
Matt, you're way out of the way, man!
Wait for another delivery.
MATT
Look, I need it now, man!
Now now now!
I'm takin' off!
JIMMY
What's the rush?!
MATT
(finally confiding)
Look, dude, I'm takin' out this girl - a
friend of Setzer's. He said I could bang
her easy if I had some K.
JIMMY
Really?!
MATT
Easy, dude, easy.
Setzer's words - it's
in the bag.
Jimmy's eyes get very wide.
31
JIMMY
Jesus!
Jimmy slams on the breaks and cuts the wheel to the left. Too late.
Jimmy rocks forward as the stress balls that were sitting on the
passenger seat fly to the floor.
Jimmy's Piece-of-Shit has just rear-ended another CAR of equal value
parked in front of a STOP SIGN in an otherwise empty intersection.
The DRIVER of the forward Car stirs.
Jimmy has his right arm draped over the Pizza Boxes in the passenger
seat, protecting them from flying forward as a parent would have
instinctively reached to hold back a child. His Cell Phone starts
ringing again. He slowly begins to stir.
The driver, DAVE, a large, ripped, soft-spoken juicehead, gets out
of the forward car holding the back of his neck. He slams the door
shut with his free hand, pissed, and staggers towards Jimmy's car.
A twenty-something FEMALE PASSENGER is sitting motionless in the
passenger seat. Dave glances up and sees Jimmy.
DAVE
Jimmy?
(still dazed, but
immediately friendly)
Hey, what's up, man?
Jimmy turns off the ringer on his Cell Phone and gets out of his
vehicle.
JIMMY
Shit, Dave, sorry 'bout that. I was
talkin' on the phone. I didn't see the
stop sign, I guess.
DAVE
Don't sweat it.
(regarding his Car)
I could give a shit about this thing. I
was hopin' some rich doctor or lawyer or
somethin' hit me.
Jimmy notices the Female Passenger in the passenger seat and walks
toward her, with Dave following.
JIMMY
Holy shit, man, is she alright?
32
Jimmy and Dave both stand near the passenger side of the car. The
window is completely open. The Female Passenger lies motionless,
bleeding noticeably from the forehead.
DAVE
She'll be alright. You didn't hit us that
hard - it's gotta look worse than it is.
JIMMY
What're you, a fuckin' doctor?
We need ta
get her to a hospital.
DAVE
Fuck that, you'll have all kinds 'a
problems if we do that. Cops, insurance
and whatnot. You probably got drugs on
you...
JIMMY
Dave, look at her fuckin' head!
She's
bleedin' all over the place!
DAVE
Just give her a minute, she'll snap out of
it. She's a stripper, for god-sake.
JIMMY
That's retarded.
The Female Passenger begins to slowly stir.
It is clear she is out
of it - still very woozy.
DAVE
See?
I told ya.
JIMMY
Dave, you're a sick fuck.
I'm calling
911. Look at the blood!
Jimmy reaches for his Cell Phone, but Dave again objects.
DAVE
Put that shit away. I'll take her home
and give her some K, she'll be fine.
JIMMY
She needs a doctor.
What the hell's K
gonna do?
DAVE
Jimmy, listen, she's gonna be fine. A guy
like you should be avoidin' that kinda'
attention.
33
JIMMY
You should take better care of your girl.
DAVE
Bro, she ain't my girl. She plows through
all my drugs, and I fuck her like a goddam
whore. She's a whore.
FEMALE PASSENGER (O.S.)
Fuck you, Dave, you asshole!
DAVE
See, she's fine.
Dave lights a CIGARETTE.
JIMMY
Holy shit. You're fucked up.
(seeing an opportunity)
Hey, you need any juice or anythin'?
DAVE
No, man, I'm good.
JIMMY
You sure? Look, man, I just got a buncha'
stuff. Coke, e, K. I gotta sell it fast,
you can sell it to your crackhead friends
whenever.
DAVE
You been placin' bets with Bobby the
Bookie again?
JIMMY
No. I'm just, I'm payin', like, twenty
percent on my cards and shit, and it
drives me fuckin' nuts, pissin' all my
money away.
DAVE
Sellin' drugs ta pay off the plastic, huh?
JIMMY
You want it?
DAVE
Look, I'm definitely interested in a
little bit for myself, definitely, but I
ain't no dealer like you. Lemme think
about it.
JIMMY
Hey, your nose is bleedin'.
34
Dave reflexively puts a finger to his nostril and examines it for
blood.
DAVE
Seriously?
JIMMY
No, just horsin' around.
DAVE
Listen, I gotta get going.
Patch her head
up and shit.
JIMMY
Yeah.
(regarding Dave's Car)
Sorry, man.
DAVE
Don't even sweat it, man, I told ya.
Jimmy and Dave get in their respective cars and drive off.
The engine is off. HEATHER is behind the wheel and ALLISON is
slouched back on the passenger seat, both watching the two Male
Police Officers standing in front of the building.
ALLISON
I hate this job.
HEATHER
I should pick up one of them assholes.
ALLISON
Don't you have an appointment with Dr.
Cook?
HEATHER
Five-thirty, and I'm not missing it.
ALLISON
Derek probably thinks you're sleeping with
your doctor. There's nothing wrong with
you.
HEATHER
(holding the lower
portion of her right
ribcage)
Ally, I have a pain right here that has
nothing to do with my head. My dad died
of heart disease, and if that asshole
taught me anything, it's better to be
paranoid than dead.
39
A FEMALE POLICE OFFICER, a prim-and-proper plain-jane 5'5" woman in
her early twenties, exits the building and walks over to talk with
the two Male Police Officers.
HEATHER (CONT'D)
That's her.
Tess.
ALLISON
You're just guessing.
HEATHER
Ally, I know that's her.
That's his type,
too. That little slut.
Both Heather's and Allison's BEEPERS go off.
They both look down at
their Beepers and sit up in their seats.
ALLISON
Harry's waiting.
HEATHER
Sorry if I snapped.
ALLISON
You didn't snap.
HEATHER
I mean this morning.
ALLISON
Oh.
That's okay.
Heather starts the Ambulance and starts to pull out of the lot.
HEATHER
I'm just afraid its gonna be the whole
thing all over again with Derek, and then
I've got to find some other asshole, and
do it all again. I'm sick of the whole
cycle.
ALLISON
So do something different.
HEATHER
I'm trying, but he's fucking it all up.
As they pull out of the lot, the two Male Police Officers head
toward their Police Cars and the Female Police Officer heads back
inside the station.
JESSICA is on a PHONE, holding a bookmarked trash NOVEL in her hand.
PITT is sitting on the couch watching TV.
40
JESSICA
Yeah, where are you?
CARLOS' VOICE
Right down the street, gettin' some more
nachos.
JESSICA
Can you just come back and get me?
Hurry
up.
Jessica looks up to see TROY entering the house with AARON behind
him. TROY is a shaggy, 5'10" pothead slacker in his late teens,
wearing beat-up jeans, a t-shirt with a faded logo on it, and light
hair above his lip and on his chin. AARON, a burly mutt, about the
same age and only slightly shorter, wearing cut-off cargo pants with
one of the thigh pockets ripped off, a sleeveless shirt and a tattoo
on his left shoulder. Troy notices Jessica immediately.
TROY
Holy shit.
JESSICA
Aaron, I don't know how the hell you
got...
AARON
(interrupting)
Fucking bitch!
Aaron shoves Troy roughly out of the way as Jessica bolts out of the
room.
PITT
(to Jessica)
Use the back door, yo!
Jessica runs out the back door and around the front of the house.
Aaron sees her turn the corner of the house, and he turns around to
cut her off.
AARON
(to Pitt)
Man, don't be helpin' that bitch!
PITT
I don't want to see you be hittin' no
girl. Just calm your ass down.
AARON
Fuck you!
Aaron runs out the front door after Jessica.
41
TROY
He's gonna kill her.
Jessica is still reeling from the pepper spray.
She can barely
stammer out her words.
JESSICA
Oh my God, my fucking eyes!
CARLOS
Jesus, look at my car, Jess!
JESSICA
That fucking... asshole!
CARLOS
Now I'm screwed too.
Carlos turns to look through the rear window of his car - all clear.
JESSICA
(practically sobbing)
I'm so sorry.
An otherwise believable apology, except that Carlos knows Jessica
too well. Jessica does not want to be in this alone. Carlos cuts
the wheel to the right and tears down a side street.
HEATHER and ALLISON are changing back into their civies and putting
away their EMS gear into their lockers.
HEATHER
Are you comin' with me to register
tomorrow?
ALLISON
I dunno.
HEATHER
Why not?
ALLISON
My brother spent six thousand on tech
courses and he's still painting houses.
HEATHER
(looking at her watch)
I'm gonna be late.
ALLISON
Why don't you just reschedule?
HEATHER
You know how booked he always is. I don't
wanna be referred to that quack Hengis. I
don't trust women doctors.
ALLISON
Dr. Hengis is fine. You're the quack.
49
HEATHER
Ally, I'm really feeling something. A
deep ache, like someone's crushing me.
This can't wait.
ALLISON
You still feel like going out?
HEATHER
Hell yes.
Heather shuts her locker.
Jimmy's CELL PHONE rings.
He answers.
JIMMY
Yeah, its Jimmy.
PIZZA POP'S VOICE
Hey-a Jimmy! Where are you?! We got two
calls from 45 Smith Street wondering where
their food is!
JIMMY
(over the wind noise)
I got into an accident!
PIZZA POP'S VOICE
An accident?! Are you okay, Jimmy?!
JIMMY
I'm fine!
My car's banged up, but I'm on
my way!
PIZZA POP'S VOICE
Okay!
Drive careful!
JIMMY
Yeah!
Jimmy hits a button to hang up and shuts the Cell Phone, but the
cell phone immediately rings again. Jimmy flips the cell phone open
again. His eyes grow wide as he stares at the caller ID, which
reads "CAR LEE." Jimmy stares at the Cell Phone as it continues
ringing and ringing.
50
He hits a button and replaces the Cell Phone to his ear.
JIMMY (CONT'D)
Hello?
KWON'S VOICE
Jimmy?
JIMMY
Who is this?
KWON, an Asian-American in his early twenties, holding to his ear
the CORDLESS PHONE that was on the coffee table, is pacing in front
of CAR, who is still seated on the couch in the exact position we
saw him last. The GYM BAG that Jimmy emptied earlier is on the
floor at his feet. We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Kwon.
KWON
You don't have caller ID?
JIMMY
I'm driving.
Who is this?
KWON
Kwon.
JIMMY
Hey, Kwon.
What's up?
Where are you?
KWON
I'm on my cousin's phone.
JIMMY
Where's Car?
KWON
He's right here. He said you guys were
supposed to meet.
Jimmy runs a yellow light that turns red while he's still crossing
the intersection.
JIMMY
He did? Well, yeah, I stopped by this
morning. Nobody was there.
KWON
You didn't come in?
JIMMY
No.
Nobody answered the door.
51
KWON
Well, you want to come by now? I'll be
here. You can make your pick-up.
JIMMY
Can't do it now. I'm delivering on the
other side of town.
KWON
Deliveries? Jimmy, fuck the pizza.
Stop
by and get your shit.
JIMMY
I can't.
What's the big deal?
Jimmy, very anxious, runs a red light.
A CAR going the other way
stops and honks.
KWON
Jimmy, my cousin's dead, and there's a
shitload 'a shit missing from our house.
JIMMY
Car?
KWON
What do you think?
JIMMY
I don't know.
The TRAFFIC in front of Jimmy slows, and Jimmy coasts to a
standstill at the tail of the traffic and in the middle of a busy
intersection.
KWON
I want you to come over here and tell me
everything that happened when you stopped
by.
JIMMY
Nothing happened, Kwon.
I knocked and no
one answered.
KWON
You didn't ring the doorbell?
Jimmy's light turns yellow while he is still at a standstill in the
middle of the intersection.
JIMMY
That's what I meant.
KWON
And no one answered.
52
JIMMY
No.
No one answered.
KWON
You left a message on our house phone this
morning. Why didn't you call our cells
when you got here?
Jimmy's light turns red, and he is still at a standstill in the
middle of the intersection. A CAR at the head of the cross traffic
inches up to Jimmy's Piece-of-Shit and honks, but Jimmy does not
seem to notice.
JIMMY
(stumped)
Why didn't I call.
Good question.
KWON
What the fuck do I care, you think it's a
good question?! Are you fucking kidding
me?!
JIMMY
Look, I didn't think of it.
I got a lotta
shit on my mind right now.
KWON
Jimmy, do you have my drugs?
JIMMY
No.
The cross traffic honking grows louder, even though there is nowhere
for Jimmy to go.
KWON
Alright.
If you hear anything, you call
me.
JIMMY
I will.
Sorry about Car.
KWON
Thanks, Jimmy.
Jimmy hangs up.
Cars are still honking at Jimmy as he continues to sit at a
standstill in the intersection.
53
JIMMY
(generally to the other
drivers)
Fuck off!
Jimmy throws his Piece-of-Shit in reverse, then cuts left, through
and out of the intersection.
Jimmy slides the Backpack into his apartment. TIGHT on the backpack
as it slides across the hardwood floor, straight towards the camera,
to a halt immediately in front of the camera. Jimmy steps back
outside and shuts the door.
AARON returns from the kitchen drinking from a can of SODA. TROY
and PITT are on the couch, VIDEO GAME CONTROLLERS in their hands,
waiting for the VIDEO GAME to load. Troy is lighting a CIGARETTE.
AARON
(to Troy)
C'mon, let's go find her.
TROY
I'm not gonna go scouring the countryside
lookin' fer her.
AARON
Gimme yer keys.
PITT
(to Troy)
Don't give him your keys.
54
AARON
(to Pitt)
You want a smack? I am seriously gonna
smack yer ass.
PITT
Don't give me no attitude, just cause you
got mushrooms growin' on your balls.
AARON
(to Troy)
Let's go, man.
(re Pitt)
Fuck this asshole.
TROY
No, man, I don't wanna see you hittin'
Jess neither.
The PHONE on the coffee table rings.
Pitt picks it up.
PITT
Dominoes.
(a beat, then to Aaron)
It's her.
Pitt tosses the Phone to Aaron.
Aaron is walking into the kitchen, and although he is furious, he is
keeping his voice down so that Pitt and Troy do not hear. Cut back
and forth between Aaron in his house and Jessica in Carlos' Car.
AARON
Jess, I'm serious.
We need to talk about
this.
JESSICA
Isn't that what we're doing?
AARON
Fine!
Who'd you fuck?
55
JESSICA
Nobody.
AARON
Bull-fuckin'-shit! I got bumps on my
dick, and I never cheated!
JESSICA
Maybe its just a rash, 'cause I don't have
anything.
AARON
Why don't we go to the doctor and get you
checked out?
JESSICA
I can go to the doctor by myself.
And if
I have it, I got it from you!
AARON
You're fuckin' fulla shit!
JESSICA
Whatever. If you come after me again, I'm
gonna find someone to kick your ass. I
mean it.
AARON
I believe it, you fuckin' whore! 'Cause
it's probably the same dude you been
bangin' behind my back!
JESSICA
I never cheated.
AARON
Tell Carlos I'm gonna kick his ass.
Aaron hangs up.
Back to Jessica and Carlos in Carlos' parked Car.
CARLOS
(anxious)
What's up?
JESSICA
He's pissed.
Says he's gonna kick our
asses.
CARLOS
Great.
I got a baseball bat in the trunk.
56
JESSICA
Good.
CARLOS
I gotta go to work in an hour.
JESSICA
Call in sick.
CARLOS
Yeah, maybe. You mean it when you said
you were gonna find someone to kick his
ass?
JESSICA
Yeah.
CARLOS
Who?
JESSICA
You don't know him. He graduated before
us.
Jessica notices something, turning to look out the broken passenger-
side window. She's stares, interested.
CARLOS
He a big dude?
JESSICA
(still staring out the
window)
Not really, but he gets into fights all
the time, at parties and stuff. And he
knows a lot of people.
Through the window, we see that Carlos' Car is parked across the
street from Car's house, and that a POLICE CAR and a CORONER'S VAN
are parked in front of it. Kwon is standing with a POLICE OFFICER,
more distraught than the last time we saw him, answering questions.
He's oblivious to Jessica and Carlos.
CARLOS
Call him.
JESSICA
I'd rather go over in person.
CARLOS
Why?
Jessica turns back to Carlos.
57
JESSICA
(not exactly confident)
I can be more... persuasive in person.
Jessica punches another number into her Cell Phone.
CARLOS
(disappointed)
Swell.
KATIE'S VOICE
Hello, this is Katie Kinney!
JESSICA
Katie, it's Jessica.
KATIE'S VOICE
Where are you?
JESSICA
Have you eaten?
KATIE'S VOICE
I'm starving!
JESSICA
Okay, I'm going to be home in a little
bit, okay?
KATIE'S VOICE
Alright.
Jessica hangs up and throws her Cell Phone on top of the dashboard.
JESSICA
Drive.
Carlos starts the Car.
HEATHER is sitting on the examining table, topless, holding her
breath as DR. COOK runs a STETHOSCOPE on different areas of her
back. Heather's BLOUSE and PURSE are lying on the examining table
beside her.
DR. COOK
Breathe out.
Heather lets her breath out.
DR. COOK (CONT'D)
It's official. You're as healthy as you
were last week, and last week you were as
healthy as an ox.
HEATHER
Are you sure you're using that thing
right? I feel this ache
(indicating her chest)
Right here, like I'm being crushed between
two boards.
DR. COOK
Nobody's crushing you.
Honest. I'm sure.
It's all in your head.
I know a couple
quacks...
HEATHER
I don't need a head doctor!
DR. COOK
I was just kidding there.
Heather reaches into her PURSE and lights a CIGARETTE. Dr. Cook
sighs - they've had a discussion about Heather's smoking before.
61
DR. COOK (CONT'D)
Heather, if you're going to insist on
ignoring my rules, at least put your
blouse on before you light up.
Heather hops off the bench and makes a sudden about-face. She is
gesturing wildly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she is half-
naked.
HEATHER
Can't I be concerned about my health?!
Is
that so outrageous?!
Dr. Cook is clearly uncomfortable conversing with Heather while her
breasts are exposed.
DR. COOK
Heather...
HEATHER
I just don't want to be walking around
tomorrow and drop dead because my heart
collapses, and so that makes me weird or
paranoid...
DR. COOK
Heather, there's nothing wrong with being
concerned about your health. Please put
your blouse back on.
Heather grabs her Blouse from the table and puts it back on.
DR. COOK (CONT'D)
So I'll see you next week then.
HEATHER
(suddenly friendly again)
Okay, yeah, see you next week.
Heather leaves and shuts the door behind her.
LOW ANGLE MEDIUM on ALLISON bent over the bed, mouth agape. She
buries her face in the mattress, revealing DEREK thrusting from
behind. Derek climaxes. Allison pops up from below.
ALLISON
I'm two pounds heavier I think.
62
Derek lies back to put his head on the pillow.
DEREK
Sorry.
Allison lies on top, nestling her head in his chest.
ALLISON
It hurt. I knew it would hurt, but that
was kinda worse than I thought. Does
Heather... like it?
DEREK
She never let's me do it.
ALLISON
She doesn't?
Why not?
DEREK
I don't know. She does shave though.
How
come you don't shave?
ALLISON
I don't know. I don't want to.
Do you
love her?
DEREK
I don't know.
ALLISON
How can you not know?
DEREK
She's got problems.
ALLISON
I don't understand you. Why do you even
cheat on her with me? She's so pretty.
So much prettier than me.
DEREK
She's
a nutcase. I'll tell you what, I
don't
know why you do it. You should have
a man
of your own - we say it all the
time,
me and Heather.
ALLISON
Yeah, who? That slob you and Heather
introduced me to last time?
DEREK
He outranks me. He's a good guy.
63
ALLISON
Like me, I'm a good girl, and the best I
can do is a guy that looks like that?
DEREK
No.
ALLISON
You must think so. You tried to set me up
with him.
DEREK
I thought it was a bad match.
It was
Heather's idea.
ALLISON
So she thinks I can't do better.
DEREK
You know what she thinks better than me.
Allison climbs out of bed, and her mood changes from thoughtful to
business-like. She begins putting her CLOTHES on.
ALLISON
Let's get dressed, she'll be here.
Derek looks calmly over at the ALARM CLOCK on the nightstand.
DEREK
Let's let her walk in on us, and look
surprised.
ALLISON
Hurry up.
Allison opens the door and walks out, a little bow-legged.
JIMMY walks through the front door. PIZZA POP spots him immediately
from behind the counter. The PHONE rings, but Pizza Pop ignores it.
PIZZA POP
Hey-a Jimmy.
Where you been?
JIMMY
Around.
Deliverin'.
PIZZA POP
Hurry - sit down Anna eat something.
We
got more deliveries for you.
Jimmy walks around the counter, grabs a couple of SLICES and throws
them in the oven. Pizza Pop picks up the Phone.
64
PIZZA POP (CONT'D)
(into the Phone)
Poppy's!
The door bursts open and JESSICA enters, followed by CARLOS.
KATIE
is watching TV.
JESSICA
Did your parents call?
KATIE
Nope!
Where were you?
JESSICA
Out with Carlos.
Jessica disappears into the kitchen.
KATIE
The VCR is broken.
Jessica tosses a FROZEN DINNER into the microwave.
JESSICA
(yelling to Carlos in the
living room)
'Los, are you hungry?!
CARLOS (O.S.)
I guess.
Jessica places two Frozen Dinners, complete with a FORK apiece, down
on the coffee table. Katie grabs her Fork.
KATIE
Are we going to have TV dinners all
weekend?
JESSICA
No.
I promise. You want some milk?
KATIE
Can I have ice-tea?
JESSICA
Of course.
(to Carlos)
Can you make her some ice-tea?
65
CARLOS
Aren't you gonna eat?
JESSICA
I'm gonna take a shower.
Carlos is disappointed that Jessica wants to fix herself up to see
Carter. Katie is already eating.
We're behind JESSICA as she removes her SHORTS and her SHIRT.
Katie now has a glass of ICE-TEA in front of her.
Carlos is behind
the TV and VCR, fiddling with the wires.
KATIE
Are you Jessica's new boyfriend?
CARLOS
No.
KATIE
I wish you were. I don't like Aaron.
CARLOS
Neither do I.
KATIE
Don't you like Jessica?
CARLOS
Kind of, I guess. She's nice.
Jessica showering, obscured by the semi-opaque glass shower doors.
HEATHER, ALLISON and DEREK are seated at the table with CHINESE
TAKE-OUT in front of them. A NEWSPAPER opened to the classifieds
lies near Derek's place at the table. Derek and Allison are chowing
down while Heather sits watching Derek. Derek is using a FORK.
HEATHER
Take a look at that paper. There's at
least a half dozen apartments I circled
that would be perfect.
Derek continues chowing down, not responding.
Derek's CELL PHONE
rings, and he answers it.
66
DEREK
Yeah?
(beat)
You're joking.
(beat)
Alright, ten minutes.
Derek hangs up, stands up, and puts the Cell Phone in his pocket.
HEATHER
(guessing at the purpose
of the call, completely
frustrated)
Great.
DEREK
That was Tess. Said I had to come back
in.
HEATHER
Are you fucking Tess?
DEREK
What? No. Look, I gotta go. I'll see
you at Carter's when I get off.
Derek takes another bite, gets up and heads for the door.
HEATHER
I'm not dropping this!
DEREK
Since when do you drop anything?
Derek exits as Heather's eyes hang on him.
HEATHER
You see that? He practically said yes.
Heather gets up and walks in the direction of Derek's bedroom.
Allison instinctively rises and follows.
ALLISON
What're you doing?
HEATHER
I'm gonna look through his shit.
Heather walks over to the bed and starts rifling through the mess on
the nightstand. She picks up a tube of ASTROGLIDE and nonchalantly
throws it on the bed.
67
ALLISON
You're finally flipping, I think.
HEATHER
You're a lot of help, Ally.
Really.
Thanks.
Heather opens the nightstand drawer and immediately pulls out a box
of CONDOMS, showing them to Allison.
HEATHER (CONT'D)
See?!
See?!
ALLISON
So what.
Condoms.
HEATHER
Ally, I'm on the fucking pill. He hasn't
used condoms with me for weeks.
ALLISON
So maybe those are left-overs.
HEATHER
Ally, these are not left-overs.
He never
used regular condoms with me.
ALLISON
(caught off guard)
Why not?
HEATHER
Because if he did, he took two fucking
days to come. I always made him wear
ultra-thin, ribbed, anything but this
shit.
ALLISON
He took too long for you?
HEATHER
Ally, I'd be done, and I'd have to lie
there like another hour 'till he got off.
I couldn't fucking stand it. Why the hell
do you think I started on the pill, Ally?
Me. Putting that hormone shit in my body.
ALLISON
How would I know?
HEATHER
Well that's why.
(remembering)
Anyway, that's neither here nor fucking
there. That asshole is using
68
(re Condoms)
these things, and not on me.
ALLISON
Just call him and ask him.
HEATHER
No, no, fuck that. We're going to go to
the party, have some fun. When he's all
good and drunk, you're going to ask him
when I'm not around.
ALLISON
Yeah right.
HEATHER
Ally, I'm serious. If he's drunk and
having fun, and you just work it in on him
real casual, he may slip. He'll never
admit shit to me.
ALLISON
He won't to me either.
HEATHER
Ally!
Just fucking try it!
ALLISON
I don't wanna spy on him for you!
HEATHER
Ally, look, he's cheating on me, I know it
in my heart, but I want him to admit it,
alright? Before I fucking flush what's
left of this shithole relationship down
the toilet, I want him to admit it.
ALLISON
Fine, I'll see.
HEATHER
Fine.
Dave is standing in front of finishing up blending a PROTEIN DRINK,
holding a CORDLESS PHONE to his ear. Cut back and forth between
Jimmy and Dave.
70
DAVE
Hey man, it's Dave.
I got happy news for
you.
JIMMY
You want the juice?
DAVE
I told ya, I got plenty. But about the
other stuff, I been thinkin' 'bout your
problem, and I know a guy who could help
you out. Buy a lot a' your shit all at
once.
JIMMY
The juice?
DAVE
No, no. I'm talkin' 'bout the coke an'
shit. I might know somebody.
JIMMY
(lowering his voice in
case Kwon comes back)
Who?
DAVE
This spear-chucker from Manville. Sold me
some fake D-ball once. I tied his
brother's dog to my front bumper and we
talked it out. Turned out to be an okay
guy. I gave him a call and he's
definitely lookin'.
JIMMY
For how much?
Dave, having walked into the living room, takes a seat on the couch
next to the FEMALE PASSENGER we saw earlier, her head now bandaged.
She is snorting a line of COKE off of the coffee table.
DAVE
Well, he's pretty small time, but he's
itchin' to move up a few notches.
JIMMY
He's got money?
DAVE
He talks so much shit it's hard to tell.
You need to talk to him.
Jimmy considers, then pulls a PEN and his DELIVERY LIST out of his
pocket. He turns the Delivery List over to write on the back.
71
JIMMY
Gimme his number, man.
Pete is sitting on the floor repairing a WEED-WACKER.
PETE
You done already?
Corey hops off the Lawn Mower.
COREY
I got an emergency, Pete. I'll come in
early tomorrow and finish.
He runs out the door.
PETE
Hey!
COREY
(running out the door)
Sorry!
The door slams shut behind Corey.
From the inside we can see that Carter's house is the same house
that Jerry moved out of this morning - Jerry was Carter's housemate.
Heather and Allison walk in as if they know their way around.
Carter spots a large clay LAWN DWARF on the back porch. He reaches
for it.
CARTER
Stay outta my room.
Heather holds out the vodka.
HEATHER
Wanna shot?
CARTER
Later.
I wanna see how crazy it gets.
HEATHER
Skirt.
Carter props the screen door open with the Lawn Dwarf.
Carlos's CAR is parked in street in front of Carter's house, just
down the street from where Pedro has parked, but on the opposite
side of the street and facing in the opposite direction. Through
the windshield, we see Berubi head back toward the house as Pedro
glances at Jessica, now showered and dressed in a yellow tank-top,
before climbing back into the Tow Truck and pulling back out onto
the road. Carlos has noticed Pedro, but Jessica, silent as she
stares at the house, has not.
Finally, Carlos speaks up.
CARLOS
Did you know he was having a party?
Jessica grabs the rear view mirror and aims it toward herself.
She
begins fixing her hair in the mirror.
She pulls her LIPSTICK out of her PURSE and begins to apply it as
Carlos watches. She puts her Lipstick away and stares at Carter's
house another moment. She checks to see that her SUNGLASSES are
still hanging on the front of her shirt.
JESSICA
Let's go.
JESSICA
Oh. You didn't tell me that.
Is he
pissed?
CARTER
Who gives a shit? He moved out.
JESSICA
Carter, I gotta talk to you for a sec.
CARTER
I gotta wash my hands.
Carter is just not interested in talking with Jessica, even if he
didn't have other things on his mind. Carter enters bathroom, but
Jessica follows persistently.
Carter turns on the sink and washes his hands.
79
JESSICA
I got a problem.
CARTER
Yeah.
JESSICA
It's Aaron, that asshole.
He's pissed at
me.
CARTER
So what am I, a goddam marriage counselor?
JESSICA
No, but Aaron hit me, and he's gonna do it
again.
CARTER
He hit you?
Jessica sees that Carter has finally shown some interest.
JESSICA
Yes.
CARTER
Like, he slapped you?
JESSICA
No, he punched me. With his fist, a bunch
'a times.
CARTER
Why?
What'd you do?
JESSICA
I didn't do shit.
CARTER
Look, I ain't gonna sit here all night.
Tell me what happened. None 'a your
bullshit.
JESSICA
Aaron thinks I cheated on him.
This strikes Carter.
CARTER
Why's he think that?
JESSICA
It doesn't matter.
80
CARTER
Fine.
Carter starts to walk out, but Jessica stops him.
JESSICA
Alright, alright. He caught something -
he got a rash or something. He says I
gave it to him.
CARTER
He's got a rash?! Are you fuckin' kiddin'
me?! What the hell'd he catch?! Fuckin'
herpes?!
JESSICA
Carter!
Carter notices that the door to the bathroom is still open.
Although music is blasting outside, and it is unlikely that anyone
could hear their conversation, Carter closes the door and locks it.
CARTER
What the hell'd you give him?!
JESSICA
Nothing! He's fulla shit!
I did not
cheat on him!
CARTER
Fuckin' A!
You slept with me, like, three
weeks ago!
JESSICA
That was the only time, that once, and
there's no way he knows.
CARTER
And you have something?!
JESSICA
No! Are you fucking listening to me?!
And you wore a condom anyway! What the
fuck do you care!
CARTER
Whatever, Jess, what-the-fuck-ever.
And
I'm sure I'm the only one.
JESSICA
Look, don't even get into the cheating
thing, 'cause you're seein' Rachel still.
Don't call me the slut.
81
CARTER
Look, I'm not gettin' into it with you.
I'm through with that bullshit.
JESSICA
Fine. Just, I need your help with Aaron.
Just help me this one last time, that's
it.
CARTER
He's probably gonna be here tonight,
Aaron.
JESSICA
You're kidding. You barely even know who
he is!
CARTER
No, but I know Troy real good. He said
he'd be bringin' him. I ain't got nothin'
against Aaron, so I said "what the hell."
JESSICA
Look, can you just kick his ass for me?
Please?
CARTER
Shit, Jess, I don't wanna be fightin' no
friend 'a Troy's. Can't you just work
this shit out?
JESSICA
Carter, he hit me! And sprayed me with
pepper spray!
CARTER
What the hell.
Carter contemplates, and Jessica realizes that the best thing to do
is keep silent and let Carter's good side take over.
CARTER (CONT'D)
Look, if he tries anything tonight, I'll
do something.
JESSICA
What'll you do?
CARTER
Whadda you mean what'll I do?!
(facetious)
I'm gonna dance with him! Fuckin' I'll
beat his ass! I don't wanna, but if he
shows up tonight and makes like he's gonna
hit you, I'll beat his ass.
82
JESSICA
What if he doesn't come?
CARTER
Troy said he was bringin' him. If he
doesn't, call him or somethin'. But I'm
not a fuckin' bounty hunter whose gonna
chase Aaron across the goddam country.
Jessica is not completely satisfied, but Carter has decided what
he's going to do, and that's that.
CARTER (CONT'D)
Alright?
JESSICA
Alright, fine.
CARTER
You're welcome.
Carter exits, leaving the door open, but Jessica doesn't follow.
Jimmy steps through the open screen door into the kitchen.
HEATHER (O.S.)
Hey, there he is! Jimmy!
HEATHER and ALLISON are playing CARDS at the kitchen table with a
male PARTYGOER. They jump up from the table and approach Jimmy.
Jimmy pulls three small bags of MARIJUANA out of his BACKPACK.
Allison pulls out some BILLS.
JIMMY
Thirty bucks.
ALLISON
(counting Bills)
I only got ten.
JIMMY
I don't believe this shit.
83
ALLISON
(finishing counting)
Nine.
JIMMY
You got nine! Jesus Christ!
You knew
what you asked for!
HEATHER
Jimmy, relax. My God.
JIMMY
No, this is fuckin' ridiculous. What'd
you call me for? I ain't runnin' a goddam
soup kitchen here.
HEATHER
(mock seductive)
Can't you just take care of us for
tonight?
JIMMY
Yes, for thirty bucks.
ALLISON
Here then, take nine for one.
JIMMY
It's ten.
HEATHER
You know what? You need to get laid,
Jimmy. Maybe you'd relax a little.
JIMMY
Fine.
Enjoy your night.
Jimmy as he stuffs the Marijuana back in his Backpack and heads into
the hallway.
HEATHER
Well I'm not going to drop to my knees for
a lousy dimebag, so fuck him.
The door is shut.
JESSICA is talking on her CELL PHONE.
JESSICA
(trying to muster a sweet
voice)
What are you doing?
KATIE'S VOICE
Watching TV.
84
JESSICA
Did your parents call?
KATIE'S VOICE
Yeah.
I told them you were in the shower.
JESSICA
Okay... good. Thanks.
Are you okay?
KATIE'S VOICE
Oh, hold on!
This is my favorite part!
A cartoon becomes audible through Jessica's Cell Phone - KATIE has
put her phone up to the TV. Jessica listens impatiently.
KATIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Can you hear it?
JESSICA
Yeah, I can hear it.
(hurriedly)
Katie?
But Katie has already put her phone up to the TV again. Jessica
waits, turning to face the door, wondering what's going on the other
side of it.
Jimmy scans the cramped kitchen. Partygoers are talking, laughing,
carrying on, making out in the way that Partygoers will. Jimmy's
gaze wanders mechanically to anther part of the kitchen falls upon
the entrance to the living room. The terribly familiar figure,
BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, stands tall, proud, talking to several
Partygoers, the light behind him adding a regal air to his menacing
frame - a transcendent silhouette for a hellish vision. Bobby
towers easily over his peers. In his powerful hands he holds a tiny
notepad on which he scribbles as his clients eagerly place their
bets.
RJ, a young African-American early-twenty-something, easily six feet
tall, built like a powerlifter, his worn-out t-shirt doing little to
hide his powerful frame, appears behind Jimmy.
RJ
You're Jimmy?
Jimmy turns around to face RJ.
JIMMY
You're Sinjin?
RJ
RJ. Sinjin said you'd be wearin' a
bookbag. They're back here.
87
JESSICA moves past RJ and Jimmy toward the back door. As RJ about-
faces to lead Jimmy out of the kitchen and deeper into the house, we
follow Jessica outside.
Jessica and Carlos are staring through the window at the CARD game
taking place at the kitchen table. HEATHER and ALLISON are back at
it with the male PARTYGOER they were playing with earlier, as well
as CARD PLAYER, who has recently joined them. Heather is smoking a
CIGARETTE. Card Player is dealing a round of asshole. All are
visibly drunk.
HEATHER
(examining her Cards)
What's dickhead doing? I knew he was
lying.
Jessica turns toward the steps leading out onto the back yard, and
Carlos follows. Heather and Card Player each place one card face-
down on the table, exchanging one for the other.
HEATHER (CONT'D)
(to Card Player)
This is your best card?
CARD PLAYER
I ain't happy about it.
HEATHER
Shut up and drink, asshole.
(to Allison)
I should call him.
Card Player obeys and drinks.
ALLISON
He said he'll be here.
HEATHER
He's probably got that Tess on all fours,
fucking the shit out of her like the skank
she is.
(thinking about it)
No, you're right, fuck him.
(throwing three fours
down on the table face-
up)
Drink. Fucking everyone drink.
89
All obey Heather.
We recognize the room as Jerry's old bedroom, empty except for a bed
stripped of it's sheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a
small TV on top of it, and a few posters and scraps of trash that
have been left behind. JIMMY and RJ are looking across the room at
SINJIN, a young African-American male about RJ's age, with an
average build, sharply dressed in a button-down, and sport coat.
Sinjin has his back to Jimmy, and is bouncing up and down on a rusty
old POGO STICK - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his
stylish threads. LOUIE, an overweight, slobbish Caucasian male a
few years older than Sinjin, sits in a rickety old WHEELCHAIR that
might creak even more than Sinjin's pogo stick - in Louie's lap
rests a BOWLING BALL BAG. Upon seeing Sinjin and Louie, Jimmy
fondles his WATER BOTTLE nervously. He turns around to watch RJ
closing the door behind them.
LOUIE
Sinjin!
Sinjin spins on the Pogo Stick and spots RJ and Jimmy standing at
the entrance. Sinjin loses his balance and places a foot on the
ground. He steps off the Pogo Stick and composes himself after his
exhaustive venture.
SINJIN
Mr. Pizzaman! What's up?
(referring to Jimmy's
BACKPACK)
Got any calzones in there?
Sinjin tosses the Pogo Stick aside.
SINJIN (CONT'D)
(re the Pogo Stick)
It's harder than it looks.
Sinjin turns the GARBAGE CAN over and sits on it while motioning to
the bed.
SINJIN (CONT'D)
(comfortably, to Jimmy)
Sit down, man, sit down.
RJ walks over to lock the door as Jimmy inches closer into the room.
RJ
Yo, door don't lock.
90
SINJIN
Well you got to stand your big
muthafuckin' ass outside then, 'cause
ain't nobody comin' in here.
Everybody looks at RJ.
RJ
I don't give a shit.
RJ steps out and shuts the door behind him.
SINJIN
Alright.
Jimmy, sit down, sit down.
Jimmy is clearly uncomfortable at the sight of these two.
JIMMY
I like to stand usually.
SINJIN
Alright. I'm Sinjin.
That legless waste
is Louie.
LOUIE
I got legs little Massey muthafucka.
JIMMY
(to Sinjin)
I thought it was gonna be just me an' you.
SINJIN
It is. Don't be worryin' Louie - he's
just here to have a good time.
JIMMY walks in from living room looking for Bobby. He continues on
toward the back door leading out onto the back porch.
A dense gathering of PARTYGOERS is packed tight within the confines
of Carter's room, rather small despite being the largest bedroom in
the house. The collection of Partygoers are watching with religious
fervor the basketball game playing from the modest TV in the room.
CARTER, BERUBI, AARON and TROY are among the crowd. All those
gathered here have an interest in the game, but none as much as
BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, who stands back against the far wall though
the nobody in the congregation dares venture into his sightline of
the television. Partygoers yell in unison at various events
displayed on the screen. The door opens, and Pedro peeks into the
room.
BERUBI
Shut the door!
Pedro shuts the door.
HEATHER and ALLISON are sitting on a couch facing each other, very
drunk and extremely happy. The coffee table in front of them is
filled with plastic CUPS and LIQUOR BOTTLES, many of which are
empty.
93
ALLISON
Hey!
Fuck... you! I would never!
HEATHER
Alright, alright! You little slut! I got
one for you!
(pointing to someone off
camera)
Right over there in front of the door!
Looking down the hallway outside Jerry's bedroom we see RJ standing
against the door. He does not notice the girls looking at him from
the living room.
ALLISON
(thoughtfully)
Well, he's got a nice body. He's a little
scary looking ... he scares me.
HEATHER
You like it, too, you little slut!
ALLISON
Whatever!
You're the slut!
HEATHER
No!
No! Alright, okay, yeah!
Maybe!
(grabbing a bottle of
VODKA and a Cup)
Bring him a drink!
Allison grabs for the Vodka, but Heather does not let go.
HEATHER (CONT'D)
(motherly tone)
No, Ally, this one is for me. You take
that handsome boy one of these other...
(picking up and putting
down various empty Liquor
Bottles before finally
grabbing a bottle of
TEQUILA with a bit left)
... take him this!
ALLISON
Do we have any yogurt left?
HEATHER
I think so.
Heather takes another hit of Vodka.
ALLISON has her head back on the couch as HEATHER lights a
CIGARETTE. MITCH approaches the ladies with a BEER in his hand.
Mitch is a staunch thirty-something mechanic with a beer-gut,
dressed in Levis overalls, and wearing a backwards baseball cap and
a beard that together hide much of his head.
MITCH
(primarily to Heather)
Hey girls, what're you drinking?
HEATHER
Vodka.
MITCH
What're you mixing it with?
HEATHER
Vodka.
MITCH
Really? A little girl like you. You
think I might get you to share a little of
that?
HEATHER
I don't know. There's not much left.
MITCH
If you do something nice for me, I might
do something nice for you.
HEATHER
I'm not that kind of girl.
95
MITCH
No?
(regarding Allison)
How about your friend here?
ALLISON
Oh, now you want to talk to me?
While Mitch is searching for an answer, a familiar voice cuts over
the background noise.
PEDRO (O.S.)
Mitch!
There you are!
PEDRO is approaching from the kitchen carrying a nearly-full BEER.
Mitch seems a bit disappointed to see him.
MITCH
Hey.
PEDRO
We're outside by the woods. We got the
Mustang, mehn. It's beautiful.
MITCH
Yeah, I'll be out in a minute.
ALLISON
I feel nauseous.
MITCH
(to Heather and Allison,
regarding Pedro)
This is Pedro. We worked together 'til
last week.
PEDRO
(to Mitch)
Vamos, these girls aren't interested in
you.
MITCH
(dumbfounded)
Pedro... what the fuck...
PEDRO
Come on, mehn. Come check out the
Mustang.
Pedro leaves and Mitch follows.
ALLISON
Oh shit, I think I'm gonna be sick.
96
Allison plops down on all fours, and begins vomiting violently.
Heather kneels down next to Allison and pulls her hair back so it
doesn't get hit by the vomit.
HEATHER
That's nasty.
Allison has a few more convulsions.
ALLISON
Fuck you.
HEATHER
Wanna wash your mouth out?
Allison sits up, fixes her hair, then grabs the VODKA from Heather.
Allison takes a mouthful, rinses, and spits. Allison then takes a
drink.
HEATHER (CONT'D)
My God, Ally.
PARTYGOERS yell in unison at various events displayed on the screen.
JIMMY is off to the side of the room talking to BOBBY.
BOBBY
You know I don't get involved with that
shit. You sell your drugs and pay what
you owe.
JIMMY
That's what I'm doing! Bob, just listen
to me! I'm selling, but it's Sinjin.
BOBBY
Sayeed's little brother?
JIMMY
Yes. And Louie and RJ.
Fucking three
guys.
BOBBY
One of 'em's a cripple.
Don't make such a
big deal.
JIMMY
A cripple 'cause he got shot!
All I want
you to do is just sit there!
BOBBY
Fuckin' sit there and what?
Pull my
fuckin' cock...
JIMMY
(interrupting)
And nothin'! Goddamit fuckin' Bob, I'll
handle everything. Everything. You just
sit your big fuckin' ass there, it'll be
enough. They won't fuck with you, bein'
in prison and shit.
98
BOBBY
Jimmy, I ain't in a mood to help you right
now. I really ain't. You're wreckin' my
livelihood. Soon no one pays me. And I
fuckin' help you? You're a thorn in my
balls.
JIMMY
Look Bobby, alright, I told 'em I had a
partner, that's you. You're gonna help me
now or you're not. And if you don't, I'm
a little fucked.
BOBBY
What the hell's the matter with you? What
the fuck is going on in your head? You
comin' to me, knowin' I'm pissed at you,
and what for.
Jimmy is losing it, his grip on reality.
He's drowning, grasping
for anything that floats.
JIMMY
Jesus, Bobby, I'll owe you. Alright?
I'll owe you. Just help me out here.
Help me.
DEREK is traveling on a busy road, with the sirens of his Police Car
activated. CARS are pulling over to let him pass, but it is taking
some time. He pulls out his CELL PHONE and punches in some numbers.
The room is crowded with PARTYGOERS. The CORDLESS PHONE is ringing,
and DRUNK PARTYGOER answers it, clearly drunk. We cut back and
forth between Derek and Drunk Partygoer.
DRUNK PARTYGOER
(yelling above the noise)
Who is this?!
DEREK
A friend 'a Carter's.
DRUNK PARTYGOER
Oh, yeah, Carter! He's here!
Somewhere!
DEREK
Tell him the cops are coming. There's
been several noise complaints.
DRUNK PARTYGOER
What?!
DEREK
The cops are coming!
Tell Carter!
DRUNK PARTYGOER
Oh yeah! Okay, I got it! Cops are
comin'! Tell Carter! Who is this?!
100
DEREK
A friend 'a Carter's!
DRUNK PARTYGOER
Oh yeah, you already said that!
Drunk Partygoer hangs up and turns over to a couple of other
Partygoers.
DRUNK PARTYGOER (CONT'D)
(to Partygoers)
Cops are comin'! I'm tellin' Carter.
The other Partygoers are not impressed - they continue to sit and
drink. Drunk Partygoer loses focus and rejoins them.
ALLISON is lying on her back on the couch with her head in HEATHER's
lap. Heather is stroking Allison's hair.
They're both obliterated and just stuttering away.
HEATHER
I'm all talk. I can't cheat on Derek. I
love Derek. It's just that he makes me so
mad. And that makes me a psycho. Every
time a girl loses her temper, she's a
105
fucking psycho.
Can't I be upset without
being a psycho?
Can't I just be mad?
ALLISON
It's just every time you find a woman near
Derek, you go absolutely nuts.
HEATHER
Let's not use the word nuts, alright?
ALLISON
You know what I mean.
HEATHER
Yeah, well, don't say nuts.
ALLISON
Alright, you are mighty, mighty... not
very nice when another girl is near your
boyfriend.
HEATHER
Don't say nuts, don't say psycho, don't-
ALLISON
(interrupting)
I don't say those things.
HEATHER
Yes you do!
Yes you do!
ALLISON
What I meant, I don't mean them. I meant
that I don't mean them. That I don't mean
to say them.
HEATHER
Well, what do you mean?
ALLISON
I don't know. I mean, you get so angry,
it's a little scary.
Allison sits up on the couch. Heather sits up directly facing
Allison, her hands on Allison's lap.
ALLISON (CONT'D)
I get scared when you get all angry. You
get so mad sometimes, you start doing
things, saying things to hurt people.
Around you.
106
HEATHER
(starting to cry)
Oh, I don't mean to! I'd never say
anything to hurt you, Ally!
ALLISON
(also starting to cry)
I know. Deep down, I know.
But you get
so angry...
HEATHER
I'm so sorry! Oh, you're right! I am a
psycho! A rotten-bitch-psycho! I scare
you - Ally - who would never hurt anyone
or, or anything!
ALLISON
It's alright, I know you don't mean it!
Heather hugs Allison, who hugs back.
Both are bawling as they
embrace.
HEATHER
I don't mean it! You're my best friend!
My sister! I love you so much!
ALLISON
No, maybe you shouldn't.
Maybe I don't
deserve it!
HEATHER
You deserve it! You're so perfect!
ALLISON
Don't say that! I'm not, I'm not!
HEATHER
Yes you are!
WIDE on Heather and Allison. The noise of the party drowns out
their conversation. Allison is whispering forcefully into Heather's
ear. Heather is listening, but cannot hear. We see her lips form
the word "what?" Allison continues whispering, and Heather's face
becomes furious. She pushes Allison back.
HEATHER (CONT'D)
You fucking slut!
Heather shoves Allison hard off the couch. As Allison stumbles
roughly and attempts to recover, PARTYGOERS, mostly guys, gather
around, cheering wildly. Heather kicks furiously at Allison, who is
on all fours employing the turtle defense. We catch a glimpse of
Allison's face - she is in utter panic. Heather's foot catches
Allison square in the face, knocking her limp.
107
Most of the crowd has stopped cheering. Heather continues to kick
at Allison's limp body, and two SKINNY GUYS pull Heather away.
Heather shakes them off and leaves in a huff, while everyone is
tending to Allison.
HEATHER, visibly psychotic, and still very drunk, is making a
beeline straight for RJ, who shows no sign of noticing Heather until
she is directly in front of him.
HEATHER
(pointing to Berubi's
bedroom)
Wanna take me in there and fuck my brains
out?
RJ
Sure, I don't give a shit.
HEATHER
Fucking great, let's go.
Heather heads towards Berubi's bedroom, and RJ follows, passing
JIMMY and BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES. Jimmy looks back at RJ as he
passes.
Jimmy reenters the room he retreated from earlier, with Bobby in
tow. The room is empty.
BOBBY
What the fuck Jimmy?
JIMMY
Just hold on.
Jimmy steps further into the room and stands pensive as Bobby takes
a seat. Bobby lights up a CIGARETTE.
BOBBY
I can't figure you Jimmy.
SINJIN
(O.S.)
Where the fuck is RJ?
The door bursts open again with a violent thrash, and LOUIE fires
into view on his WHEELCHAIR with SINJIN pushing from behind.
LOUIE
Take it easy you stupid motherfucker!
108
Sinjin kicks the door shut with the back of his foot and wheels
Louie into the room. Louie is holding a half-full bottle of JACK
DANIELS in his hand, the BOWLING BALL BAG still in his lap.
SINJIN
This your partner?
JIMMY
Where you been?
SINJIN
Just gettin' a drink, Jimmy.
You took
long enough.
Sinjin wheels Louie in a haphazard, indirect arc somehow closing on
the center of the room. The doorknob rattles.
SINJIN (CONT'D)
(to Louie)
Thought that shit didn't lock.
Sinjin is staring at the door, but Louie is pre-occuppied.
LOUIE
(to Bobby)
You're Buggerin' Bobby Bales.
BOBBY
Excuse me you cripple motherfucker?
LOUIE
Buggerin' Bobby Bales.
Sayeed knows you.
BOBBY
Call me that again.
Louie takes a strong pull from the bottle of Jack.
SINJIN
Louie, shut the fuck up.
Let's just do
this.
LOUIE
Call you what again?
What everyone calls
you?
BOBBY
Yeah.
Call me that.
LOUIE
Buggerin' Bobby Bales.
Bobby stands, tosses his Cigarette aside, and marches toward Louie.
Sinjin knowingly looses his grip on the Wheelchair and steps back.
109
SINJIN
Bobby, let's relax now.
Louie may be a
fool...
Bobby grabs Louie by the collar and throws him from the Wheelchair.
Louis lands heavily on his crippled frame, dazed, the Bowling Ball
Bag dribbling onto the floor near Sinjin. Bobby grabs the
Wheelchair in both hands and begins smashing it against the wall and
into the floor.
As Jimmy and Sinjin watch, dumbfounded, the large clay LAWN DWARF we
saw earlier bursts trough the window and lands in the center of the
room. Everyone stops to stare at the Lawn Dwarf, including Bobby.
COREY, PEDRO and MITCH notice a POLICE CAR containing POLICE OFFICER
1 and POLICE OFFICER 2 as it pulls into the back yard. Pedro is
still holding the STEREO. PARTYGOERS carry on, barely concerned
that the police are breaking up the party. Police Officer 2 spots
the MUSTANG hitched to the TOW TRUCK, a look of knowing recognition
on his face.
POLICE OFFICER 2
I'll be fucked...
COREY
(staring at the lights)
Pedro, get in the truck.
PEDRO
Oh shit...
Police Officer 1 speaks into the C.B.
POLICE OFFICER 1
Hey Janice, tell Tim I found his car.
From far off, Corey understands from the manner that the police
officers have focused on the Mustang that they've been spotted.
COREY
Pedro, let's get the hell outta here!
Police Officer 2 rushes out of the car, followed by Police Officer
1.
116
Pedro turns to Mitch.
PEDRO
Coge, keep this.
Pedro practically throws the Stereo into Mitch's stomach. Mitch,
completely shocked, drops his BEER and grabs the stereo out of
instinct. Pedro darts for the passenger seat of the Tow Truck.
MITCH
What the hell am I supposed to do with
this?
PEDRO
Keep it, mehn! I gotta go!
COREY moves to the driver-side door of the Tow Truck and opens it,
and climbs behind the wheel. Pedro climbs into the passenger seat.
MITCH
You better bring that truck back!
Harvey
is pissed!
Corey starts the Tow Truck and tries to shift it into gear.
COREY
Where the hell is first?!
Pedro grabs the stick shift and throws it into first.
PEDRO
Drive, Pendejo!
Corey hits the gas, and the transmission screeches its disapproval.
PEDRO (CONT'D)
Mehn, use the clutch!
COREY
Shit!
Where!
The Tow Truck conks out.
COREY (CONT'D)
Goddammit!
PEDRO
We're fucked!
Pedro opens the door and jumps out.
Corey remains seated, frozen,
hands on the dashboard.
POLICE OFFICER 1 quickly overtakes Pedro and throws him to the
ground. POLICE OFFICER 2 rushes over to the Tow Truck and points
his GUN at Corey.
117
POLICE OFFICER 2
Out of the truck, asshole!
HEATHER and RJ are in Berubi's bedroom. Heather is on top of RJ,
and the sex is extremely rough. Heather notices the RED AND BLUE
LIGHTS continue flashing on the curtains, staring, entranced by
them. RJ looks up to see what she's staring at.
RJ
What the fuck?!
Heather does not respond as she continues bouncing up and down on
top of RJ.
POV on JIMMY, BOBBY, SINJIN and LOUIE staring at the wall opposite
the door. Bobby is still holding what's left of Louie's WHEELCHAIR.
Sinjin throws his hands up in disgust/disbelief.
We see what they're staring at - KWON is climbing clumsily through
the window. A large GUN falls heavily to the floor and KWON falls
in after it.
SINJIN
Kwon!
What the fuck are you doin'?
Kwon grabs his Gun and stands up, slightly out of breath from his
climb.
KWON
Those are my drugs.
Jimmy watches, powerless.
SINJIN
I just bought these.
KWON
From who?
(pointing his Gun at
Jimmy)
118
Jimmy? I'm not here to argue.
Just gimme
my drugs.
SINJIN
Alright, hold on. Slow down a second.
What is this shit, Jimmy?
KWON
Tell him, Jimmy.
>From O.S. a CHINESE STRESS BALL hits Kwon in the forehead. Dazed,
Kwon can only blink his eyes tries to gather his senses. Bobby
stares at Kwon a moment before landing his large fist square on
Kwon's nose, knocking him empty-handed and on his ass beside Sinjin.
Sinjin stands up to get between Bobby and Kwon.
SINJIN
Alright everybody calm the fuck down!
This shit's gettin' outta hand-
BANG! Everybody freezes as the sound and smoke of a gunshot
lingers, then checks to make sure they weren't hit. As doorknob
starts rattling with increasing intensity, everyone checks to make
sure they weren't hit, then turns to the source of the gunshot.
Louie is holding the Gun as he lays on his side, having scrambled to
grab the Gun.
The door bursts open - it's RJ, out of breath.
Police Officer 2 shoves Corey into the POLICE CAR next to Pedro.
Corey and Pedro sit in the rear of the police car, and Police
Officer 2 slams the door. Through the windshield we see Police
119
Officer 2 run toward the house as he draws his PISTOL.
He moves up
the porch past...
SINJIN marches straight toward LOUIE, who wears the pathetic look of
a child about to be disciplined.
SINJIN
Louie!
What the fuck are you shootin' at?
LOUIE
(pointing at BOBBY)
Him!
BOBBY
You missed.
SINJIN
Gimme that motherfuckin' gun.
Sinjin grabs the GUN from Louie. KWON is sitting up, still dazed,
holding a HANDKERCHIEF to stem the flow of blood streaming out of
his nose.
RJ
Cops're here.
Sinjin turns to inspect the room, contemplating the situation.
He
walks toward Jimmy's BACKPACK.
RJ (CONT'D)
We should go, Sinjin.
SINJIN
(facetious)
I'm not sure about that, RJ! Let's break
out the chalk board, some X's and O's, an'
make fer certain!
(taking command)
Just toss Louie out the fuckin' window!
KWON
Sinjin, those are my drugs.
SINJIN
(holding out the
Backpack)
These are my drugs,
(pointing at the BOWLING
BALL BAG)
That's your money.
LOUIE
(to RJ)
Easy motherfucker!
121
RJ drops Louie out the window like a sack of bird seed, Louie is
followed by the remains of his wheelchair, then by RJ himself. Kwon
stands up and grabs the bowling ball bag.
KWON
That's my gun, too.
SINJIN
(heading out the window
after RJ)
I'll send it UPS.
Sinjin disappears out the window.
Bobby is about to follow, but
turns back toward Jimmy.
BOBBY
You owe me.
Bobby exits.
Kwon stands over Jimmy.
KWON
(foreboding)
I'll see you around, Jimmy.
Jimmy watches as Kwon exits out the window.
POLICE OFFICER 2 is looking through Jerry's old bedroom, noticing
the hole in the wall. We can hear POLICE OFFICER 1 knocking on the
bathroom door in the hallway.
POLICE OFFICER 1 (O.S.)
Anybody in there? Open up! This is the
police! We're clearing everybody out!
We move past Police Officer 2 out into the hallway toward the
noise...
Policer Officer 1 is opening the bathroom door, gun raised, and is
stopped dead in his tracks by what he sees...
Two legs are hanging out the side of the bathtub, belonging to a
girl whose the rest of whose body is obscured from view.

Police Officer 1 drops his gun to his side and steps into the
bathroom, staring down into the bathtub.
Police Officer 2 walks up into the bathroom, noticing the BULLET
HOLE in the wall just beside the mirror.
POLICE OFFICER 2
Oh man...
We see what they do - EMILY is lying back across the width of the
bathtub, eyes open but utterly vacant, a gunshot wound through her
cheek just below her cheekbone.
CARTER is moving from the living room toward the bedrooms.
POLICE
OFFICER 1 stops him.
POLICE OFFICER 1
You can't come back here.
CARTER
Whadda ya mean I can't go back there.
This is my house!
Carter is persistent, and Police Officer 1 puts his hands up against
Carter.
Some of the STRAGGLERS are still scattered throughout the side of
the house opposite the bedrooms and bathroom. BERUBI is forcefully
waving them out of the house.
CARTER (O.S.)
Get your fucking hands off me!
BERUBI
Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!
Get
the fuck out!
The Stragglers exit out the front door.
Heather's body is contorted to her side to relieve the discomfort
caused by the HANDCUFFS. Through the window facing Carter's house
we see a figure approaching. As the figure nears, we recognize
DEREK, seemingly recovered from his earlier thrashing. Heather does
not notice Derek as he nears the door. Derek opens the door.
Heather looks up at him.
HEATHER
Get away from me.
Derek pulls Heather from the police car, and the exhausted Heather
gives only nominal resistance. Derek unlocks her handcuffs.
Heather turns around.
DEREK
You should get out of here before the
other officers come back.
HEATHER
Fuck you.
Heather walks past Derek, and Derek does not turn to follow her.
Heather notices ALLISON standing several car lengths away. Allison
has her arms crossed across her body as if she were hugging herself
for warmth, both her and Heather's purses strapped over her
shoulder, her KEYS dangling from her hand. Heather begins walking
slowly towards Allison, passing by...
