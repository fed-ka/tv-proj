REBECCA (CONT D)
So we are looking at 3 charges of 
polygamy and 2 counts of falsifying 
identity. It appears as though Hot 
shot here had three families at 
once. 

We see our accused polygamist: DOUGLAS RILLER. He s plain and 
unassuming.

REBECCA (CONT D)
 the player who likes to So you re
play Mr. Riller? How do you answer 
to these charges?

DOUGLAS RILLER
Not guilty your honor. I loved them 
all equally. How can love be a 
crime?

TOM
Your honor, we have expert 
testimony that Mr. Riller is a 
flight risk and request that bail 
be denied. May I call Gary Boyd to 
the witness stand.

REBECCA
Sure, if you want to extend this 
hearing...

A handsome academic looking guy, roughly the same age as 
Rebecca, is on the stand. This is GARY BOYD.

Tom struts around in front of Gary in a tight suit. Nice but 
 being extremely overdramatic as though in a tight. He s
movie.

TOM
So, Dr. Gary Boyd, in your expert 
opinion as one of the most 
prominent psychiatrists in the 
state of California, does the 
accused pose an undue risk for 
flight from the law enforcement 
officials that keep the great state 
of California safe?!

REBECCA
Prosecutor, a word.

Tom walks up to the bench.7.


REBECCA (CONT D)
You know this is just to determine 
if Romeo here is a flight risk, 
right, not an audition for A Few 
Good Men?

TOM

in the record as clearly as

REBECCA
Are tight pants part of your 
protocol too?

TOM
 These pants are fitted. And that s
not an appropriate comment for a 
court of law.

REBECCA
Just lay off the grandstanding Tom.  
And let your junk breath. You may 
want to have kids someday.

Tom returns to his seat.

REBECCA (CONT D)
Now, Dr. Boyd, please continue.

Rebecca looks at Gary, something in her is interested in more 
than just his decision.

GARY
 in my belief that the It s
delusional nature of the 
 crimes, his defendant s
narcissistic personality disorder 
and psychopathic behavior, a time 
share in Mexico, he indeed 
represents a flight risk. He was 
married to three women with three 
families for six years. In short, 
he believes he should be in Paris 
right now.

REBECCA
Mr. Riller, what do you have to say 
for yourself?

MR. DENNISON
Your honor I've got too much love 
in my heart for just one person. 
Some people say I'm not a family 
man, But I say I m  three times the 
family man that a one family man 
is.... Are you married?8.


Rebecca looks at her phone under her desk. We see several

She bangs her gavel then looks at Gary.

REBECCA (CONT D)

chambers please.

Gary and Rebecca passionately fall on top of her desk. As 
they continue to kiss, Gary takes off her robe and 
accidentally knocks her entire purse over on the floor 
spilling all of its contents.  Rebecca stops.  

REBECCA
