      Eddie, late and sweating. Editor, BILL HADLEY, grey beard, 
      grey eyes, is talking to an owlish, bespectacled man - 
      DETECTIVE SUPERINTENDENT MAURICE JOBSON. Hadley looks 
      pointedly at his watch.

                                  HADLEY
                    Sorry to hear about your father, 
                    Edward.

                                  EDDIE
                    Thanks, Mr. Hadley. He had a good 
                    innings.

                                  HADLEY
                          (to Jobson)
                    This is Detective Superintendent 
                    Jobson. Mr. Dunford s hoping to be 
                    the Post s new Crime Correspondent. 

      They shake hands.

                                    MAURICE JOBSON
                    I ve always got along very well

                                  HADLEY
                    Mr. Dunford ll be standing in. 
                    Trial period.

      Jobson watches Eddie head through the smoky room packed with 
      beery JOURNOS. TV lights, notebooks, memo recorders. 

                                    MAURICE JOBSON

                    as I understand.

      who we ll meet later. An old girlfriend mouths  hello  -

      Up front, Maurice Jobson takes the stage with DETECTIVE CHIEF 
      SUPERINTENDENT BILL MOLLOY - late 50s, a big man, a dangerous 
      man. They flank a POLICE WOMAN and a crumpled couple: MR. and 
      MRS. KEMPLAY. 

      Beside them is an enlarged school photograph of a smiling 10 
      year old girl against a backdrop of a blue sky with fluffy 
      white clouds. We recognise her as the Dead Angel. Eddie 
      switches on his memo recorder.

                    yesterday evening, 3rd September, 
                    Clare Kemplay disappeared on her 
                    way home from Morley Grange Junior 
                    and Infants. Clare is ten years 
                    old. She was wearing an red kagool, 
                    a dark blue turtleneck sweater, 
                    pale blue denim trousers and red 
                      Wellington boots. When Clare left 
                    school, she was carrying a plastic 
                    Co-op carrier bag containing a pair 
                    of black gym shoes... Mrs. Kemplay 
                    would now like to read a short 
                      statement. Thank you.

      Jobson turns the mic towards MRS. KEMPLAY. Camera flashes.

                     If it bleeds, it leads,  right?
                          (a nasty thought)
                    Reckon dad did it?

                                  MRS. KEMPLAY
                    I would like to appeal to anybody 
                    who knows where my Clare is or who 
                    saw her after yesterday teatime to 
                    please telephone the police. Clare 
                    is a very happy girl and I know she 
                    would never just run off without 
                    telling me. Please, if you know 
                    where she is or if you ve seen her, 
                    please... please... please...

      Chokes. Can t go on. The POLICEWOMAN comforts her. 

      Eddie is transfixed by Mrs. Kemplay s distress.

      front room. 

      Eddie checks his watch - looks back down the hall to see...

         Jeanette Garland from Castleford went missing yesterday... 

      A photo of the mother - PAULA GARLAND - blonde, hard-
      beautiful. Dark glasses. Head down. 



      Eddie comes through the busy open plan office. Clatter of 
      typewriters and chatter. GEORGE GREAVES - an old hand - 
      gossips with GAZ FROM SPORT. He nods at Eddie.

                    Three missing girls. Aged between 
                    eight and ten. 1969, 1972 - and 
                    then day before yesterday. All of 
                    them go missing within miles of one 
                    another. It s the A34 Murders all

                    Fingers crossed, eh.

                                  HADLEY
                    I was being sarcastic, Edward.

                    Sorry.

                    Did you talk to Jack Whitehead 
                    about this?

                    excellent relationship with our 
                    newly amalgamated Police Force. I d 
                    like to keep it that way.

      Eddie - Jumping Jack Flash - heads through the red darkness 
      of a bar in hell. Genuine Formica veneer, booze, fag smoke, a 
      small stage where A WOMAN IN A FEATHERED DRESS belts out 
       We ve Only Just Begun . 

      A table of CRONIES: Barry Gannon, George Greaves, Gaz. 
      Snatches of journo chat:

                    think...  

      Eddie glad-hands as he passes. Doesn t veer off True North: 
      the bar decked in fairy lights. Barry tags along with Eddie. 
      They shove through the CROWD.

      The bar-woman, BET, has Eddie s drink ready for him. Pint and 
      a whisky. Eddie downs the scotch, quenches it with the beer.

                    How long have you got? Everything s

                    you re about it? Death Squads. 
                    You ve fucking lost it, mate.

      Eddie looks down the bar. At the far end is Kathryn Tyler, 
      cornered by a DRUNK. She sends a rescue-me-smile to him. 

                                  BARRY
                    You re a lucky man, Dunford. You 
                    want to look after that one...

      A YOUNG MAN sidles up to Barry - orange feather cut, nervous 
      eyes, fat maroon suit. A Bowie Clone. This is BJ.

      Barry nods to a corner table. BJ throws Eddie a little smile, 
      then leaves them.

                    pleasure, did I.

      Eddie watches Barry join the strange nervy young man, BJ. A 
      secret assignation.

      Eddie drives fast. Jimmy Ruffin:  What becomes of the broken 
      hearted / Who had love that's now departed?...  

      Lights flash past. He exits the motorway - swerves to halt on 
      the hard shoulder. 



      Eddie is sprawled on the bed, fully clothed and muddy in the 
      floral room. His mother brings him tea.

      Eddie and Barry walk. Eddie looks like shit. He swallows a 
      couple of pills. He s in the middle of telling Barry about 
      the previous night.

      scowling behind his desk looking very tired and very pissed 
      off. Eddie is afraid and nervous.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      18

                    Well sir, Chief Superintendent, 
                    I was wondering if, well, if there 
                    was any news about Clare Kemplay...

                    What I m trying to say is, it 
                    turned out to be the work of one 
                    man, and Jeanette Garland and Susan *

                    likely suspects, wouldn t they...?

                                  EDDIE
                    Don t think so, sir, no...

      The buzzer goes again. Molloy s on his feet.

                                  MOLLOY
                    Good. You do your digging, son, and 
                    I ll do mine. Now fuck off. 

      Watching Eddie go is Maurice Jobson in his heavy rimmed 
      specs... He switches on a smile for Molloy.

      Eddie driving. Heater and radio on - the missing girl story

      wrapped against the biting cold, dark factories, silent 
      mills, torn election posters Wilson, Heath -  Who Governs 
      Britain?  

      Eddie pauses at the traffic lights. Across the street is 
      MORLEY GRANGE JUNIOR AND INFANTS SCHOOL. KIDS come out, 
      laughing and screeching. Eddie stares...

                    Infants School...

      He sees CLARE KEMPLAY. Red kagool, red Wellington boots, Co-
      op plastic bag. She s standing apart from the others, smiling 
      at him across the street. 

      Eddie can t hear the angry car horns behind him.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      20
                   


      Clare begins to skip along the road. Going home. Eddie drives 
      slowly - keeping pace with her. Traffic horns blare. Clare 
      pauses on the corner, waving at Eddie. 

      Eddie signals to turn up the road. A car angrily roars past 
      him. Screamed abuse. Clare s little figure vanished.



      Eddie drives up Winterbourne Avenue. A cul-de-sac of mixed 
      old and new semis. He pauses - looks across to: A POLICEMAN 
      stands on duty outside number 3. Mrs. Kemplay is at the 
      window, staring vacantly out, waiting in vain for her 
      daughter to return home. She never will. 



      Eddie marches through the clatter of typewriters and chatter. 
      Kath nervously gets to her feet. She looks terrible.

                                  EDDIE
                    And what about Clare Kemplay?

                                  HADLEY
                    It ll get solved in the next few 
                    days or never. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Who found her?

                    Builder s mate. Lad from 
                      Fitzwilliam. Edward, I m asking you 
                    to drop it. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Okay.

                                  HADLEY
                    Good. We ll let Jack handle it for 
                    the most part, shall we. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Right. Team effort.

                                  HADLEY
                    That s it. So, you ll stay away 
                    from Fitzwilliam, then...

                                  EDDIE
                      Absolutely, Mr. Hadley.



      A SIXTEEN YR. OLD BOY in tracksuit bottoms sits on the floor 
      before Eddie. He flicks lank hair out of his eyes. He s got a 
      bruise over his eye. The front room is small and dank. Eddie, 
      Martin Laws and Mary Cole watch the boy.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      25
                   


                                  MARY COLE
                    They thought he d done it, you 
                    know.

                          (to Eddie)
                    The police very quickly realised 
                    their mistake.

                                  EDDIE
                    Why did they think you d done it, 
                    Leonard?

                                    LEONARD
                    Ask them.

                                  MARY COLE
                    He s a good boy, Mr. Dunford. He 
                    didn t do nothing.

                                  EDDIE
                    Get some brass out of it, Leonard. 
                    Tell us what happened.

                                  MARTIN LAWS
                    No need for money, Mr. Dunford. 
                    It s the truth matters... Leonard 
                    can show you the place...

                                  MARY COLE
                    She was a lovely little thing.



      Eddie down into the red gloom of the Press Club. Only a FEW 
      SOULS in hell this early. He heads for Jack at the bar. 
      Jack s on a bender. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Hard at it, Jackie?

                                  JACK
                    Serves me in sickness, poverty and 
                      ignorance. Hello, Scoop. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Had a chat with Leonard Cole. 

                                  JACK
                    You naughty boy. Didn t Aunty 
                    Hadley send you home for an early 
                    bath?

                                  EDDIE
                    Heard you were over at Clare 
                    Kemplay s post-mortem...

                                  JACK
                    The police are withholding exact 
                      details... 
                          (a drunken stab)
                    Don t you have a family to go home 
                    to?

                                  EDDIE
                    Don t you?

    A shaft goes down. Jack laughs in Eddie s face... He slides 
      off his stool and stumbles towards the toilets.



      Eddie follows Jack to the urinals. Jack leans his head 
      against the tiles as he pisses.

                                  JACK
                    Keep following me like this and 
                    your friend Barry s going to get 
                    very jealous...

                                  JACK
                    What? Your friend or the post-
                    mortem?.. Yeah, I saw it... 

                                  EDDIE
                    And?

                                  JACK
                    And, a little girl was tortured, 
                    raped and strangled. In that order. 

                                  EDDIE
                    I want to know the details.

                                  JACK
                    No you don t, Scoop.

                                  EDDIE
                    Don t fuck around, Jack. 

      Jack smiles with the wisdom of the drunk.

                                  JACK
                    Whatever happened to all those 
                    novels you wanted to write but were 
                    too scared shitless to even try...

      Eddie grabs Jack - shoves him against the tiles.

                                  EDDIE
                    Tell me!

                                  JACK
                    Eddie, I am pissing down my trouser 
                    leg... Yours too...

      Eddie lets him go. Steps back. 

                                  EDDIE
                    You re all washed up. You re just a 
                    hack. 

                                  JACK
                    Such insight.



      Beethoven s Eroica blasts the player. Eddie s father s vinyl 
      collection is strewn across the floor. Eddie, in pants and 
      vest. Swigging Scotch. He manically pages through articles on 
      the missing girls - SUSAN, JEANETTE, CLARE...

      Eddie s mother enters. He stops the music. She takes in his 
      sorry state. In her hand she has a manila A4 envelope. 
      Scrawled on the envelope is one word:  Scoop . 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      28
                   


                                    EDDIE S MOTHER
                    A man left this for you, love. Nice 
                    man. Said he was a friend of yours. 
                    Jack someone...

      His mother leaves and Eddie cautiously opens the envelope... 
      Trembling, he pulls out a couple of sheets of paper. We see 
      typed words: 

                              CLARE KEMPLAY. POST-MORTEM. 

       The body measured four feet three inches and weighed seventy-
      two pounds... Presence of coal dust found beneath 
      fingernails... Facial abrasions, possibly bites were 
      noted... 

      Eddie scans. Panic rising. Horrors. Glimpsing phrases...

                      bruising... 

       Ligature marks... burns upon the neck... inserted into the 
      vagina... 

      Eddie shuffles the pages front to back to reveal a set of 
        photographs. 

      Rapid fire images flash before his eyes: 

        ABRASIONS... A SMALL HAND... A SEVERED SWAN S WING... 

                                  GEORGE GREAVES V/O

                    They d gone and stitched fucking 
                    swan wings into her back!

      They re both quiet. The horror settling.



      They drive up a dark, leafy lane lined with high walls. Fairy 
      lights are strung in the trees... 

      A big house comes into view. Uber 70s bungalow chic. A sign: 
         SHANGRILA . Red Jaguar in the gated drive.

      A DANGEROUS LOOKING MAN WITH A JASON KING MOUSTACHE comes 
      down the drive.

      Barry goes to get out.

      Eddie runs his eyes over Paula s figure as he follows her 
      into a well-furnished room. There are some new items still 
      wrapped in plastic. On the TV is the school photo: Jeanette 
      Garland against a background of blue skies and white clouds. 
      Just like Susan Ridyard.

                    Well, I m doing an article on the 
                    parents of children who have gone 
                    missing.
                          (she doesn t blink)
                    It s about how parents have coped, 
                    after all the fuss has died down.
                          (still no reaction)
                    I know this must be difficult. I 
                    mean, I know how you must have

      She turns away. In a mirror she sees Eddie take in her body.

                                  EDDIE
                    I mean, for example, do you think

                    How was "Shangrila"?

      Barry takes his time, smiles.

                                  BARRY
                    Mrs. Dawson told me my life s in 
                    danger.

                                  EDDIE
                    Bollocks. 



      Eddie spins through the files: back in time to 1972. 
      Photographs of Jeanette Garland.  Missing. Police Widen 
      Search. Police Baffled. Police Call off Search. John Garland, 
      father to Jeanette, commits suicide ... Photographs of Paula 
      Garland. Blonde, beautiful, hard...



      The noisy PUB CROWD. Eddie gets himself a drink. Whisky down 
      in one. Pint to cool his throat. Needed it. 

      In the mirror - hidden at the back of the crowd, he sees 
      Paula Garland. Damaged and pale in her red sweater. Sitting 
      alone at a table by the jukebox.

      Eddie brings his pint and a large whisky to Paula s table. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Mrs. Garland... 

      Paula s had a couple already. She looks at his cheerful grin. 
      Looks away. Feigned boredom.

                                  EDDIE
                    Seems like a nice local...

      She takes her time. 

                                  PAULA
                    It used to be.

                                  EDDIE

      Paula nods at the drinks in his hands.

                                  PAULA
                    One of them for me?

      Eddie hands her the whisky. Offers her a cigarette.

                                  EDDIE
                    Come here often, then?

                                  PAULA
                    Sounds like you re trying to pick 
                    me up, Mr, Dunford.

      Eddie laughs a little too quickly. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Hope your friends in the force 
                    don t see us together...

                                  PAULA
                    What do you mean?

                                  EDDIE
                    I got the message. You didn t need 
                    to go to the police.

                                  PAULA
                    I never said anything to the 
                    police.

                                  EDDIE
                    Who did you tell?

                                  PAULA
                    No one.

      The music changes. Diana Ross. Paula stares down into the 
      jukebox lights. Eddie studies her face.

                                  EDDIE
                    Look, I really am sorry about 
                    before. 

                                  PAULA
                          (a straight look)
                    You were doing your job. It might 
                    help find my little girl...

                                  EDDIE
                    Mrs. Garland...

                                  PAULA
                    Paula. It s Paula. 

                                  EDDIE
                    I was right out of order. I didn t 
                    know about your husband.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      36
                   


      She shrugs - tips a little more whisky.

                                  PAULA
                    Ring always felt loose to be 
                    honest. 
                          (a look just for Eddie)
                    There, that was a stupid thing to 
                    say...

      Paula finishes her whisky. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Want another?

                                  PAULA
                    Trying to get me legless?

                                  EDDIE
                    Just say...

                                  PAULA
                    Bad idea. You said sorry. Thanks  
                    for that. 

                                  EDDIE
                    I ll give you a lift home. 

                                  PAULA
                    Thanks for the drink.

      Paula pushes past Eddie - heads for the door. He watches her 
      go. Wants her... 



      Eddie smokes and waits in his car opposite Paula s house. No 
      lights on. Then in the mirror he sees Paula s figure emerge 
      out of the dark. He ditches the fag. 

      Paula pauses - as if sensing the air. Eddie scrunches himself 
      down in the seat... 

      Paula turns lets herself in through the red door.

      No lights come on. But Eddie watches her come to stand at the 
      window, smoking a cigarette. Very blonde. Very pale. 

      Does she know he s watching her?1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      37
                   



      Eddie crosses to the house. He can see Paula inside. The glow 
      of her cigarette... She turns to look at him through the 
      glass... He puts his hand against the front door. It s off 
      the catch...



      Eddie watches Paula s image in the large mirror. Her eyes are 
      on him. Velvet eyes. Red mouth. 

      Eddie s hands go out... Inches from her body... His mouth a 
      fraction from her neck... His hands go out. His mouth close. 
      Can t move closer... 

      Wants her. Can t have her...


      OMITTED5454


      OMITTED5555



      Eddie wakes from his sex dream. Still wants her. Still can t 
      have her... Sound of the phone ringing... His mothers low 
      voice, then...

                                    EDDIE S MOTHER O/S
                    Eddie? It s for you. About Barry.


      OMITTED5656



      Eddie heads fast through the steamed up cafeteria packed with 
      PRESS; LOCALS, but also NATIONALS at separate tables. 

                                  GAZ

                    top of his fucking head clean off!

                                  EDDIE
                    They re sure it s him?

    A hand on Eddie s shoulder. Jack Whitehead. Boozed up.

                                  JACK
                    Dead drunk s what I heard. 

                                  EDDIE
                    You d know, Jack! 

                                  JACK
                          (crosses himself)
                    Mea culpa, but it wasn t me getting 
                    our Dear Departed pissed up, was 
                    it.

                                  GAZ
                    Heads up! Press Conference.

      EVERYONE moves. Coats, fag packets and papers grabbed. They 
      all head out into the rain with newspapers over their heads. 
      Jack pauses - speaks quietly to Eddie.

                                  JACK
                    Sure you ve the stomach for it, 
                    Scoop?

                                  EDDIE
                    Like you, Jack?

                                  JACK
                    Oh, no. You re the man. Jack 
                      Whitehead s away from his desk just 
                    now.

      Eddie is left alone and friendless.



      Eddie drives slowly down Victoria Road. He slows as he 
      approaches the junction. Police tape streams from the lamp 
      post. A sign: FATAL ACCIDENT. A plea for information. Smashed 
      green glass has been swept into a heap.



      Eddie watches through a long lensed camera. He s across from 
         Shangrila . Eddie snaps; the front door, a figure at a 
      window, the red Jaguar in the drive. A curtain twitches at a 
      window... 

      A second, then the Jason King Moustache comes out down the 
      drive with a cricket bat in his hand. The gates open... 

      Eddie spins the wheel and is out of there fast.  



      Eddie comes through the open plan office with a folder in his 
      hand and a knavish grin on his face. Steph is scowling at him 
      from behind a beautiful vase of flowers on her desk. Eddie 
      keeps walking - mimes giving a blow job.



      Hadley reads from an A4 sheet of typing.

                                  HADLEY V/O
                          (reading)
                     We live in the Great Age of 
                      Investigative Journalism and Barry 
                    Gannon was one of the men who gave 
                    us this age. Where he saw 
                      injustice, he asked for justice. 
                    Where he saw lies, he asked for 
                    truth. Barry Gannon once said that 
                    the truth can only make us richer. 
                    For all of us who seek the truth, 
                    Barry s premature passing has left 
                    us all so much the poorer. 

      Hadley looks up. Eddie s waiting impatiently with a file in 
      his hand.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      42
                   


                                  HADLEY
                    Not overtly panegyric, is it?

                                  EDDIE
                      Panegyric? 
                          (no idea what it means)
                    No, no I don t think so... Is it 
                    going in today s?

                                  HADLEY
                    Best to wait until after the 
                    inquest. Don t wish to speak ill, 
                    but you never know what they re 
                    going to turn up... 

      Eddie smiles with dangerous charm. He opens his file and 
      pushes a couple of pieces of typed copy across to Hadley. 

                                  HADLEY
                          (scanning the copy)
                    Do we really need this? 

                                  EDDIE
                    There s been a spate of animal 
                      mutilations. Hacked about swans 
                    found over on Bretton Park...

                                  HADLEY
                    I m not stupid. Jack showed me the 
                      post-mortem. 

                                  EDDIE
                    It s background.

      Eddie stares at him. Waiting. Hating him through a polite 
      smile. Hadley shoves the copy back at him.

                                  HADLEY
                    Get some police quotes. Maybe we ll

                    I told you...

      Eddie grits his teeth at that one.

                                  EDDIE
                    What do you mean by that, sir?

      Eddie swipes Steph s flowers out the vase as he passes.

      Eddie and the Nurse Manager. Down a corridor to room 102.



      Eddie is shown into a sunny room. Flowers, over-heating, 
      Radio 3 - Mahler s Kindertotenlieder:  Now I can see why such 
      dark flames / You flashed at me... . MARJORIE DAWSON is on 
      the bed in a satin dressing gown. Trophy Wife on the verge.

                                  NURSE MANAGER
                    Mrs. Dawson? You have a visitor. 

      Marjorie Dawson opens her eyes. The Nurse Manager takes 
      Steph s flowers. 

                                  NURSE MANAGER
                    It s Eric, Mrs. Dawson. Your 
                    nephew.

                    It sometimes takes her a while to 
                    come round...

      The Nurse Manager gives Eddie a sly smile, then she s gone. 
      Marjorie Dawson stares at him. It s very hot. Eddie checks 
      the window. 

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    It s locked. Who are you?

                                  EDDIE
                    Edward Dunford. I m a journalist.

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    So, you ve been telling lies.

      She allows her gown to fall open - lets Eddie clock some 
      thigh - makes a show of covering up. She takes a cigarette - 
      lets Eddie light it for her.

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    I can t help you, Mr. Dunford.

                                  EDDIE
                    You told my colleague, Barry 
                    Gannon, his life was in danger. 

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Did I really? What a strange thing 
                    to say.

                                  EDDIE
                    He was killed that night.

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    How terrible.

                                  EDDIE
                    You didn t know?

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Who can tell what I m supposed to 
                    know these days...

      A tear runs down Marjorie Dawson s face...

                                  EDDIE
                    Why did you tell my colleague he 
                    was in danger?

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    He was asking questions.

                                  EDDIE
                    What kind of questions?

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Reckless questions. About reckless

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    You smell so strongly... 

                                  EDDIE
                    Pardon?

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    You smell of death.

      Outside, there s a screech of brakes. 

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    I think you had better leave now.

      Eddie looks down to see a police car. Two policemen leap out.

                                  EDDIE
                    Mrs. Dawson...

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Don t touch me! Don t hurt me! 
                    Please don t! Please don t!

      She cringes back, wailing like a tormented child. There s 
      Pounding and shouting up the stairs...

                                  EDDIE
                    I m not going to hurt you. Calm 
                    down...

      The pounding up the stairs is getting louder and louder. Mrs. 
      Dawson grabs hold of Eddie - hisses into his face.

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Tell them about the others...

                                  EDDIE
                    What?

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    The others!

                                  EDDIE
                    What others? What are you talking 
                    about?!

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Tell them. Please tell them where 
                    they are...

      Eddie turns to the window. Locked. Marjorie Dawson smiles 
      charmingly - once again the perfect trophy wife.

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Hello, you must be going...1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      47
                   


      The door slams open. The two policemen Eddie met earlier 
      burst in. Craven and Douglas. A truncheon whacks Eddie s 
      shins. He goes down. The Nurse Manager snarls from the door. 

                                  NURSE MANAGER
                    Lying bastard!

      Marjorie Dawson turns away in her bed - turns up Radio 3. 

                                  CRAVEN
                    You re dead, Little Fairy.

    A truncheon cracks Eddie s head. A hand grabs Eddie s hair. 
      He s dragged from the room. Marjorie Dawson and Mahler 
      rapidly recede. The door slams shut!



      Eddie. Dragged back down the stairs. Spine bouncing off each 
      stair. Hands flailing hands. Fingernails tearing...



      Blackness. Sounds of a hospital. 

      A big fat bandaged hand rises against the blurred image of 
      Eddie s mother. No watch. 

                                  EDDIE
                    What time is it?

                                    EDDIE S MOTHER
                    Just gone six, love.

      Eddie is on a hospital bed. He looks bad. His face is bruised 
      and cut. His mother is close to tears. 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      48
                   


                                    EDDIE S MOTHER
                    I found you in the car. In the back 
                    seat. Covered in blood. Just lying 
                    there...

                                  EDDIE
                    Mum. Please...

                                    EDDIE S MOTHER
                    I thought you were bloody dead!

      Eddie struggles to get up. 

                                    EDDIE S MOTHER
                    What are you doing?

                                  EDDIE
                    I ve got to go.

                                    EDDIE S MOTHER
                    Don t be daft. You re not fit.

      Eddie lurches to his feet. Sick, dizzy, in pain. 

                                    EDDIE S MOTHER
                    Don t do this to me! I hate you for 
                    this, Edward!

      Eddie takes her by the shoulders - brandishes his damaged 
      hand in her face.

                                  EDDIE
                    Mum, this is my work, right? I 
                    don t want you involved.



      Eddie throws his few belongings into a couple of bin liners - 
      his clothes, his files, three of his father s suits. He 
      carefully rolls up his three columns of information on the 
      missing girls...



      Eddie s mother has cried herself to sleep in her chair in 
      front of the TV. Eddie softly looks in on her. He kisses her 
      head. She stirs but doesn t wake. Eddie pads away. She 
      sleeps. 

      The sound of the door closing. She sleeps on.

      The sound of the Vauxhall Viva starting up and driving away. 

      She opens her eyes.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      49
                   


                                    EDDIE S MOTHER
                    Dad...?

      No one. Just the framed photograph of her dead husband.



      Eddie cruises down the Doncaster Road. He s on the look out. 
      Then he sees the sign in the night: It s the Only Place to 
      Stop!   The Redmoor Cafe and Motel. En-suite accommodation. 



      Eddie pulls up beside a lorry in the forecourt of the new, 
      long red brick building with pitched roof. 

      Eddie gets out. Looks around. Quiet. He pulls his black bin 
      liners out of the car and heads for the motel...  



      A NIGHT PORTER shows Eddie into a flimsy room overlooking the 
      carpark. A single bed, MFI wardrobe, damp curtains.

                                  NIGHT PORTER
                    Two quid a night. 

      Eddie dumps his bags. He counts out twenty eight pounds in 
      notes. The night porter shuffles away. 

      Eddie locks the door. Draws the curtains. Empties out his 
      sack of goodies: Clothes, a portable typewriter, files, 
      envelopes and research... 

      Eddie tears up strips of wallpaper. Makes three columns and 
      pins them to the wall. 

      Eddie labels the columns with a black marker:

                                SUSAN . JEANETTE . CLARE

      He pins up clippings for each girl. He tears Jack s name off 
      the Yorkshire Post article and chucks it. He pins the article 
      beneath Clare s name.

      Photos and newspaper cuttings. He adds the horrendous post-
      mortem photographs. 

      Eddie makes a new column in his growing collection of 
      material:

                                        JOHN DAWSON

      He pins up a snap of the destroyed gypsy camp. 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      50
                   


      Eddie picks up a photograph of Paula Garland...



      Eddie driving one handed. Bites the lid off a bottle of 
      Paracetamol - gobbles a few down. Every move hurts.



      Eddie eases painfully back into the white leather sofa. On 
      the mantle is a card of the Dawson house,  Shangrila , re-
      located to a snow-covered forest. A pastel sky, windows 
      filled with yellow firelight. Hyper real. Kitsch on 
      Quaaludes.

      Paula hands Eddie a Scotch. He knocks it back. Good stuff. He 
      is in a very dangerous mood. 

                                  PAULA
                    What happened to your hand?

                                  EDDIE
                    Two policemen slammed the car door 
                    on it.

                                  PAULA
                    Why? What for?

                                  EDDIE
                    Thought you might be able to tell 
                    me that. 

                                  PAULA

                    They were the same two coppers who 
                    warned me off last time I was here. 

      Paula s nervous. She gets herself a drink. Eddie watches her 
      body against the drinks cabinet lights.

                                  PAULA
                    I never said anything to the

                                  PAULA
                    I was upset. After you went... 
                    Well, John came over. John Dawson?

                                  EDDIE
                    John Dawson?... What did you say?

                                  PAULA
                    I told him some fucking journalist 
                    had been round asking questions. 
                    You pissed me off.

                                  EDDIE
                          (waving his bandaged paw)
                    There you go, then.

      Eddie painfully gets out of the chair. Goes towards Paula.

                                  EDDIE
                    Tell me about Dawson.

                                  PAULA
                    He s rich. And he was very kind to 
                    us when Jeanette went missing...

                    He s been very good to me.

      Eddie looks her up and down.

                    I ll bet.

                    What s that supposed to mean?

      Eddie holds his bandaged hand in her face.

                                  EDDIE
                    Think he d do something like this?

                    Clare Kemplay was found on a Dawson 
                      construction site.

                                  PAULA
                    You re talking nonsense. 

                                  EDDIE
                    I know all people like Dawson care 
                    about are their money and their 
                    little lies.

                                  PAULA
                    You don t know anything. You re 
                    just a boy.

      Paula pushes Eddie back. 

                                  EDDIE
                    I know there s some bastard out 
                    there who s taking and raping and 
                    murdering little girls and nobody 
                    is going to stop him because nobody 
                    really fucking cares! 

                                  PAULA
                    And you do? 

                                  EDDIE
                    I m some fucking journalist who 
                    asks questions, right. And I m 
                    going to keep asking them until I 
                    get the answers.

      Eddie lowers his hand, brushes lightly down her body. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Who else is going to do that for 
                    you?

      Paula kisses Eddie full on the mouth, his eyes, his ears.

                                  PAULA
                    Thank you. Thank you. Thank you...

      Eddie grabs at Paula, numb bandaged hand pawing at her skirt, 
      good hand pulling her against him. They fall to the sofa. 
      They pull at one another s clothes. 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      53
                   


      Desperate to get at each other s body. Every move hurts 
      Eddie. He doesn t care. No words.



      Eddie enters a magical hall lit by a roaring log fire... 

      In a four poster bed, Paula sleeps on her stomach. Satin 
      sheets up to her neck. Golden hair splayed... 

      Eddie pulls back the sheets to reveal... Paula has bloody 
      swan wings on her back... Eddie staggers away... 



      Eddie wakes in a silent house. He s alone - in Paula s double 
      bed. His wounds have blotted the sheets with blood.

      Daylight filters into a room that is very much Paula s. 
      There s a picture of Jeanette on her side of the bed... 



      Eddie emerges from Paula s room. There s a plastic door 
      plate:  Mummy and Daddy s Room . Opposite is a slightly ajar 
      door:  Jeanette s Room . He can hear a softly recited rhyme. 

                                  PAULA O/S
                    ...Two little dickie birds sitting 
                    on the wall...

      Eddie can see Paula - playing the child s game...

                                  PAULA
                    One called Peter and one called 
                    Paul. Fly away Peter. Fly away 
                    Paul...

      Eddie comes into the child s room. Untouched. Pink bedspread. 
      Teddies and dolls. Childish drawings. Photos on a corkboard. 
      Smiling Jeanette Garland. And Paula playing with her little 
      daughter who isn t there... 

                                  PAULA
                    Come back Peter. Come back Paul...

      She speaks without looking at Eddie.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      54
                   


                                  PAULA
                    When she was a baby, I d lie awake 
                    at night and wonder what I d do if 
                    anything happened to her; lying 
                    awake, seeing her dead. And I d run 
                    to her room and I d wake her up and 
                    I d hug her and hug her and hug 
                    her. And when she never came home, 
                    all those terrible things had come 
                    true...

      Eddie s arms go round her. He kisses away her tears. She 
      sinks into his arms. He rocks her gently.



      Flames burst up around a coffin. Everything turned to ash and 
      smoke. Just like Eddie s dad. 



      Eddie sits in the back of the Jag with John Dawson. Jason 
      King drives. DAWSON S DRIVER follows in Eddie s car. Down the 
      Bradford Road: black bricks, saris, BROWN BOYS playing 
      cricket in the cold. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    This nation s in fucking chaos with 
                    it s hung parliaments. A year ago 
                    they were going to bring back 
                      rationing. Now we got inflation at 
                    fucking 25 per cent! The country s 
                    at war, Mr. Dunford. 

      Everything run-down, closed, obsolete. John Dawson sighs at 
      it all - continues his running commentary on the world of 
      Yorkshire 1974 that drifts past.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    The government and the unions, the 
                    Left and the Right, the rich and 
                    the poor. Then you got your enemies 
                    within; your Paddys, your wogs, 
                    your niggers, your Gypos, the puffs 
                    and the perverts, even the bloody 
                    women. They re all out for what 
                    they can get. Soon there ll be nowt 
                    left for us lot. Time to turn the 
                    tide...

                                  EDDIE
                    Not a Labour man, then.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Course I bloody am! Tory cunts have 
                      out-priced themselves. Your Labour 
                    man will always do a deal. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Like the West Yorkshire Police...

      Eddie, playing poker. Dawson calling his bluff.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      56
                   


                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Trouble with your generation is you 
                    know nowt. You lot never fought a 
                    bloody war. I did my National 
                    Service protecting fat cunts like 
                    what I am now fighting the fucking 
                    Mau Maus! 

                                  EDDIE
                    I heard the stories. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Yeah? Well they re all true. 
                    Including the bit about cutting off 
                    cocks. It was Cowboys and Indians. 
                    Like now. 



      The red Jag followed by Eddie s Viva approaches a large 
      detached building. A sign over the former textile factory: 
      THE KARACHI SOCIAL CLUB. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Do you know the Karachi? It s a 
                    place where men can talk. A 
                      businessman like myself and an 
                    officer of the law can get together 
                    in a less formal setting so to 
                    speak. 

      They pull over opposite the Karachi Club with Eddie s car 
      behind. They get out. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    You going to continue our late 
                    friend s crusade against local 
                      corruption, Mr. Dunford?

                                  EDDIE
                    What makes you ask that?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Me and Barry had a very special 
                      relationship most of the time. 
                    Mutually beneficial it was.  

                                  EDDIE
                    In what way?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    I m in the fortunate position to be 
                    able to occasionally pass on 
                      information that comes my way. 
                    Certain officials sticking their

      Dawson shows him the label:  Dunford s .

                    Top man, your father. Knew how to 
                    cut his cloth. Solid. Dependable. 
                    Earned bugger all, mind... 

      Dawson puts his big mitt on Eddie s shoulder.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    That s not you, is it, Mr. Dunford? 
                    You re more like me. We like to 
                    fuck and make a buck and we re not 
                    right choosey how. Isn t that 
                    right? Drop by Saturday lunchtime. 
                    I got something might interest you.

      Dawson heads towards the Karachi Club with Jason King. He *
      pauses - turns back.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    And, Mr. Dunford? My wife is a very 
                    unwell woman. Speak to her again 
                    and it won t be your hand that gets 
                    smashed.

      The driver who took Eddie s car tosses the keys at him and 
      follows the big man and Jason King. Eddie is left with his *
      Viva.



      Eddie. Into the Press Club. The same smirking faces. The same 
      games. The same drinks. His is already on the bar before he

                      Metropolitan Police request that 
                    you be held in custody for a 
                    further eight days. Do you have any 
                      objection?

                                    MYSHKIN
                    No...

                                  COURT CLERK O/S
                    Do you wish reporting restrictions 
                    be lifted?

      Myshkin meets the eyes of the nearest detective. A slight 
      shake of his head.

                                  MYSHKIN*
                    No.*

                                  COURT CLERK O/S*
                    Michael John Myshkin, you will be *
                    remanded in custody for eight days. *
                    Reporting restrictions remain.*

      Myshkin raises his big paw of a hand like he s in school.*

                                  MYSHKIN*
                    Please? It wasn t me. It was the *
                    wolf... Under those beautiful *
                      carpets...*

      The detective pulls Myshkin away down the stairs. Myshkin *
      waves bye-bye as he descends. Eddie is in disbelief.*

                                  EDDIE*
                    What did he say? The wolf?*

      Eddie into Hadley s office. Jack Whitehead s got there first.

                    It s a bloody farce! Myshkin didn t

                    Thanks, Jack.

      Jack leaves. Eddie s eyes go to a card on Hadley s desk... 

                                  HADLEY
                    I don t want you coming to the 
                    office like this.

                                  EDDIE
                    Like what?

                                  HADLEY

      The card Eddie stares at is one of Dawson s house, 
      "Shangrila" in a snow-covered forest. Just like the one in 
      Eddie s nightmares. Just like the one at Paula s house.

                                  HADLEY
                    Edward, I d like you to take the 
                    rest of the month off. Get that 
                    hand seen to...

      Eddie picks up the "Shangrila" card. Opens it:  John & 
      Marjorie Dawson invite you to Shangrila. 

                                  HADLEY
                    Do you mind!

                                  EDDIE
                    How well do you know John Dawson? 

                                  HADLEY
                    I m sorry, Edward. Really I am. But 
                    I don t have the time for your 
                      adolescent conspiracy theories.

      Hadley snatches the card away from Eddie.


      OMITTED104104



      Eddie creeps through the trashed interior - smashed glass, 
      human excrement, a melted plastic Christmas tree. Water drips 
      through the ceiling...



      The toilet bowl and basin are smashed. More graffiti: Wogs 
      Out. Fuck the Provos. Eddie turns off the bath taps. Water 
      slops over the side. A dead cat protruding from a coal sack 
      floats in the brown water.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      66
                   


    A plastic plate reads: Michael s Room. Eddie enters the cell-
      like room. A smashed bed, torn curtains, a floor covered in 
      comics. Eddie pushes them with his foot: The Hulk, Kung-Fu... 
      a sketch book. He picks it up.

                              RAT MAN, PRINCE OR PEST?!  

        A child-like drawing of a crowned giant rat with human hands 
      and feet sitting on a throne. RAT MAN says:  Men are not our 
      judges. We judge men! 

                                  EDDIE
                    Christ... 

      Eddie turns the page to see: Rat Man flies on swan s wings.

                                  VOICE OFF
                    Pervert!

      Eddie spins round. Nearly has a heart attack. TWO SNOTTY BOYS 
      crowd the doorway. One has a hammer. Eddie recovers.

                                  EDDIE
                    What are you doing?

                    We can do what we want, then.

                                  EDDIE
                    You know Michael Myshkin, do you?

                                  BOY 1
                    He s a pervert.

                                  EDDIE
                    Where s the family?

                                  BOY 1
                    Pissed off.

                                  BOY 2
                    His dad was on Sick because of 
                    dust.

                                  BOY 1
                    His dad was a sp-sp-sp-spastic!

      They laugh.

      Eddie pockets the comic, heads for the doorway - tries to 
      distract the brats. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Dead cat in there.

                                  BOY 2
                    Yeah. We killed it.

      Eddie has to push past them. 



      Paula opens the door to Eddie. Pale-faced, on the edge, red 
      cardigan pulled tight round her.

                                  PAULA
                    Where ve you been? 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      69
                   


                                  EDDIE
                    Can I come in?

                                  PAULA
                    Did you see Myshkin? What did he *
                    look like?

                                  EDDIE
                    Shut the door, love. It s cold.



      Top of the Pops. Eddie Holman sings  (Hey There) Lonely 
      Girl . Paula stares at Jeanette s photo.

                                  PAULA
                    She s dead, isn t she...

      Eddie lights up, passes it to Paula. He puts his arms round 
      her. Kisses her eyes closed. A new number. Barry White. Eddie 
      and Paula sway together to the breathy music... They look at 
      one another and realise they ve fallen for the Sultan of 
      Smooth Soul. Laughter through tears. A moment together.

                                  EDDIE
                    They ve got sunshine down South, 
                    seaview flats, warm summer breezes. 
                    We could go there now. Never come 
                    back...



      Paula and Eddie. Clothes drawn off. Clothes draped over a 
      chair. In one another s arms. Tears. Embracing. Falling 
      apart. Embracing again. Making and re-making knots...

      Eddie and Paula. Fitfully sleeping and waking. Unused to one 
      another. Moving in their sleep. Dreaming. Haunted...

      Eddie turns over. He s alone. Paula has melted away into the 
      darkness. Her clothes are gone from the chair... He listens 
      to her moving through the house...



      Paula slips into her coat, then quietly heads out the front 
      door... Eddie comes down the stairs, still pulling on his 
      shirt... The front door closes after Paula...



      An empty bottle. Eddie is in a deep drunken sleep. The room 
      is trashed.

      Sounds of trucks outside the motel. Lights travel across the 
      dingy room and across his shrine - the photos of 
       Shangrila ... 

      The drawing of the golden crowned Rat Man on a throne is 
      pinned to the wall. Rat Man dominates Eddie s shrine to his 
      investigation; the columns and lists and photographs.  

                                RAT MAN, PRINCE OR PEST?
                      Men are not our judges. We judge men!



      Eddie parks up outside: THE KARACHI SOCIAL CLUB. He gets out - 
      heads for the restaurant and club.



      Eddie comes through the vast red restaurant. Dark, hot 
      colours. Heavy Indian drapes. Hindu gods. White tablecloths. 
      Heavy silver. Indian muzak. Empty. WAITERS IN WHITE COLONIAL 
      UNIFORMS lay out dishes. A FLUNKY comes to Eddie.

                                  EDDIE
                    I m here to see Mr. John Dawson.

                                  FLUNKY
                    Mr. Dawson. One second, sir.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      71
                   


      The flunky aims Eddie at the bar where the barmaid - CLARE 
      STRACHAN - cleans glasses. 

      Eddie watches the flunky go down the far end to a cordoned 
      VIP area. John Dawson and Jason King Moustache sit at a *
      table. The flunky speaks to Dawson.

                                  CLARE
                    What s it to be, hen?

                                  EDDIE
                    On the big man, is it?

      Dawson approaches Eddie, grinning.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    It s all right, Clare, he s with 
                    me... Same again, love.

      Clare drops her cheery smile. Does as she s told. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                          (to Eddie)
                    You look like shit.

                                  EDDIE
                    Up all night. What s your excuse?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    I ve got my weaknesses, lad. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Paula Garland one of them?

      A second... Then the big man laughs, puts an arm round Eddie 
      and guides him away... 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Me and Paula go back a long way. 
                    Old friends.

      Three pints are brought on a silver tray. Eddie, John Dawson 
      and Jason King are seated round the table in the snug. Jason *
      lights Eddie s cigarette.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    I like this place. It s private. 
                    Just the wogs and us. That s how I 
                    like things. Private. Cheers.

      The waiter arrives with the food.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Another round, Sammy. And bring 
                    over the pud trolley. I want to 
                    show Mr. Dunford some delights.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      72
                   


      John Dawson upends his deep red sauce over yellow rice. He 
      and Jason King start shovelling it in. *

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Get stuck in, lad. We don t stand 
                    on ceremony here. Hope you like 
                    your curry hot.

                                  EDDIE
                    I only had it once before.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Let me pile a load of this on for 
                    you. 

      John Dawson loads pickles and yoghurt on a popadum and shoves 
      it at Eddie. Eddie tentatively tries some. Too hot for him. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    If you don t mind me asking, what 
                    are you working on at the moment?

                                  EDDIE
                    The Clare Kemplay murder.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Bloody appalling. There aren t 
                    words, are there. They got the 
                    cunt, didn t they?

                                  EDDIE
                    Looks like it, yeah.

      The pints arrive. A waiter pushes a dessert trolley draped 
      with a sheet.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Here we go. I think you know we ve 
                    got an important investment over at 
                    Hunslet Carr... Feast your eyes.

      Dawson pulls off the sheet to reveal a perfect little 
      architect s model of the proposed shopping centre. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Look it s got little trees and 
                      everything. What your Yanks call a 
                    shopping mall. You got your high 
                    street chains, your cinema, bowling 
                    alley, caffs, restaurant, all under 
                    one roof. Put a hotel in there and 
                    there s no need to fuck off home.

                                  EDDIE
                    So what s the problem?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    I ve got investors to look after, 
                    haven t I.  

                                  EDDIE
                    Bill Molloy one of them?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Don t be a cunt. Course Bill 
                    Molloy s one of them. Not the only 
                    copper neither... Give it to him, 
                    Paul.

      Jason King pushes an A4 envelope across the rapidly staining *
      tablecloth to Eddie. Dawson keeps shovelling food.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Open it.

      Eddie deliberates. It s the same size and colour as the 
      envelope that contained Clare Kemplay s post-mortem...

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Take a fucking look, lad.

      A breath. Eddie pulls out large black and white photos.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                      I apologise for the vile content of 
                    these snaps, Mr. Dunford. I hear 
                    you re a bit of a cunt man. 

      The photos: Glimpses of two men in flagrante. One is BJ. The 
      other is a older, greying man. John Dawson and Jason King *
      continue to stuff themselves.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Sticks in the craw, doesn t it? I 
                    mean, how can they do it?

                                  EDDIE
                    Who is it?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Who is it?! Bloody hell. How the 
                    mighty have fallen. That s 
                      Councillor William Shaw, that is;

                    Labour Party. That s your Man Most

      John Dawson pulls out a cigar. Jason lights it.*1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      74

      Cuts deep. A still moment.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Come on, Eddie, I need a little 
                      cooperation. You play your part, 
                    son, and we ll all get what we

                    Like Barry.

                                  EDDIE
                    Barry s dead, isn t he! 

      Eddie s on his feet. Dawson leans across - his hand goes to 
      Eddie s balls. He squeezes. Clare watches from the bar.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                      I respected Barry. He was a good 
                    man. His problem was he had his own 
                    agenda...  

                                  EDDIE
                    That why you had him killed?

      Dawson laughs at that one. He squeezes. Eddie yelps.

      Eddie in the fast lane. Putting distance between him and 
      Dawson. Radio full up:  Tubular Bells . The Castleford 
      turning looms out of the murky day. Eddie swerves across 
      three lanes of traffic. Horns blare. 



      Robot aliens are eating instant mashed potato on the TV. 
      Eddie s slumped on the sofa, half-cut, watching Paula fix a 
      drink.

      He hangs up. *



      Eddie cruises up the dark, leafy lane. He rounds a bend. 
      Glimmering lights loom ahead. 



      Eddie comes through into the golden light. Last time he was 
      here was in a dream. This is real. Bow ties. Long dresses. 
      Frilled shirts. Cigars and whiskies. He keeps going - headed 
      for the back room and the noise.



      Eddie enters the lounge. The music is up. RED-FACED MEN and 
      WOMEN with too much slap crowd down the far end. Eddie 
      recognises his editor, Bill Hadley talking to Bill Molloy. He 
      almost laughs.

                                  EDDIE
                    Hello, Mr. Hadley. Looking after 
                    the Yorkshire Post s special 
                      relationship are we? 

      Molloy nods to HEAVIES. Hard men head for Eddie. 

      Eddie keeps going. Garden torches flare in the garden beyond 
      the tall windows. Seated beneath them like the White Queen is 
      Marjorie Dawson. 

      Beside her is Martin Laws with BJ in a suit - flares and 
      lapels you d cut your fingers on. He meets Eddie s look, 
      shakes his head at him. 

      John Dawson pushes his way through, flanked by Jason King. He *
      embraces Eddie.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Eddie, lad. There are people here 
                    want to talk to you, son...1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      80
                   


                                  EDDIE
                    I want to see Paula. I m not 
                      interested in your filthy little 
                    world. I came for Paula. 
                          (shouting)
                    Paula! Paula!

      Jason King collars Eddie. He meets Dawson s nasty smile.*

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    She s long gone, son... But you 
                    know that, don t you...

                                  EDDIE
                    Where is she?!

      Eddie punches and kicks his way out of Jason King s grasp. He *
      blunders through the panicking crowd. ANOTHER MAN floors him. 
      He crashes to the ground. Finds himself at Marjorie Dawson s 
      feet. She bends to him - trembling - mad...

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Please tell them about the

                    grows between the cracks...

      The same words Myshkin used. Before Eddie can respond, he s 
      yanked away by his hair.

                                  HENCHMAN
                    Outside.

      Fireworks explode outside. The party crowd rush to the 
      windows to see the dispaly.

      Eddie is dragged away from Marjorie Dawson by the heavies. 

      Marjorie watches, trembling, from the doorway. 



      Flash photographs are taken of Eddie.

      His bandages are cut off his hand. His nails are scraped.

      More flash photographs.

    A torch is shone in Eddie s eye. His mouth is wiped with a 
      spatula.



      Alderman and Prentice aim a firehose at Eddie handcuffed to a 
      chair. The freezing water pins him to the floor.

      The door slams shut. Locks. Eddie, left panting on the floor, 
      still handcuffed. Silence. He lies, shivering in a pool of 
      water. The bright lights hum. The sound of a dog barking and 
      screams from a nearby room. The eye at the spy-hole watches 
      Eddie.

                                  EDDIE
                    What do you want?! Tell me what you 
                    want!

      Silence. Eddie, shivering on the floor, still handcuffed. 

      The door opens. Old friends enter. The Two Bobs. Craven and 
      Douglas. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Oh, fuck. No.

      Craven unlocks the cuffs - throws them to Douglas who puts a 
      blanket over Eddie s shoulders.

      Eddie does as he s told. His right hand is a mess. Douglas 
      paces behind him. Craven sits opposite. Suddenly Craven 
      brings the cuffs down on Eddie s poor hand. He screams.

      Douglas offers Craven a cigarette. They light up. 

                                  EDDIE
                    What do you want?

      Douglas dangles his cigarette over Eddie s hand. 

                                  EDDIE
                    What do you want?

      Douglas mashes out his cigarette on Eddie s hand. 

                                  CRAVEN
                    Put your hands back.

      Whimpering, Eddie does as he s told. Craven offers Douglas 
      another cigarette. He lights up. Eddie stands up.

                                  EDDIE
                    Just tell me what you want!

                                  CRAVEN
                    Sit down.

      Eddie sits. Douglas and Craven stand.

                                    DOUGLAS
                    Stand up.

      They move the chairs and table to the walls. 

                                    DOUGLAS
                    Don t move!

      They leave the room. Eddie stands there, hands over his 
      genitals. Screams and barking come from an adjoining room. He 
      stays where he was told. Shivering. Afraid. Alone...

      SOME TIME LATER:

      Eddie is curled naked in a corner. The door slams open. 
      Craven and Douglas return. Eddie staggers to his feet.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      83
                   


                                  EDDIE
                    Please tell me what you want.

      Craven kicks Eddie in the crotch. He goes down. Douglas cuffs 
      his hands behind him. Tape goes over his mouth. A black hood 
      goes over his head.



      Hooded, Eddie is dragged and kicked down the corridor by 
      Craven and Douglas.



      The hood is pulled from Eddie s head. He s reeling. Blinded 
      by the strip lighting. Mouth taped up. Craven and Douglas 
      hold him. Bill Molloy stands in front of a medical trolley 
      covered with a green sheet. Molloy grabs the sheet and pulls 
      it back to reveal...

      Eddie tries to scream through the tape. His eyes start from 
      their sockets. Blood thumps into his head...

      Lying on the autopsy trolley is the body of Paula Garland. 

      Eddie s legs give way. He s screaming and vomiting behind the 
      gag. Craven and Douglas keep him upright.

                                  MOLLOY
                    Look at her! Look at her!

      Molloy drags Eddie s face close to the corpse s. Eddie s 
      choking and writhing. Craven pulls off the tape.

      Molloy pauses. He looks up. Standing in the door is the 
      owlish Maurice Jobson. He is very solemn. He gives his head a 
      slight shake at Molloy... 

                                  MOLLOY
                    Stay with him.

      Molloy crosses to Jobson. They go outside. The door shuts us 
      out... 

      But the little viewing window is open. We can see the two men 
      arguing. But we can t hear what they re saying... Jobson is 
      pleading, arguing a case. Molloy is tight lipped... Then 
      Molloy appears to be deliberating... 

      Eddie. On the floor. Rock bottom.  Craven and Douglas 
      standing over him.

                    You loved her...

      Molloy gestures to Craven and Douglas. They stand back. 
      Watching the show. Molloy turns Eddie s face up to his.

                                  MOLLOY

    A black sack is pulled off Eddie s head. He s kneeling at the 
      open back doors of the van. Craven and Douglas hold him. The 
      van tears down the country road. Craven takes out a Smith and *

      Craven checks the gun. He points it at Eddie s head again. 
      Eddie pisses himself. There s a huge explosion. Eddie opens 
      his eyes. It was a blank. Craven and Douglas guffaw. Then 
      Craven gives him a big hug.

      Eddie enters the hall. The house is empty, silent but for the 
      doleful sound of Mahler s Kindertotenlieder:  Now I can see 
      why such dark flames / You flashed at me...  Eddie follows 
      the sound - away from the lounge where the party was - into 
      the other wing...



      Eddie follows the music through double doors into a vast 
      studio. Two life-size bronze casts of flapping swans flank 
      the fireplace. An enormous photograph of a swan taking off 
      from a black lake hangs above. Swans are everywhere - glass 
      ornaments, china ornaments, stuffed swans are arranged on 
      every surface.

                    Shut up, you stupid bitch!*

      Blam! Eddie shoots Dawson in the legs. He topples over. *
      Laughing. Eddie stands over him with the gun.*

      Eddie pulls the trigger. Blam! Dawson screams.*

      Blam! Air and blood hissing out Dawson s chest. *

      Blam! Blood splashes. *

      And he s out of there. Behind him - everyone in shock. *
      Cordite smoke. Blood. Blaring rock.

      BJ sways... Then he moves fast - rifles through the bar till. 
      Clare Strachan whimpers. BJ pulls her with him. 

                                  BJ
                    Got to get out of here, Clare, 
                    love. Time to go.

      Sound of sirens and screeching cars. BJ drags Clare down 
      behind the bar. 


      OMITTED161161



      Eddie drives fast. Headed South. 

                                  EDDIE
                    There s sunshine down South, sea-
                    view flats and warm summer 
                      breezes... 

      Paula is beside him. Beautiful, blonde, hard. 

      Faster. Blue police lights in the rear view mirror. 

      Paula, laughing. They re escaping. 

      Faster. Wailing sirens. Faster. Flashing lights. Faster...

      Paula kisses Eddie s face. 

      Eddie spins the car round. Police cars heads straight for 
      him. He puts his foot down. Straight into the blazing lights.

      Blackness.



      Down down down a disused mine shaft. Damp brick sides. 
      Ghostly light. Dripping water. Girders and beams...

      Down down down. Davey lamps illuminate a grotto. Mirrors line 
      one wall. The tunnel has been bricked up. The bricks are 
      painted blue with white clouds. 

                                  MRS. DAWSON V/O
                    ...The others beneath those 
                    beautiful new carpets...

      In front of the wall is a gold painted throne. The floor is 
      covered with sacking and white feathers... And Polaroids: 
      Glimpses of little hands covering faces. Limbs. Stitching. 
      Tools. Blood. Adult smiles...

      One particular photograph: A naked man sitting on the gold 
      throne against the painted blue sky and clouds. A naked man 
      wearing a paper crown. King Rat. John Dawson.

                                  MRS. DAWSON V/O
                    He does for John... The wolf does 
                    whatever John wants... The wolf...

      A silhouetted figure looms over the photographs. A hand picks 
      up the Polaroid of Dawson. Puts it into a candle flame. 
      Dawson goes to hell.



                                              END
