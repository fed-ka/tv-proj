The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in
one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly
lit in
the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies, swaddled and
coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the baby's every need.
Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter.
19		OUT
19X1		LOGAN
Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace.
He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery
window
into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS. Logan is
KNOCKING on the soundless glass.
LOGAN
Wake up...come on, Logan-6.
19X2		FRANCIS
entering .
FRANCIS
(shaking
his head in
mild, mocking
disbelief)
You are here. I
couldn't
believe it when they told me.
What are you doing?
LOGAN (still knocking
on the soundless glass)
Turn this way.
(as one of the infants
stirs, smiles, bubbles)
No,
no...not you...YOU!
Francis tries to pull Logan away from the
window, but Logan is
intent on waking one of
the infants.
FRANCIS
You should've seen me take my
last Runner...perfect.
(Logan
continues to pound the
soundless glass)
I backed him
up against a residence
pool and
when he terminated...his
hand...
(breaks off as Logan
is paying
no attention)
So now you've seen him...what's
the difference awake or asleep?
LOGAN (to infant)
Open your eyes once, idiot.
(to Francis)
It's not every
day that a Sandman
son is
born. I'm telling you,
Francis
- that's him!
FRANCIS
Maybe,
maybe not. What's the
difference? Come on,
Logan,
let's get out of
here before
everybody
finds out.
But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an
idea.
FRANCIS
Okay...you really want to wake
him up?
Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it
will sound an
ALARM.
LOGAN
Hey, cut that out !
Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they
stand
is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and
stops him from
prying at the panel:
LOGAN
Now you've done it...
The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:
VOICE
Break-in scanners report intrusion,
identify.
LOGAN
Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty
quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
VOICE
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
The violet light goes off.
FRANCIS (with affection:
to Logan)
Had enough?
LOGAN (looking at the infant)
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
As Francis starts out:
LOGAN (one last look;
joining Francis)
All right, Francis...I'm with you.
They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING as
they
pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN
automatically
tended.
CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.
VOICE
Sleep time...go to sleep.
Sleeping time, little ones.
As they exit Nursery...Logan stops and takes one final look
backward.
FRANCIS
You need a lift. Let's go
to Arcade and celebrate...
(teasing tone)
your alert successor...Logan-6.
LOGAN
Has anyone ever broken in to
where the babies are?
FRANCIS
(putting a card key into a door
which opens soundlessly)
Not in my time...
They move through the door which closes.
The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.
They
move off.
As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor.
LOGAN
I just might look in on New You 483
myself.
FRANCIS
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
LOGAN
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone
in 483 was trying to help him.
As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen,
who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One
of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them
SANDMAN (Monitor)
What's with you, Francis?
FRANCIS (touching his
head; grimacing)
Last night
The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis
continue to:
65-68	OUT
Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth
room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,
YELLOW GREEN AND RED.
Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the
city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to
the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.
There are no humans.
Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....
above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table.
Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film.)
The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner
on the overhang above.
Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of
fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times.
He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments
later...the scanner stops...the word:
|
IDENTIFY
appears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . .
and the words:
CLEAR
FRANCIS-7
appear on the SCREEN.
FRANCIS
See you in the hydrotoner!
Logan nods.
Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the
items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among
them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.
Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the
items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was
earlier.
The scanner continues scanning.
Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on
and on.
Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything
remotely resembling this length of time.
Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word:
PROBABILITY
blinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As
Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word
PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word:
APPROACH
We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . .
that he has never seen this before.
Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a
stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm
crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair.
The word on the SCREEN is now:
IDENTIFY
Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove.
We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears
on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words
appear on the SCREEN:
OBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOM
PATTERN AND FREQUENCY. LINKED
WITH OBSOLETE WORD: SANCTUARY.
PROBABLE EXISTENCE ESTABLISHED.
QUESTION: IDENTIFY OBJECT?
LOGAN
Negative. Question: What is it?
Words on SCREEN now read:
PREMILLENNIAL SYMBOL.
NAME: ANKH. QUESTION:
IDENTIFY CONCEPT SANCTUARY?
LOGAN
Negative.
Words on SCREEN now read:
SANCTUARY: CODE WORD PREMILL-
ENNIAL RELIGIONS DENOTING
PLACE OF IMMUNITY.
LOGAN
I don't understand?
Words on SCREEN now read:
SANCTUARY NOW MATHEMATICALLY
RELATED TO UNACCOUNTED
CITIZENS NUMBERING 1056.
LOGAN
Question:
Word on SCREEN now reads:
HOLD
It disappears and words on SCREEN now read:

CONCLUSION SANCTUARY EXISTENT....
RUNNER GOAL.
LOGAN
1056 unaccounted for?!
Word on SCREEN reads:

LOGAN
Impossible!
(Rising tone)
Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners.
Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal
on Carousel.
Words on SCREEN read:
NEGATIVE...UNACCOUNTED

LOGAN
Question: None of them reached renewal?
Word on SCREEN reads:
ZERO
LOGAN
But everyone believes that some....
Words on SCREEN read:

LOGAN
Question: You mean nobody's ever
been renewed?
Words on SCREEN read:

ZERO....ECOLOGICAL-NEGATIVE...
As Logan reacts the new words which appear read:
AUTHORIZATION TO
PENETRATE CITY SEALS...
LOGAN (startled)
The Seal......
(Breaks off)
Question: The Seals? Go outside?!
But there's nothing outside!
The words on the SCREEN read:
SANCTUARY DESTRUCT...
FIND
DESTROY
LOGAN
I will.
The words on the SCREEN read:
ASSIGNMENT SECRET.
LOGAN
Question:
(a beat)
What if I need help from another
Sandman?
The words on the SCREEN read:
NEGATIVE. REPEAT: ASSIGNMENT
SECRET. LOGAN-5 TRANSFER TO
RUNNER SEEKING SANCTUARY.
Logan takes a breath.
LOGAN
Question: I am six Red...how can
I pretend to be approaching Lastday?
The words on the SCREEN read:
LIFECLOCK--ALTER
LOGAN
My Lifeclock...
(slightest beat)
Question: My Life--
Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain and
his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it
wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.
Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to
glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced
to close his eyes.
As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower
crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated,
fearful.
LOGAN
Question:
(urgent tone)
Am I still six Red?
The words on the SCREEN read:
LIFECLOCK-ALTER
LOGAN (standing)
I know that but I had four more years
(extending the blinking palm)
This means ten days to Lastday.
Of course I will get the four years
back, won't I?
The words on the SCREEN read:
TAKE OBJECT WITH YOU
LOGAN (very urgent)
Question: Do I get my four years back?
Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if to
say something more but he changes his mind, turns away.
Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almost
automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but the
SCREEN already has the words:
CLEAR LOGAN-5
Logan looks at it - then:
The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANT
LIFECLOCKS....where he pauses.... glances at his BLINKING
CRYSTAL....and continues out into:
Spectacularly 23rd century. Logan enters. He looks around and spots
Francis.... in a whirlpool bath....trying to recover from has
incredible hangover.
In the b.g. of the SHOT we can see some Sandmen doing calisthenics.
Logan walks over to Francis....hiding his blinking crystal by
holding his hand against his leg.
FRANCIS
What the hell took you so long?
LOGAN
(after a beat)
Did you ever see anybody renew?
FRANCIS
I think you've been skulling out too
much. First Nursery and now stupid
questions.
LOGAN
Did you?
FRANCIS
Of course.
LOGAN
Anybody we know?
FRANCIS
Look....why don't you get into the
water....you need it....more than I do.
LOGAN
(after a beat)
I'm fine....
(walking away)
See you....
FRANCIS
At Carousel tonight?
Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS
for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:
Logan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN who
has obviously escorted her there.
YOUNG SANDMAN (smiling)
She says she's been here before...
LOGAN
She has.
Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile
widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.
JESSICA
You could have called me yourself.
LOGAN
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
JESSICA
(the game has started)
Here I am.
(beat)
Shall I come in?
Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area.
LOGAN
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
JESSICA
I'm the most beautiful woman you've
ever seen, I suppose?
LOGAN
Maybe...sure....
JESSICA
Thanks...but I have the choice.
LOGAN
Of course.
JESSICA
Then it's still no.
Logan laughs.
JESSICA
You can have any woman in the city.
What do you really want?
LOGAN
You know
JESSICA
I don't believe you. There has to
be more.
LOGAN
All right.
Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that.
Jessica can see it blinking red.
Jessica gasps for a moment...then:
JESSICA
Why show me?
LOGAN
I'm going to run.
JESSICA (after
reacting)
Why tell me?
LOGAN
You know something.
JESSICA
About running, dying what?
LOGAN
Both...running's what I'm interested
in.
JESSICA
I know what everyone knows. Try
like hell for Renewal. You have
the same chance everyone else has.
LOGAN
It's different now. Help me.
JESSICA
How can I?
Logan takes out the ankh.
JESSICA
Where did you get that?
LOGAN
A Runner gave it to me.
JESSICA
And then you killed him, right?
LOGAN
I let him go...believe me.
JESSICA
I don't..
LOGAN (a beat)
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica...
please...
JESSICA
Please? What friends?
LOGAN
(clutching the ankh, looking
at Jessica's; then:)
I don't have much time.
JESSICA
I never heard of a Sandman running
. . . ever. . .
LOGAN (putting the
ankh in his pocket;
dropping the bombshell)
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't..
Logan reaches out and touches her hand.
LOGAN
What can I do to make you believe me?
Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch.
Logan stands and starts out...as Jessica watches him..
74-81	OUT
A room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor,
also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates an
absolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatingly
across the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarily
certain she's about to smash into something.
LOGAN (guiding her)
Just follow--no matter how it seems...
JESSICA (doing her
best)
But what is this--why?
LOGAN (as they enter
the corridor)
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle
there's
no way to catch up. Without the
dazzle, they'd just go past us--
(gesture)
too fast
JESSICA
Muscle? I don't know that one.
Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. It's stop and go--a
fun house in which you can get hurt.
LOGAN
It's unauthorized. No good for any-
one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you
to pieces--speeds everything up to a
blur--
(he is amused)
you can see what happens when some
flying Cub tries to go through this
on muscle--splat!
Jessica reacts...to what Logan has said...then:
A moment later:
124		ANOTHER ANGLE
As they approach the end of the corridor, a small FIGURE in a
tattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she sees
Logan and Jessica.
JESSICA (gently)
Don't be afraid.
We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair
is tangled.
JESSICA
What's your name?
MARY
I'm Mary 2.
JESSICA
Where do you live, Mary?
MARY
Here.
JESSICA
Why aren't you in Nursery?
MARY
I'm very smart.
JESSICA
When do you go up?
MARY
I never go upstairs. You're a
nice old lady.
As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's
clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away
swiftly.
As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back.
LOGAN
(shaking his head)
Not here. Might be a decoy.
Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-
JESSICA
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you
to be killed.
LOGAN
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take
me there?
JESSICA
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is.
But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
LOGAN (a beat)
All right. But why? I didn't kill the
Runner.
JESSICA (interrupting)
Yes, but they won't know that...or care.
They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too,
now...
LOGAN (wry laugh)
That's nothing...there's a Sandman
behind us, too and there'll be
more soon. Take me to them.
JESSICA (torn)
I - I can't.
LOGAN
Then - why don't you leave me - go
to them - explain
JESSICA
No. Not that either.
Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then:
LOGAN
All right. New You 483. I'll find
out myself.
Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring
the city.
139X2		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS
Walking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area.
The scanners begin moving.
Moments later the scanner stops...the word:
IDENTIFY
appears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into
the groove.
Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them
on the scanning table.
An ALARM SOUNDS and the word:
REJECT
flashes on and off on the SCREEN.
Sandmen come running into the Area.
SANDMAN
What happened?!
Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind,
taking the items off the table:
FRANCIS
Can you beat it....I've got the damn
wrong bag.
SANDMAN
You ought to put yourself on reliefcall,
Francis.
FRANCIS (starting out)
Yeah....
The waiting room has many mirrors...where customers ...male and
female...are checking their faces (and bodies).
There are also various photographs on the walls... suggestions for
changes to foreheads, eyes, cheeks, lips, etcetera. The chatty
informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber
shop.
There is a RECEPTIONIST seated behind a desk in a corner.
Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk.
The receptionist looks at Logan...ignoring Jessica.
RECEPTIONIST
Hello, Sandman.
LOGAN
Hello.
RECEPTIONIST
Do you want to see Doc?
Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching.
RECEPTIONIST
We don't get many Sandmen. I think
we've only had one other since I've
been here.
LOGAN (brusquely)
A Sandman can get as sick of his face
as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
RECEPTIONIST (smiling)
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc
took a picture? I'd Like him to give
your face to somebody else.
LOGAN
It's all right with me. Is he here?
RECEPTIONIST
My name's Holly...Holly 13. In
ancient times they said my number
was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
LOGAN
No - Look, I'm in a hurry.
HOLLY
Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman.
Logan and Jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and
sit down next to an attractive WOMAN.
WOMAN CUSTOMER
Is this your first time?
Logan and Jessica nod.
WOMAN CUSTOMER (smiling)
This is my third...
(a beat)
... I did it when I turned yellow ...
and green.
(showing her palm)
I turned red yesterday.
LOGAN (looking)
Beautiful work. This man do them all?
WOMAN CUSTOMER
No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you
seen any of his work?
LOGAN
Just one.
HOLLY
Doc's ready, Sandman.
Logan and Jessica stand. They follow Holly into a large, shining,
stainless steel room where we see:
143		MED. ANGLE - DOC
who looks about twenty-one years old, exchanges a pointed look with
Jessica.
DOC
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
LOGAN
Thanks.
(slightest beat)
I thought you'd be older. I ex-
pected a Red.
DOC (showing his palm;
the flower crystal is Red)
I am.
LOGAN
Your own work?
DOC (with pride)
And I did it myself right on there.
144		FULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUS
Aesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded
in the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.
The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an
equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.
At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of
switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the
operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing
vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician
demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole
apparatus subsides.
DOC
I designed it myself.
(slightest beat)
What'll it be ...a face job or
a full-body job?
LOGAN
Just the face.
DOC
Fine....Holly will get you ready.
You're in good hands, believe me.
Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic.
As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms:
DOC
Holly works here because she gets a
lift out of watching the Table...
(smiles)
and other things. I'll be back in a
minute.
HOLLY
He's going to sterilize himself.
LOGAN
Do I have to undress?
HOLLY
Not for your face.
Logan follows Holly to the Table. (Jessica remains behind with Doc
who speaks to her with soft urgency).
DOC
You shouldn't have brought him here.
JESSICA;
I didn't bring him -- what's
the difference. He's blinking.
He wants to run.
DOC
Run!? He's a Sandman.
JESSICA
I tell you he's running. I know.
DOC
Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd
gone somewhere else.
(a beat, a shrug)
All right. He gets a face.
144X1		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLY
Logan lies down.
The Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning
him.
HOLLY
(leaning - close to
Logan)
I like dark hair. Have him give you
dark hair.
DOC'S VOICE
All set?
HOLLY
Um huh. Would you take a picture
of him, Doc? I'd like you to give
his face to somebody else.
DOC
Why not?
Doc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH.
DOC
Do you have anything special in mind?
LOGAN
I don't care...Just get it over
with.
DOC (smiling)
Hurry...hurry...hurry.
HOLLY (whispering)
Dark hair.
LOGAN
Holly'd like dark hair.
DOC
Holly'd like a lot of things.
(studying Logan's face)
We can start by narrowing the
cheekbones.
Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standing
next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a
pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster
and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.
CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces
and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.
A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.
SOUND: An insistent chiming.
Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's
been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like
apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The
table and the laser heads stop moving.
DOC
(as if speaking on a phone)
Hello
(listening)
Yes
(listening)
Yes, they are.
(listening; his expression
changing)
Done.
Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan,
then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look
registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine
again...
DOC
Pay attention, Sandman. I'm
proud of this machine.
As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position
near Logan's face. It pauses as
DOC
With this one there's no waiting
for scar burnishing. It's all in
one...watch now...
The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a
bright trail of blood as
DOC
But here's the improvement. Instant
healing---before you feel a thing.
Watch now...
Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,
spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is
moist and whole.
144X2		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN
His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright
face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's
happening.
144X3		BACK TO DOC
who is playing the console as he speaks.
DOC
Perfect depth adjustment on this
one, Sandman. The beam will cut
through that uniform and just
exactly through the skin beneath--
absolute precision. Watch now
And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a
seam of blood following the rip.
DOC
Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms,
Sandman, but otherwise it does
everything, doesn't it? Just
imagine what would happen to you
if the healing stopped functioning.
And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into
Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears.
Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch
and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly
and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed.
HOLLY
No! You're scrambling the table.
He'll be cut to pieces, Doc.
DOC
Damn right! It was a trap. They
know!
LOGAN
No - I'm Running!
Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY.
Jessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle with
her as:
145-145X4		INTERCUT: CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN
Moving.
HOLLY
Watching two stun beams lower.
Doc knocks Jessica down. She is groggy on the floor as
The stun beams lance into Logan's cheeks.
The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee.
146-148		QUICK CUTS OF DOC AND HOLLY
Watching intently as:
149-150		CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM
As surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist
leaving two threads of blood.
A vacu-head dips to suck the blood
away neatly.
151		ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN
As Logan desperately sucks in his belly....trying to flatten himself
into the Table.
152-153	CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM
As laser blades cut into his face....followed by a spray of healing
liquid on the cuts.
154		CLOSE - ON HOLLY
Excited....flushed....as:
155		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM
As two wide blades of light sweep downward....and hover three inches
above his neck....and keep lowering ....HUMMING loudly....and one
inadvertently frees Logan's right arm.
156		CLOSE ON - DOC
Shocked as Logan reaches for his gun.
157		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM.
As dozens of laser beams slash toward Logan....he twists away....and
breaks off....jumping off the Table.
Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy.
In an instant he has knocked Logan's gun away....and as Logan looks
down at it....we see it lying on the floor completely frozen.
Slowly, Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stick
menacing in his hand.
LOGAN (out-of-breath)
What I told you is the....
Abruptly, Doc lunges toward Logan...missing him as Logan ducks away.
As Doc turns to attack....Logan smashes his elbows into Doc's chest
and Doc falls back onto the Table.
157X1	CLOSE ON - HOLLY
SCREAMING, as Doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparks
and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out and
various fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces. Holly tries to
fight her way into the mess to help Doc, but Jessica, recovering,
pulls her down and the two struggle.
157X2	CLOSE ON - DOC
In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.
157X3	LOGAN
Making an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushing
buttons in vain. He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away from
Holly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance.
Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of:
158-
162XI 	OUT
163		FRANCIS
Entering...gun in hand.
164		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA
As they face Francis.
165		FULL ANGLE - FRANCIS LOGAN AND JESSICA
FRANCIS (frowning)
What's going on, Logan?!
LOGAN
It has nothing to do with you.
FRANCIS
(choking but still loyal)
What are you talking about?! I saw you
let a Runner go?
(up a notch)
I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke
and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention. Instantly Logan
jumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling. Without a look back, he
and Jessica run out.
166 		OUT
166X1		FRANCIS
Enraged, finds his gun on the floor and, before rising, gets off a
shot at them as they disappear. Then leaping to his feet, dashing
off in pursuit.
167		ARCADE TRACKING
Logan and Jessica running through Arcade.
167X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA
Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.
JESSICA
Follow me, Logan. Stay close.
As they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind...
spots them and follows.
168-
173 		OUT
As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with
sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when
booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an
orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random
flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and
stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings
and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and
laughing:
WANTON
I have an empty one, Sandman
Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to
see a man almost carrying her off.
Then the light is gone again and
Jessica with it.
176		LOGAN AND THE WANTON
As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to
pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go
and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica.
177-
179		SERIES OF SHOTS
Logan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off.
INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifold
and multiform -- everybody doing it.
180		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS
Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing
Wantons.
181-182	LOGAN, JESSICA
Brief glimpses of them looking for each other.
183		FRANCIS
Hunting both.
184		WITH LOGAN
As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees
it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple
mirrors enclose them.
Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and
Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides
shut again.
185		FRANCIS
Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and
Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down
again as the orgy continues.
186-
186X1 	OUT
After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in
the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the
wall.
LOGAN
Are you taking me to them?
JESSICA
Yes.
(beat)
I don't know what else to do -- with
him following us.
(she hesitates)
Why do you keep running from your--
LOGAN
Because he's my friend -
(a beat)
and I don't want to be killed by him -
or anyone.
JESSICA
He's good, isn't he?
LOGAN
Will he find us and kill us?
Yes...or one of the others.
(a beat)
You know there's only one place
to go now...
JESSICA (hopelessly)
They won't believe us.
LOGAN
(beat)
I'd rather take my chances with
them...than with Francis.
JESSICA
They wont listen.
LOGAN (interrupting)
You think Sandmen will?
(before she can answer)
There's no other way for me,
JESSICA
We'll convince them.
They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she
turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off.
JESSICA
Yes, Logan.
(turning to him blindly)
I'm glad they didn't change your
face.
Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They
continue down into the darkness.
Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their
footsteps are heard.
187 		OUT
187X1	FRANCIS
At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows
they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away
as he searches.
188-200 	OUT
200X1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA
They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines
wetly in the darkness.
JESSICA (softly)
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.
(they walk)
Now to the right. It's narrow here,
you'll have to get behind me.
LOGAN (whispering)
How will they know we're coming?
JESSICA (whispering)
They're watching us now. They'll
let us in when they're sure.
200X2	CLOSE-UP - LOGAN'S HAND (INSERT)
As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a
signal.
As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly
into action.
200X4	LOGAN AND JESSICA
Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly
heard:
VOICE (scratchy,
filtered)
Sandman, put your hands on your head.
(he does)
Clasp your fingers together. Now turn
your hands over. Palms up.
(beat)
In a moment a light will shine in your
eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first,
then you, Sandman. You will have to
stoop--but don't unclasp your hands.
Do you agree?
Logan nods.
Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the
dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow
rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves
forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends
awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.
201		LOGAN, JESSICA -- SANCTUARY HQ
As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the
side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned
helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden
appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan
is unable to draw his gun.
VOICE
Hold still, Sandman, or die where
you are.
2ND VOICE
Is she the one?
OTHER VOICES (like angry
stage whispers)
She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both.
Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher.
Sandman murderer.
Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their
heads turning to the echoing sibilants.. The spotlight goes off.
202-204 	OUT
In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all
around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points,
steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn.
Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.
LOGAN
I'm a runner. She brought me here because
I begged her to help me.
He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in the
darkness.
At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument.
VOICE
He's lying. No Sandman ever ran.
2ND VOICE
You don't run. You kill runners.
You have killed runners all your life.	-
LOGAN
Yes I have.
(beat)
Now it's my turn. And I want to
live.
Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly:
JESSICA (shouting)
What's the matter with you. He's a runner--
he's blinking. We must help anyone who
asks...we must-or we're the same as they
are--deciding who lives and dies.
One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce
burn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent.
206		LOGAN
Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and
pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer,
shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He
subsides, as VOICES rise angrily "Kill him now".
Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a
CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor.
The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the
chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in
front against the glare. It's Holly.
HOLLY
Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead.
Doc's dead and the Sandmen came...
VOICE (gentle)
Holly--Holly. Remember the code.
The code, please Holly...
HOLLY (hysteria)
They smashed everything and I barely
got away.
(beat)
Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7.
Holly. Holly...
She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the
bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side
and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall.
She reacts with fear at the sight.
HOLLY
It's him! The first Sandman. He
killed...Doc.
JESSICA
No, Holly--wait! He's running.
Tell them the rest!
HOLLY (suddenly
exhausted)
He's the one. You too. I remember.
He was in a hurry. Just a face job.
Dark hair, I said. Then he killed
Doc and you grabbed me--and the
machine blew up and I ran...I ran
JESSICA
Holly. Holly! Please...The other
Sandman. Remember the one who came
after--
Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid.
HOLLY (pouring
it out)
That's right. The other one came after.
The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
JESSICA (coaching
desperately)
...and he was hunting the first one,
this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This
one was running, the other one was
hunting him...
HOLLY (remembers)
Yes. Oh yes.
(to Logan)
He was after you. I remember. You're
running!
207-208 	OUT
208X1	ANOTHER ANGLE 1
The spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved but
shaken, wary.
LOGAN
May we move?
A long beat. Then--
VOICE
I saw we pass them through.
Somebody help Holly.
Other VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room,
hands reaching out to help her.
VOICE
You two. Just go straight ahead.
Follow the corridors with the pipes
overhead to the end. Then use the key.
As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow
around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground
chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light
is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the
room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen.
There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's
obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan
pauses.
LOGAN
I don't know who you are. I'd
like to thank someone.
VOICE
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow
the tunnel to the end.
LOGAN
I Will there be someone to tell us
where to go from there...?
A murmur of discussion then:
VOICE
Someone will follow. When you come to
the lock, he will tell you how Co go
on the other side. Jessica may go with
you as far as the lock.
LOGAN
(a deep breath)
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.
(suddenly his tone is
urgent as he speaks to her)
Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
She is bewildered by the change.
JESSICA
Why?- No...no...I'm going with you.
VOICE1
Only to the lock. After that
there's no way back.
JESSICA (small voice)
I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary.
With you.
A BABBLE of VOICES. "Impossible"...She ignores, watches Logan.
JESSICA (cont'd)
Will you take me with you?
LOGAN
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why.
Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand,
moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He
wheels, pulling her with him.
LOGAN
Come on then--they'll be here any
minute!
Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION
shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen,
led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.
Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING,
RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage
of the room.
209 		OUT
209X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA
As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in
the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They
watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before
them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The
Sandman is smashed away, burning.
209X2	LOGAN
Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down
again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his
crystal can be seen from the room.
210		ANOTHER ANGLE
Francis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching,
stopping as he sees
211		FRANCIS P.O.V.
The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness.
FRANCIS
(believing the
blinking crystal is Jessica's)
Logan. I know you're in here.
What've you done...gone crazy over a
Runner?
(whispering)
Nobody knows except me. You know I
won't say anything. I should have
turned you in but I couldn't. Leave
her. Come on out with me. It'll look
like you're part of the group that
hit this nest.
(pleading)
Logan...you're a Sandman!
(slightest beat)
Logan...now...now...Logan...
After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great
chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision
obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.
212		LOGAN AND JESSICA
As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads
her off down the tunnel.
213		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL
following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but
always down.
214		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK
As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a
kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense
submarine hatch.
The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door
tands in a couple of inches of water.
With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan
gives the wheel a tug...nothing.
SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a
RECORDED VOICE.
VOICE
Runner, this is the last gate. Use
your key now. When the Bell sounds
again...use your key. Good luck,
Runner. May you find Sanctuary.
SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center
of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues
for about ten seconds. Then it stops	and the light goes out.
214X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA
Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:
214X2	ANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.
Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light
and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING
215-216	CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICA
As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.
JESSICA (breathlessly)
Every key only works once...and only
a Lastday key must open this door....
They said it would fit - but....
She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the
dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.
Then Logan remembers.
LOGAN
Wait - I have the one I took from
the Runner.
SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the
Runner's ankh.
Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and
the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.
As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again
another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.
In the
distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.
As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh
into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted
center becomes brighter as the door opens.
There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...
realizes what he has done and is shaken.
As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:
JESSICA
There's no turning back, is there?
Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...
as the door closes and they are:
217		ON THE OTHER SIDE
now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.
Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,
rusted, rotted and wet.
In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to
rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.
Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into
water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.
217X1	WITH FRANCIS
As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.
But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.
FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing
128		LOGAN AND JESSICA
Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out.
(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall...)
219-224	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTS
A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.
B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in
while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.
C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.
JESSICA
How do we know this is the right
way?
LOGAN
It's the only way.
D. POV an alley way full of machinery. Logan gives a wheel a half
turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water.
E. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica's
fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold.
F. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT...
HABITAT MARITIME...ETC.
They speculate.
JESSICA
What do you suppose this was...?
LOGAN
Some kind of breeding pens...I
suppose...They say people used
to breed animal s, fish, anything
(at her disbelieving look)
To eat, of course.
JESSICA
Ycch.
(shudders)
To kill things and then eat them.
It must have been a savage world.
Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too.
G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a small
inspection vessel and suddenly hear:
SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again.
225		POV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHT
moving, hunting.
LOGAN (alert)
Stay here, while I see what it is.
Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a
moment he's back. His face - is grim.
JESSICA
It's Francis, isn't it?
He nods.
226		LOGAN AND JESSICA
Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must
go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic
distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly
seeming small and distant.
As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall,
suddenly:
227		FRANCIS
looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.
228		LOGAN AND JESSICA
Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion,
somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient
machinery GROANS.
They turn and run as they HEAR:
FRANCIS (distorted;
echo; etcetera)
LOGAN N N N.
229		POV - FRANCIS' LIGHT
is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:
THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan
heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back
and they are revealed.
230		CLOSE - ON FRANCIS
aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in
his sights.
231		LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS
Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of
the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over
everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and
pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.
A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning
when the waterlock door closes.
Logan slumps to the floor.
Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside -
flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white
color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door
opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.
It is now very cold.
In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves
close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,
tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is
seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to
move.
JESSICA (whispering)
I'm afraid.
LOGAN
It's brighter there...besides, we
can't go back.
He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back.
JESSICA
Wait.
He halts.
JESSICA (cont'd)
I don't know what's going to happen
to us Logan but --
(a beat)
Are you glad you didn't kill him?
LOGAN
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
JESSICA
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
LOGAN
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?
(Jessica nods)
Why did you stay with me?
JESSICA (feelingly)
I wanted to...
(Logan puts his arms
around her)
...And you...what made you kill Sandmen?
LOGAN
I had to. I did kill...for the
first time in my life I killed.
JESSICA
Because you felt like a Runner,
didn't you.
LOGAN
I guess so...I know I felt something
I never felt before...and I didn't
like it...not a bit.
(after another long beat)
I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary
better be worth it. That's the last
place for me to live now.
JESSICA
For us.
Logan mouths "Us"...a strange word...and why not... in the last
minutes he has done strange things.
234-236 	OUT
Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side
and revealing for the first time where they are.
236x2	ANGLE
Before them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless
row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and
contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To the
side, a bright light.
236x3	LOGAN AND JESSICA
Walk toward the light.
236x4	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA
We see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with
extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a
tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds.
236x5	ANOTHER ANGLE
As they look in wonder:
VOICE
Overwhelming, isn't it?
Logan and Jessica turn and see:
237-238	OUT
239		FULL ANGLE - BOX
Box is half-man...half-metal.
From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables.
One hand is a cutting tool. His head is half-flesh...half-metal. his
legs are a chrome pedestal.
BOX
Are you too startled? Am I too
removed from your ken?
(slightest beat)
I'm neither machine nor man...but
a perfect fusion of the two...and
better than either.
(with great pride)
No human sculptor could match this
greatness...don't you agree?
LOGAN
All right - what are you?
BOX (laughs)
Your turn.
JESSICA
It's incredibly beautiful.
BOX
Ah, but wait for the winds. Then
my birds sing. My walrus breathes.
My palace chimes and bells. And the
deep grottoes whisper my name...Box
Box...Bahhhhxxxxsss...
LOGAN (after a beat)
We're hungry	do you have anything
to eat?
BOX
Anything to eat?
Box starts to laugh...He is roaring with laughter as:
JESSICA (quietly)
We're human and we're hungry.
BOX (still laughing)
I know...I know.
LOGAN
This place is a link to Sanctuary,
isn't it?
Box looks totally confused.
LOGAN (angrily)
How do you think we got here??!!
BOX
You walked in. I saw you. Don't
you remember?
Logan contains his anger.
LOGAN (beginning
again; quietly)
Where do you think we came from?
BOX
From? From? From?
LOGAN
We were sent here and you know it.
Others have been sent here. Where
are they? Hiding?
Box looks around the cavern:
BOX (mischievously)
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
LOGAN
Where do we go?!
(up a notch)
Where do we go from here??!!
We hear a NOISE outside.
BOX
Is that the wind?
(smiling)
Not yet...
(slightest beat)
You must hear my birds sing.
LOGAN
You know about Sanctuary! I know
you do! You have to help us! You
don't have a choice! It isn't your
decision!! Tell us.
BOX
Never a pair. I have never had a
pair.
LOGAN
Where do you send them?
BOX
You're a beautiful pair.
JESSICA
Please.
BOX
I've never seen humans whom I thought
worthy of being here...
(a beat)
I'd like to sculpt you.
(looking around)
Where would I put you?
(smiling)
I know...you'd be the base of the
column. You'd hold up my world!
LOGAN (exasperated)
Answer the question!
BOX
Do you know how long all this will
last? Not thirty years...or thirty
thousand years...but thirty thousand
thousand years...and you'll be part
of it. Ages will roll...Ages. And
you'll be here...the two of you...
eternally frozen...frozen...beautiful.
LOGAN (to Jessica)
There must be somebody else up here.
I can't believe that he's--
BOX (interrupting;
his voice tone changing;
very lucid)
Let me sculpt you and I will show
you where the others have gone.
LOGAN
That's better.
(slightest beat)
How do you want us?
BOX
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
LOGAN (starting to
take off his clothes;
as Jessica hesitates,
Logan smiles)
It'll be all right...
240-241	JESSICA
Undresses.
Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs.
BOX
Up there.
Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal. As they stand there:
LOGAN
How do you want us?
BOX (beat)
Up there.
Logan looks at Jessica. Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight.
Logan takes Jessica into his arms.
BOX
Enchanting. Is that what humans do?
By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to
Box...their arms are enveloping one another...with strong feelings.
BOX'S VOICE
Superb!
242		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX
As his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the
huge column supporting the cavern.
As he works furiously...at Incredible speed:
243		LOGAN AND JESSICA
...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue
to hold one another.
244-245	OUT
246		CLOSE - ON BOX
BOX (stepping back)
Done...behold...!
247		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA
Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and
passionately.
Their mood is broken by:
BOX'S VOICE
Done...Done...Done...
Logan and Jessica break. They turn and see:
248		FULL ANGLE - THE ICE SCULPTURE
Box has captured them perfectly...shimmering with life...filled with
emotion.
249		WIDE ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX
There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.
JESSICA (squeezing
Logan's hand)
It's glorious
Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.
LOGAN
All right. Now you keep your
bargain.
BOX (rapt by his
work)
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear
the birds sing over you!
LOGAN (only interested
in getting out)
We're ready.
Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice
Cavern.
As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica.
This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide.
It stretches back as far as the eye can see.
The ice along the left wall is frosted...but the ice along the right
wall is perfectly clear.
And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are:
251		WIDE ANGLE - MEN AND WOMEN
Standing in erect positions.
At first it appears that they might be more of Box's perfect works
of sculpture.
But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear
ice...it is soon apparent that they are real people...who have been
frozen.
252		CLOSE ON LOGAN AND JESSICA
Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.
253		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MEN AND WOMEN FROZEN
IN THE WALL
We can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm
of their right hands.
Logan walks to the end of this wall. Each frozen body has a number
above it. The final body's number is 1056...That number which the
voice in Sandman's headquarters revealed as the number of missing
Runners.
The CAMERA PANS Logan back to Box.
254		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX
As Logan turns toward him.
LOGAN (stupefied)
How did they get in here?
BOX
Regular storage procedure...the
same as the other food... The
other food stopped coming and they
started.
LOGAN
What other food?
BOX
Fish and plankton, sea greens and
protein from the sea.
(pointing to the frosted
ice wall)
It's all here - ready - fresh as
harvest day. Fish and plankton,
sea greens and protein from the
sea...And then it stopped coming
and they (gesture) came instead.
So I store them here. I'm ready.
And you're ready. It's my Job -
protein, plankton, grass from the
sea
Logan pulls out his gun.
LOGAN
Tell us how to get out...or Ill
destroy you..I'll kill you!
Box laughs...The same LOUD, ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier.
Then:
BOX (calmly)
Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand
you facing one another.
Box starts his saw hand BUZZING.
He turns all the flesh parts of
his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica
who is now standing behind Logan.
Box is now like an armed vehicle.
Logan FIRES...the fire reflecting harmlessly off Box's metal frame.
BOX (advancing)
Resign yourself.
255		MED. ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA
Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail.
As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of
this room and:
256		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX
Advancing
We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSON...embedded in the clear wall of ice.
A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama.
257		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA
Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as:
258		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX
Relentlessly moving toward them.
259		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA
Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall.
Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving
his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or
button which might open it.
The entire time he never takes his eyes off:
260		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX
Getting closer. The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY.
BOX (chilling tone)
I make such a small, quick incision ...
you can hardly feel it.
261		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA
Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above
them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables.
262		FULL ANGLE - LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX
Box is practically upon them.
As he lunges forward with his
WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down
alongside her.
Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice
out of the rear wall as:
Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to
penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but
hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.
There is an EXPLOSION.
BOX (looking up;
screaming)
No! The coils!
Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern
containing his sculptures.
BOX (still screaming)
All my work!' All my work!!
As Logan and Jessica stand:
263-270	OUT
270x1	ANGLE - THE REFRIGERANT COILS
Bursting open, discharging great streams of gases.
270x2	LOGAN
Seeing the effect, shooting again and again at the ceiling and
walls.
270x3	ANOTHER ANGLE
Coils bursting everywhere, vapor billowing into the cavern.
270x4	ANOTHER ANGLE
Huge slabs of ice instantly loosening, crashing over.
270x5	FULL SHOT
AS the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing
over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing.
270x6	BOX
Careening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and
flicker out.
270X7	ANGLE
The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again
and again like great spears and wedges
270X8	BOX
Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring
ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness.
270X9	LOGAN AND JESSICA
Cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by
Being in an angle of the cave.
270X10	FULL SHOT
The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus. Silence.
Then:
SOUND: Ice melting, water running.
270X11	LOGAN AND JESSICA
Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive.
SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into
the water.
As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and
see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by
the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening.
Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out.
271-272	OUT
Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled.
277-287X1
OUT
288		EXT . - FOREST AREA
As Logan and Jessica reach it.
They are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment...then
continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched,
etcetera.
A swarm of insects attack...Logan and Jessica fight them off:
JESSICA (starting to panic)
I hate outside! I hate it!
LOGAN (holding her;
comforting tone)
We'll be all right...
(a beat)
We will...
The sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in
the grass...startling them for a moment.
288XA1	FRANCIS
Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the
unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica
did.
288XB1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - A BUSHY AREA
They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them
and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth...Jesslca
grabs hold of his hand.
JESSICA
Don't!
LOGAN
Sooner or later, we'll have to try
something
Logan eats the berries...as Jessica watches intently.
After a beat
LOGAN
They're good.
Logan and Jessica pick berries and eat. When they are finished:
JESSICA
It's getting dark and cold.
I'm tired.
LOGAN
Why don't we rest here? We know we can
eat these.
They sit on the ground.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
288X1	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA - NIGHT
Sitting on the ground.
Jessica is shivering. Logan has his arms around her trying to keep
her warm.
JESSICA
Where do you think that heat-ball went?
Logan shrugs.
JESSICA
Do you think everything's going to
turn to ice?
LOGAN
I doubt it.
JESSICA
Don't ever let go.
LOGAN
I won't.
After a long beat:
LOGAN
It all seemed to make sense until
Box.
JESSICA
Do you think he was telling the
Truth?
Logan shrugs.
JESSICA (trying to
convince herself)
Maybe we're the first ones to get
through...
(hopeful tone)
Maybe Sanctuary is near, now...
another protected place. It couldn't
be outside.
LOGAN (grunts)
How would anyone know? Even if we find
it -- we can never go back.
At her stricken look...Logan touches her in a caring way.
LOGAN
You're right...it must be near
now. We'll find it.
JESSICA (yawning;
closing her eyes; resting
on his shoulder)
Thirty thousand years didn't last
very long, did they?
Logan and Jessica walk toward statue L-R. They stop and look up.
301X8	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
Looking up at statue.
301X9	WHAT THEY SEE: THE STATUE OF LINCOLN (MATTE PAINTING)
301X10	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
Looking up at statue.
LOGAN
I have never seen a face like that
before. It must be the look of great
age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
JESSICA (beat)
Yes, do you think that's why he looks
so sad---?
Logan shrugs. They turn, start to EXIT from memorial.
(MATTE COMPOSITE)
Logan and Jessica EXITING.
301X12	LOGAN AND JESSICA
301X13	OVER LOGAN AND JESSICA - WASHINGTON MONUMENT
AND CAPITOL IN B.G. (MATTE COMPOSITE)
They walk through pond toward capitol.
301X14	CEMETERY - CAPITOL IN B.G. (MATTE COMPOSITE)	301X14

Logan and Jessica walking past gravestones.
301X15	LOGAN AND JESSICA'S POV - GRAVESTONES	301X15
301X16	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
As they pass the stones, Logan glances at them.
LOGAN
They all have names and numbers
on them. I wonder what they are?
JESSICA
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife".
What can all that mean?
Just then their attention is focused by a distant SOUND as of
SHOUTING -- a man's voice. Jessica stops.
JESSICA
Francis?
Logan shakes his head. They EXIT cemetery toward capitol.
301X17	LONG SHOT - CAPITOL (MATTE COMPOSITE)
Logan and Jessica walking up steps toward building.
301X18	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA
Walking up the steps...many of which are cracked.
They are proceeding with great caution...as they enter the Capitol
Building.
Logan and Jessica enter the ancient room. They stop and look around.
301X20	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
SOUND: HAMMERING NOISE -- irregular. It stops after a bit.
They walk to the door and open it cautiously.
They EXIT right.
Logan and Jessica walking down corridor, left to right.
The SOUND continues.
Logan and Jessica as Logan opens the aged door.
301X22A	CLOSEUP - A CAT SQUALLING OUT INTO CAMERA
301X23	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
React, then they enter Senate and stop and look.
HAIRED MAN OF S SIXTY-PLUS
There are HUNDREDS OF CATS...and THOUSANDS OF BOOKS all over the
place.
JESSICA (frowning;
whispering)
Look at his face...and his hair...
(grimacing)
Is that what it is to grow old?
LOGAN (still stunned)
It could be...
There are a COUPLE OF CATS on the man's lap as he turns and faces
Logan and Jessica...when he HEARS them move closer.
The man is stroking the cats calmly...unperturbed by the appearance
of Logan and Jessica.
LOGAN
How old are you?
MAN
As old as I am I suppose...who
knows ?
LOGAN
Your hair is white.
MAN
It wasn't always. I remember when
it wasn't. But it wasn't your
color either.
(looking at Jessica)
...or yours. I have my color somewhere.
JESSICA
Those cracks in your face...do they hurt?
MAN
Oh, no...
JESSICA
Could I touch them?
MAN
Oh, my...please try.
Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face.
JESSICA
What's your name?
MAN
I've forgotten. It's been so
long since I've used it.
Logan and Jessica exchange a quick glance...feeling they have come
upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake.
MAN
But all of my cats have names.
LOGAN
Is that what they're called--
cats?
OLD MAN
Yes, cats, of course. What else
could they be? Cats. Of course
each one has his own name too.
JESSICA
But there are so many of them.
Do you know each one separately.
OLD MAN
Yes indeed, everyone. Actually,
they all have three.
(reciting)
"The naming of cats is a difficult
matter. It isn't just one of your
holiday games. You may think at
first I'm mad as a hatter when I
tell you a cat must have THREE
DIFFERENT NAMES."
(a beat)
An ordinary name and a fancy name.
That's two. Do you want to guess
what the third one is?
Logan and Jessica are silent.
OLD MAN (reciting again)
"But above and beyond there's
still one name left over,
And that is the name that you
never will guess;
The name that no human research
can discover -- -
But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and
will never confess."
(reaching down and
stroking another cat)
Will you, my pet?
One of the cats jumps off his lap.
OLD MAN (reciting)
"Why did you go little fourpaws?
You forgot to shut your big eyes."
(the man closes his
eyes for a moment; then:)
"I have a Gumble Cat in mind!"
As the man opens his eyes:
LOGAN
How long have you been living
here?
OLD MAN
For as long as I can remember.
LOGAN
What kind of place is this?
OLD MAN
Just a place, I suppose...who
knows?
The man looks puzzled.
LOGAN
How did you get here?
OLD MAN
I have always been here...
LOGAN
Are there any other humans?
OLD MAN
Gracious...no.
LOGAN
Have any other people ever passed
through?
The man shakes his head...then:
OLD MAN
But there may be a few around somewhere.
LOGAN
What makes you think so?
OLD MAN
My parents thought so. Mother and
Father. You know?
LOGAN (astonished)
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother
and father?
The man nods.
JESSICA
And...and how were you grown? Inside
your mother?
OLD MAN
Yes...
JESSICA
Are you sure?
OLD MAN
Mother and Father said so... you know?
LOGAN
Where are they?
OLD MAN
Dead...they're dead...and buried.
JESSICA (not knowing
what it is)
Buried???
Logan wheels...as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING
SLIGHTLY...as it opens a bit wider:
302		CLOSE ON A CAT
Coming through the opening - did he push it?
303		CLOSE ON THE MAN
OLD MAN (pleased;
reciting)
"Gus is the cat at the theatre door.
His name, as I ought to have told
you before, Is really Asparagus.
That's such a fuss To pronounce,
that we usually call him just Gus."
306		WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN AND JESSICA
OLD MAN
May I see your hand again?
Logan and Jessica extend their left hands. The Old Man takes them,
looks from one to another with delight.
OLD MAN
They're beautiful. May I have
one too please?
LOGAN
No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.
OLD MAN (offended)
It isn't fair. I'll give you one
of my favorite cats...a Jellicle
cat.
(reciting)
"Jellicle cats have cheerful faces,
Jellicle cats have bright black eyes;
They like to practice their airs and graces
And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
LOGAN
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to
give you.
As the man continues to look petulant:
JESSICA (simply;
sincerely)
That's the truth.
Jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man.
JESSICA
Here you can have this.
The man seems pleased.
OLD MAN
What kind of jewel is this?
JESSICA
I don't know.
OLD MAN
You're both full of secrets like
Macavity.
(looking at the ring)
Did you steal this?
JESSICA
No.
OLD MAN
(reciting)
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no
one like Macavity,
There never was a cat of such
deceitfulness and suavity."
LOGAN
What's beyond this place - do you
know?
OLD MAN
No, no, no
LOGAN
Did your Mother or Father ever
mention another place?
OLD MAN
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
After a pause:
LOGAN
May we stay here for a while?
We'd like to rest.
OLD MAN
Of course you can stay. This
belongs to the people.
JESSICA
What belongs to the people?
OLD MAN
All this. All of it.
JESSICA
What people?
OLD MAN
I don't know...but it does.
The man stands...and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining
room.
OLD MAN
I'll be right back.
(stopping)
Oh, yes...about the cats...
one rule is true:
(reciting)
"Don't speak till you are spoken to."
The man smiles and leaves.
305		LOGAN AND JESSICA
Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down.
Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it.
Logan is deep in thought.
Jessica looks up from the book.
JESSICA (quietly)
How curious people used to be --
All these books...
Silence...until:
LOGAN
That sweet madman -- how could he
Come to exist?
JESSICA
He had a mother and father --
and he knew them.
LOGAN
One in a million, I suppose
LOGAN AND JESSICA (together;
smiling)
...Who knows?
JESSICA (after a beat)
We're going on, aren't we?
LOGAN
(shaking his head)
There's nothing to go on to, Jessica.
Logan continues to shake his head through Jessica's following line:
JESSICA
There's a Sanctuary...there is!
LOGAN
You want there to be one...that
Doesn't...
JESSICA (interrupting;
urgent tone)
There has to be! I know it exists! It
has to!!
LOGAN (gently)
No, there doesn't. Not really --just so
many want it to exist...so many who
don't want to die...want it so much
that a place called Sanctuary becomes
"real". But it doesn't exist. It never
existed. Just the hope.
JESSICA (becoming
hysterical)
You're wrong!! It has to be!!
It Just has to be!!
As Logan takes her in his arms...comforting her:
306		FULL ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MAN
The man returns with a portrait in hand.
OLD MAN
Oh, my don't cry.
The man proudly shows them the portrait....which is a portrait of
himself in his twenties. He sort of brushes the hair...which is rich
auburn.
OLD MAN (gesturing)
There are larger pictures of other
people over there. I don't know who
they are. Perhaps they're family.
She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner.
307		CLOSE ON - JESSICA
Remaining near the podium. She is dejected. Logan's argument that
there is no Sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold.
308 		OUT
308x1	THE CORNER - LOGAN AND THE OLD MAN
We see portraits of Presidents of the United States.
We can recognize all of them...with the exception of the dozen or so
that come after Ford.
As Logan looks at the portraits he recognizes Lincoln.
LOGAN
That's the same fellow who's outside.
If he was so important - why isn't he
first?
The old man shakes his head.
309		INT - SENATE CHAMBER - CLOSE ON - JESSICA
As Francis suddenly appears alongside her.
Jessica is terrified...speechless. Francis glances across the
chamber, sees Logan. When he speaks, it is softly but urgently.
FRANCIS
What did you do to him?
Jessica is silent. Francis' tone becomes increasingly sexual.
FRANCIS
Why? Why you?
(grabbing her)
Do you know you ruined him? Do
you know that? Can you tell me
why? Why you?
(a beat)
And now you've killed him, you
know...
Francis starts to tear off her clothes...obviously to rape...but his
expression remains cold and without passion.
JESSICA (screaming)
Logan!!!
As she screams, Francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her
O.S.
310 		OUT
310x1	LOGAN
hears the scream, wheels -- sees nothing for a moment.
FRANCIS' VOICE
Here!!!!
Logan looks up...and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of
the first row of the gallery...with his gun pointing down at Logan,
holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm.
OLD MAN (cheerfully)
How nice...more company...
FRANCIS (emotional;
disjointed thoughts)
We had such good times together...
I let you go!
(frenzied)
You didn't terminate a Runner and
I let you go!!
(a beat)
She did this to us! How could you
let her?! An ordinary available??!!
(with this he flings
Jessica down and away.
She lies there...stunned)
And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8?
(a tear in his eye)
....Why didn't you chink about them?!
(up a notch)
There's over two hundred years of
Sandmen's blood in you, Logan....
and now you'll spill it for a
stinking Runner!!
312		CLOSE ON - LOGAN
Holding up his right palm.
LOGAN
Look at your palm, Francis....
look! It's clear. Clear!
313		REVERSE ANGLE - FRANCIS
Looking at his palm....shocked...dropping his gun. It falls on the
CHAMBER FLOOR.
FRANCIS
Why did you do that??!!
LOGAN
I didn't do anything, Francis!
They've made us believe that....
FRANCIS (interrupting;
wild)
Why did you do that???!!!
Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan.
314		WIDE ANGLE - CATS
Scattering in all directions as:
315-319	CLOSE ACTION SHOTS - FRANCIS AND LOGAN
In hand to hand combat punching...Kicking...wrestling
320		INTERCUT WITH: JESSICA AND THE MAN REACTING
Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and
Francis were putting on a show for him.
321-331	THE FIGHT- SERIES OF SHOTS
A. Francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on Logan.
B. As Logan slumps to the floor and Francis cries to follow through
his advantage by crushing Logan's face with his foot:
C. Logan grabs Francis' foot and twists it...sending Francis reeling
backward.
D. Standing, Logan grabs a table and hurls it at Francis...who
ducks.
E. Francis sees a steel flagpole (with an American flag that has
sixty-one stars) and takes hold of it.
F. Francis moves toward Logan...with the menacing steel flagpole in
front of him.
G. Logan is wary...watching every movement of the steel pole.
H. Francis swings the steel pole twice...We can HEAR the WHISH-WHISH
as it cuts through the air...with Logan avoiding the blows.
I. On the third swing...Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and
swings around on it...kicking Francis in the chest.
J. Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward.
Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment
as Logan crashes the steel pole (which he is now holding) down on
Francis' head.
K. Francis crumbles to the floor. Feebly, he raises a hand toward
Logan...
Logan touches Francis' hand and Francis grasps his wrist, holding
death off with the strong grip.
FRANCIS (delirious)
That was the right shot--Look out
there, he's trying to break free
Watch it, Logan, steady, now!......
His eyes focus briefly and he sees Logan's palm-the crystal shining
clear and white. Francis is suddenly radiant.
FRANCIS
Logan! You renewed!
And he is dead.	DIRECT CUT TO:
332		JESSICA AND THE MAN
The man walks over to Francis and bends down.
OLD MAN
Oh, my...he died...
333		CLOSE ON - LOGAN
Rubbing his face with the palms of his hands...clearly upset.
334		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING JESSICA AND THE MAN
OLD MAN
Well have to bury him.
JESSICA
Whats that?
OLD MAN
Theyre put into the ground so
they can be visited by the living...
Logans eyes are glistening with tears.
The man starts out.
OLD MAN
Ill make the arrangements.
JESSICA (softly)
At least its over...
Jessicas words dont help as Logan shakes his head...then:
OLD MAN
Are you ready to put him in?
LOGAN
Not yet.
OLD MAN
All right.
The man sits down.
Gently, Logan lifts Francis body...trying to straighten him out
from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the
floor.
After resting Francis body on the floor again.
He cradles Francis
head in his arms.
DISSOLVE TO:
335-338	OUT
On Logan sleeping - Jessica and Old Man in a spirited but soft
conversation in a far corner.
As Logan wakes he hears:
OLD MAN
Of course...that's settled then.
But just you remember your promise...
JESSICA
We'll remember. But that's a long time
off...
She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling. Logan
rises to her.
LOGAN
What are we promising him? What can we
possibly give him?
JESSICA
He asked if we would bury him when his
time comes.
LOGAN (beat)
We can't. We're going back.
JESSICA
To what?
LOGAN
I'm going to try and tell people what
we've seen and--
JESSICA (interrupting)
You're lying! You'll never have the
chance to tell anybody anything!
You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
LOGAN
Do you expect me to let things go on
without trying to change them?!
JESSICA
Things won't change...you know that!
We can live here together, Logan...
have a life as long as his... together!
LOGAN (showing his palm)
Things change!
JESSICA
You want to go back to kill, is that it?!
Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill
Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!
Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical.
LOGAN (softly)
Jessica...listen to me...listen to me...
(as she quiets down)
The Lifeclocks made me kill
Francis. They make people die or
be killed every day. If I didn't
try and destroy that...I couldn't
live here or anywhere. Do you
understand?
JESSICA
I want to be alive and with you,
that's all I want.
Logan puts his arms around her.
LOGAN
I know...I know...
The Old Man comes to them, wondering.
LOGAN
We're leaving.
OLD MAN
What a pity. I was hoping you'd
be here to bury me.
JESSICA
Come with us.
OLD MAN
Where are you going?
LOGAN
To a city with thousands and thousands
of people.
OLD MAN
Alive?
Logan nods.
OLD MAN
Thousands and thousands...as many as
my cats?
LOGAN
More...many more.
OLD MAN
And all alive you say?
Logan nods.
OLD MAN
Yes, I would like to see that. Is it
a long journey?
Again, Logan nods.
OLD MAN (mumbling)
Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...
340-349	OUT
350		HIGH ANGLE - GREENBELT AREA - SHOOTING DOWN - DAY
Logan, Jessica and the Old MAN are walking...with the Capitol
Building blurred by overgrown foliage receding in the b.g. of the
SHOT.
351-361 	OUT
Emerging from the water.
It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and
impulse collectors.
Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit.
369-
369Xl 	OUT
369AX2	GREAT HALL - AT CAROUSEL ENTRANCE
As the CROWD is pouring in:
LOGAN'S VOICE
No!! Don't go in there !!
The CROWD turns and looks up at:
369X2	LOGAN
On a high balcony in the Great Hall.
Looking down at them.
LOGAN
You don't have to die!! No one has
to die at thirty!!! You don't have
to blink out on Lastday. There's no
renewal on Carrousel! You can live
longer and grow old... I've seen it.
She's seen it!! Believe me!!
There is an angry murmur in the CROWD as Logan continues:
LOGAN (holding up
his palm)
See... it's' clear. The Lifeclocks
are a lie - Carousel is a lie!!
369X3	WIDEN ANGLE - INCLUDING SANDMEN
Trying to grab Logan. There is a struggle. Some Sandmen are knocked
over the railing.
But remaining Sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues Logan
and Jessica.
The CROWD cheers...and continues into Carousel as:
It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to
find and destroy Sanctuary.
In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading:
PROBABILITY
blinks on and off.
Logan is dragged in by a number of SANDMEN.
We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by SANDMEN in the
b.g. of the SHOT.
Logan is placed on the chair in which his CRYSTAL was altered.
371		CLOSE ANGLE - LOGAN IN THE CHAIR
A shaft of light glows on and he stiffens - bound by it.
372 		OUT
372X1-
372X3	FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE SCREEN
As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish HEADS appear
-- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these
heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds.
As the real Logan (in the chair) is questioned, each of the heads
answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.
373-378 	OUT
378X1-
378X18	INTERCUT WITH CLOSER SHOTS OF LOGAN HIMSELF WRITHING IN
AGONY AS THE IMPASSIVE HEADS SPEAK.
ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN AND HEADS
A. 						FIRST HEAD SPEAKS
(Logan's voice)
A Jewelry store.
B. Logan himself - twisting in pain.
C. The word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.
D.						A SECOND HEAD
(Logan's voice)
A creature called Box - all frozen,
all frozen.
E. Logan writhes in the chair.
F. Again the word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.
G. 						A THIRD IDENTICAL HEAD
(Logan's Voice)
No...There is no Sanctuary.
H. The SCREEN seems to shimmer. It blinks.
I. A third time the word negative appears on the SCREEN.
J. 						A FOURTH HEAD
(Logan's voice)
There is no Sanctuary
K. The SCREEN'S glow increases...to an almost blinding light...
starting to frighten the Sandmen present.
L. At the same time, we see JESSICA coming out of her tranquilized
daze...fearful...still in the Sandmen's custody.
M.						A FIFTH HEAD
(Logan's voice)
An old man without a crystal...But
there is no Sanctuary.
N. Now the SCREEN is starting to spark. Behind it we SEE the
intermittent glow of overheated electronic components.
O. And we see the word negative...once more on the SCREEN -- but
broken now.
P. 						A SIXTH HEAD
(Logan's voice)
There is no Sanctuary.
Q. Now the noise and the light from the SCREEN are peaking...and we
can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen.
R. On the SCREEN the word negative is beginning to shake...as the
SCREEN begins to shake.
379		FULL ANGLE - THE SIX HEADS
LOGAN'S VOICE (emanating
from all of them)
There is no Sanctuary. There is
no Sanctuary.
The sign PROBABILITY bursts...the SIX HEADS of Logan go out.
The noise and the light coming out of the screen Increase, as it
begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame.
380-410 	OUT
410X1	ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN
Straining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a
puff of smoke -- releasing him. Logan staggers to his feet in time
to meet:
410X2	SANDMEN
Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in
on Logan One holding Jessica.
410X3	LOGAN AND SANDMEN
Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him
with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A
Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the
Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc.
Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks
which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and
discharges.
410X4	THE BATTLE
The electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion.
Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the
machinery. Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving.
Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke. Helps her to her feet.
Crouched, they make for the exit.
410X5	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE. SCREEN
Sputtering its life out in strange predictive words....PROBABILITY
flashing on and off.... EQUILIBRIUM...DESTRUCT...EQUIL...NO
BALANCE...NO BALANCE...FAMINE... INACCEPTABLE ...NO BALANCE...etc.,
flashing vainly through the eddying smoke and the fierce discharges
which fill the great room.
410X6	SANDMEN
The battle is lost -- the smoke and noise overwhelming. They pick up
their wounded and get out as best they can.
Sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of
fire behind them.
Through the smoke, etc. The Lifeclocks EXPLODE.
