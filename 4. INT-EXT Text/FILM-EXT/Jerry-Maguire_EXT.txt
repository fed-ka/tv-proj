Remo's 14 year-old SON (JESSE) confronts Jerry outside the
hospital room. He's a hulking kid, a Pop Warner football
player himself. His voice is in the process of changing.
6.
SON
This is his fourth concussion.
Shouldn't somebody get him to stop?
As he talks, Jerry's cellular phone rings in his bag.
JERRY
(glib, easy)
Come on -- it'd take a tank to
stop your dad.
It would take all
five Super Trooper VR Warriors,
right?
The kid stares at Maguire.
It feels as if the kid is peering
into his soul... and all he sees is trash.
SON
Fuck you.
The kid turns and exits in disgust.
He leaves Jerry standing
in the hallway.
Devastated. Music.
Jerry Maguire upset in a rental shuttle.
Passing through
frame. Music.
Phone still ringing.
Crowded outdoor restaurant in the business district. Jerry
sits down opposite Bob Sugar, still making a few notes.
JERRY
Gimme a second here... Tidwell...
Arizona contract... new glass
cabinet...
SUGAR
You okay?
JERRY
(looking up)
I'm fine.
What's up?
SUGAR
I came here to let you go.
27.
JERRY
Pardon me?
SUGAR
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
For a long moment there is only silence.
They study each
other. These are two smart boys, each one anticipating the
other's next three or four moves.
SUGAR
(continuing)
It's real, Jerry.
You... you
should say something.
Suddenly he's flushed, a little embarrassed.
JERRY
Aw shit...the crowded
restaurant... so there's no
scene...
SUGAR
I know.
It sucks.
I suck.
In a back room, the waiters are singing the restaurant's
"Birthday Song" to someone else. Jerry is dying.
JERRY
You...
SUGAR
(razor sharp)
You did this to yourself.
You
said "fewer clients."
You put it
all on paper.
Scully was very
upset.
Heart attacks make some
people sweeter, but not him.
You
did this to yourself --
Jerry's mouth opens to finish his sentence, but before he can
speak, Sugar continues.
SUGAR
(continuing)
-- although I do gotta hand it to
you.
For about five minutes you
had everyone applauding smaller
revenues.
Quietly, Maguire finishes the sentence he started earlier.
JERRY
You... ungrateful... unctuous...
28.
SUGAR
(unctuous)
... dick?
JERRY
Dick.
Maguire reaches for water.
The sound of the ice cubes
jangling is suddenly very loud to him. He is drowning.
SUGAR
Give me a little credit for doing
this face-to-face!
What I went
through knowing I was going to do
this to my mentor!
Can you get
past yourself for a second?
JERRY
You'll lose.
SUGAR
(musically)
You wanted smaller.
JERRY
I'm over it.
Now I want all my
clients and yours too.
SUGAR
Jerry --
JERRY
-- and I'll get 'em.
SUGAR
(patronizing)
You'll always be my hero, Jerry.
Always always always.
We're
bringing other elements in, we're
focusing on endorsements -- it's
not about handholding anymore.
We're no longer babysitters --
Jerry fights the desire to use his fists.
Hangs onto the
table. He's starting to freak out now. Trying to calm down.
Sugar's mouth keeps moving, but we hear the music in Jerry's
mind.
Rising percussive music.
Jerry tries to move briskly down the street, through the
lunchtime businessmen traffic. Back to the office.
29.
Sugar at the table.
Chameleon-like, he adopts the
personality of whomever he talks to.
SUGAR
Cush.
Hey Dudeboy!
It's Bob
Sugar. Listen, I'm callin' ya
first 'cause you're the most
important guy in sports...
Sugar strolls back to the office, talking on the portable.
SUGAR
You read that memo I snuck to you,
the guy's tired of the job.
Tired
of making you money.
Bam.
Jerry's door opens.
He exits his office with box.
He
is now in a state of advancing melancholy, slightly unhinged.
Many of the other agents now try not to watch him leaving.
37.
JERRY
Well, don't worry!
I'm not going
to do what you think I'm going to
do, which is FLIP OUT!
JERRY
(continuing)
Jerry goes to a water dispenser, calming himself, and fills
a small Dixie cup.
Downs it and fills it again, rubbing his
face..
JERRY
(continuing)
But let me just say, as I ease out
of the office I helped build --
sorry, but it's a fact --
ON DOROTHY -- WATCHING
from her cubicle.
JERRY
-- that there is such a thing as
manners.
A way of treating
people...
He notices the fish tank nearby. He attemps to be profound.
JERRY
(continuing)
These fish have manners!
They
have manners.
And now Jerry feels bravado, mixed with a wave of anger.
Another cup of water as he finds power.
JERRY
(continuing)
In fact.
They're coming with me!
I'm starting a new company, and
the fish will come with me and...
you can call me sentimental.
He begins dipping into the tank, grabbing the one exotic fish
that failed to escape his cup. It's a fire-tailed Peruvian
beauty.
He grabs a baggie from an assistant's desk, shakes
out some crumbs, and dumps the fish inside.
JERRY
(continuing; to fish)
it's okay... it's okay...
Nearby, a Xerox Repair Guy watches the human train wreck.
38.
JERRY
(continuing)
But if anybody else wants to come
with me, this moment will be the
ground floor of something real and
fun and inspiring and true in this
godforsaken business and we will
do it together!
Who's coming with
me besides... "Flipper" here?
But clearly even Flipper is not happy with the new
arrangement. Panicked, he whips around the small baggie.
JERRY
(continuing)
Anybody going with me?
Silence, someone coughs, as agents and office personnel look
on with equal parts pity and embarrassment. Jerry downs
another small cup of water. His lid is blowing off with each
second.
JERRY
(continuing)
Wendy?
Shall we?
Assistant Wendy looks at Maguire.
Painfully polite:
WENDY
I'm three months away from the pay
increase, Jerry.
I have to, uh...
you know, stay.
Jerry absorbs the blow, and takes the keys from the top of
her desk.
She can't look at him.
Jerry stands alone, the
blue Mission Statement on Wendy's desk sits accusingly in
frame.
There is only silence now, the loudest kind.
JERRY
Okay, anybody else?
ON DOROTHY
She looks around.
Doesn't anybody believe in the very thing
they were applauding three days ago?
She has an odd
reaction, a muscle twitch of the soul.
Before she knows it,
she stands boldly, unfortunately knocking a cup of coffee
onto herself in the process.
DOROTHY
I'll go with you.
(quietly, on her
coffee mess)
Wonderful...
39.
She dabs at her pants.
Next to her, Cleo looks on sadly.
ON JERRY
halfway across the office.
JERRY
Dorothy Boyd!
Thank you!
She gathers her things, increasingly aware of what she's done.
JERRY
(continuing)
We will see you all again.
Sleep
tight!
He walks to Dorothy, and together they exit down the hallway
corridor, past the framed posters and awards.
WIDE-SHOT
rising over the huge office.
For the first time, we see the
full expanse of the huge SMI headquarters.
And down in the
corner of the frame, two small figures leave carrying boxes.
JERRY
(to Dorothy)
Let's see how they do without us.
A beat of silence, then noise returns to its normal
commercial roar.
A couple of fleas have been swatted off the
carcass of an immense beast.
Jerry and Dorothy walk to their cars.
Music in distance.
DOROTHY
So I know this is a bad time,
but -- you will have a medical
program, right?
JERRY
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
He spaces out for a moment.
Awkwardly, she touches him
briefly.
DOROTHY
And I guess we didn't talk about
money.
So, I'll just dive in --
JERRY
Give me your number.
I'll call
tomorrow.
I'm just a little. I'm
a little insane right now.
(off her look)
But it's going to be great.
DOROTHY
No no, I know --
They arrive at her red Camry.
She writes her number on the
back of a business card.
JERRY
But I mean really... wonderfully...
(out of steam)
great.
DOROTHY
(unsure)
Absolutely.
She climbs into her car, rolls down the window.
JERRY
And when you think about what
you've done later, don't panic.
41.
DOROTHY
Me?
No.
My sister -- it's a good
bet.
She starts the engine.
DOROTHY
(continuing)
That took guts.
JERRY
Same to you.
She salutes him as she drives off.
His own move, played back
to him.
Camera moves away from Jerry, as he stands alone in
the parking lot.
Salutes her in return.
Herb Alpert.
"The
Lonely Bull." Stripped of power, his once mighty theme now
seems puny.
FADE TO
Lights glow inside this small-but-cozy home on a side street
in Manhattan Beach. Windows open.
The sound of women's
voices.
Jerry exits car.
Adjusts the jacket.
Takes the tie off too,
returns to the car and tosses it inside.
He walks to the
front door with purpose.
Suddenly an intercom crackles,
jolting him with a booming and cheerful voice:
MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
No sports agents allowed!
Ha ha.
Jerry spots the small electronic camera pointed at him from
the upper-corner of this rustic home.
The door buzzes.
The headquarters for the NFL draft is buzzing with activity.
Limo doors open and out pours Maguire and company.
Media
lights flick on, bathing Cush.
Reporters chatter. ("Is it
San Diego or Denver, Cush?N
"Cush!")
Fans at the outskirts
are calling out to the young star ("Go get the big chi-ching,
Cush!") Avery smoothly pulls ESPN into the front position.
Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles. ("I'll either surf or
ski.")
Jerry admires his fiancee.
There is nothing more
attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job.
55.
Shot drifts off this media bubble to find Tidwell watching at
the outskirts.
He turns and exits unnoticed.
Jerry moves through the crowded airport with Rod Tidwell.
Both wear sunglasses.
TIDWELL
You love me now, don't you?
JERRY
Very much.
ON TV MONITOR -- ROY FIRESTONE
is leaning forward, expressively, talking with a weepy
athlete.
Dorothy finds Laurel on their small porch.
There is only
room for a miniature garden and one comfortable seat. Laurel
sits in it.
DOROTHY
He's coming over.
LAUREL
At eleven at night?
70.
DOROTHY
He just lost his best client.
He
called from the plane.
I invited
the guy over.
LAUREL
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This
is a "syndrome."
It's called
Early Midlife, About-To-Marry,
Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear-
God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll-
Call-My-Newly Long-suffering-
Assistant-Without Medical-For-
Company Syndrome.
And if, knowing
all that, you still allow him to
come over, more power to you.
DOROTHY
Honey, he's engaged.
And for the
first time in my professional
life, I'm a part of something I
believe in.
Dorothy exits.
Laurel shakes her head, calls to next room.
LAUREL
Okay, but he better not be good
looking!
Door opens to reveal Jerry Maguire with brown bag, shoulder
hang-up bag, disheveled hair and sunglasses.
JERRY
I'm Jerry Maguire.
LAUREL
(super pleasant)
You seem just the way I pictured
you. I'm her disapproving sister
Laurel.
JERRY
Honesty.
Thank you.
Now camera starts to move around the house, from this window
showing the two sisters in the laundry room, to the living
room where Jerry sits alone.
We see Ray wander into the room
and stare at Jerry.
Rod Tidwell races to catch up to a wobbly, overthrown pass.
He snags it out of the air, and moves gracefully downfield.
He turns back to shout at the quarterback for the wobbly
pass, and slams into a padding post.
Dennis Wilburn, the GM
we met earlier, crosses in front of Maguire, giving him a
look.
Maguire forges ahead anyway.
JERRY
We gotta talk about his contract,
Dennis.
WILBURN
Your timing is impeccable,
Maguire. Gee, I can't imagine how
you ever lost Cush...
81.
Wilburn moves on, scoffing loudly.
Jerry and Dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see
are parked on the street and the front lawn.
The sound of
the Women's group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind
them.
LAUREL
Hey!
As Jerry moves ahead to the car, Dorothy retreats so she can
have privacy with her sister.
LAUREL
(continuing)
Forgot your keys --
DOROTHY
(privately)
That's the first time I ever saw
him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't
that just... thrilling?
(eyes tear up)
I mean, he must have been needing
that.
Women's group laughter in the distance as Laurel attempts to
glue her emotional sister back together.
She holds her arm.
LAUREL
No no.
Don't cry at the beginning
of the date.
DOROTHY
(laughing, wiping
tear)
Oh, knock it off!
89.
LAUREL
(can't help it)
And don't be a shoulder for him to
cry on either.
We stay with Laurel as she watches her sister exit.
Music
continues.
Lit by streetlight, Dorothy runs like a young
girl, across the lawns of this car-filled neighborhood,
slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to Jerry down the
street.
Sbe exits the bathroom and stops at the sight of what is
happening at the table. Jerry, hand on face, is
embarrassingly being serenaded by the Mariachis, who now play
a mournful "Tears in Heaven."
She smiles at the image, in
fact the poetry charms her. Dorothy moves forward, grinning,
fishes some bucks out of her pocket, and sends the Mariachis
in another direction.
DOROTHY
Come on, let's take a walk.
Jerry on the porch, as Chad exits.
Chad now fully plays the
part of friend with seniority.
Looks the taller Jerry up and
down.
CHAD
Treat her right, man.
She's...
93.
JERRY
(self-conscious)
Yeah... well...
CHAD
She's great.
And I know this is
a little awkward, but I want you
to use this.
Chad ruumages in bag for a moment.
Jerry is somewhat
horrified at what Chad might be giving him.
Out comes a
cassette tape.
CHAD
(continuing; intense)
This... is Miles Davis and John
Coltrane. Stockholm.
1963... two
masters of freedom, playing in a
time before their art was
corrupted by a zillion cocktail
lounge performers who destroyed
the legacy of the only American
artform -- JAZZ.
Jerry takes the tape, as the front door squeaks open.
Dorothy shoos Chad away, quietly leads Jerry inside.
Tidwell and Marcee exit.
Dorothy and Jerry on the lawn.
JERRY
I'll get you some quick work --
TIDWELL
Good deal, man.
MARCEE
I'm sorry what I said back there.
JERRY
Don't be silly.
MARCEE
My husband believes in you.
We're
gonna make it.
Bye bye Dorothy.
DOROTHY
Take care you guys.
Tidwells exit.
Finally, Dorothy and Jerry are alone.
The
Tidwell situation has left an ominious feeling in the air.
DOROTHY
(continuing)
Look...
I was up for a job in San
Diego before I left SMI. It's with
the Chargers.
AIRPLANE WHEELS
touching down.
JERRY
Don't even talk about that yet.
I'll find something fast for
Tidwell. We'll stay afloat.
Tidwell stands on the set of a regional Arizona car
commercial. It is a hot day.
Three other bored, large
Arizona athletes wait by a coffee machine, as Jerry's friend,
director Bill Dooler appears ready to implode.
Dooler is
arguing with Tidwell.
101.
Maguire stands slightly away, acting as referee.
Nearby, a
camel.
DOOLER
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
JERRY
Bill, Rod, wait --
TIDWELL
Dude, know your art form.
If you
put the camera down here, looking
up, I look more powerful.
There's
no need for a camel... you got ME.
JERRY
Rod, get on the camel.
DOOLER
(shoots look to Jerry)
The sponsor wants a camel --
TIDWELL
Jerry, back me up.
It's either
the camel or me...
Tidwell waves his arms, spooking the camel, who spits and
stormps. Several crew members scatter in various directions.
JERRY
(takes the bullet)
Airight.
Enough.
I'm pulling him
out of this.
This isn't what I
had in mind anyway.
DOOLER
Then you shouldn't have begged me
to hire him.
Jerry and Tidwell walk quickly from the set.
In the
background, another athlete rides the camel.
TIDWELL
There you go, dude.
You're
learning how to represent me.
We
ain't gonna bring Nike to their
knees with some regional camel
ad --
Jerry rubs his face.
102.
JERRY
Can I ask you a question totally
unrelated to your career?
TIDWELL
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
JERRY
What do you know about dating a
single mother?
Tidwell warms to the personal question.
TIDWELL
Oh I know plenty.
I was raised by
a single mother.
JERRY
Tell me, because it's been a
month, and she's about to take
another job in San Diego.
Tidwell is always happy to hold forth.
TIDWELL
First, single mothers don't
"date." They have been to the
circus, you know what I'm saying?
They have been to the puppet show
and they have seen the strings.
You love her?
JERRY
How do I know?
TIDWELL
You know when you know.
It makes
you shivver, it eats at your
insides. You know?
JERRY
No, I don't know.
TIDWELL
Then you gotta have The Talk.
JERRY
But I sure don't like that she's
leaving.
TIDWELL
Well, that ain't fair to her.
A
single mother, that's a sacred
thing, man.
103.
JERRY
The kid is amazing.
TIDWELL
(shaking head)
No.
A real man does not shoplift
the "pooty" from a single mom.
JERRY
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."
We
were thrown together and -- I mean
it's two mutual people who --
(a look)
Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
TIDWELL
Shame on you.
SHAME on you.
A U-Haul is parked in the driveway.
Inside the cab, a very
sad Ray.
Jerry approaches carefully.
Ray does not look at
him.
He opens the door, scoots the kid over, and sits next
to him.
105.
Laurel and Dorothy say goodbye.
LAUREL
You're doing the right thing. I
mean, come on.
You need to start
your life and he... he needs a
warm body to cushion the fall.
Check out exhibit A on the front
lawn --
POV -- THE SISTERS
We see Jerry, following Chad back to the house, saying
goodbye too many times. He's anxious not to be left alone.
Finally Chad grabs him by the shoulders, says goodbye, as a
sad Ray trudges to the cab of the U-Haul.
Jerry now follows
Ray to the car.
Jerry scoots a very sad Ray over, and talks to him in the car.
JERRY
I'm not good at this.
Ray begins to cry. Jerry is incapable of dealing with it.
JERRY
(continuing)
I'll see you this weekend, okay?
Promise.
Ray wails.
Jerry squeezes his shoulder, it does nothing, so
he exits. He rises and faces Dorothy, keys in hand.
JERRY
(continuing)
Sure you're okay to drive this?
DOROTHY
This rig? Phht.
No problem.
JERRY
So I'll see you this weekend.
She accepts it casually, with a shrug.
DOROTHY
Airight, so goodbye and --
(simple, with shrug)
I love you.
Jerry blinks.
106.
JERRY
(too quick, weirdly)
... I love you too, you know.
She reacts with an odd look.
The words don't sound right,
and he knows that she knows.
JERRY
(continuing)
What --
DOROTHY
Look, just in case this weekend
becomes next month and next month
becomes... whatever...
(beat)
Don't make a joke of your life.
Go back and read what you wrote.
You're better than the rest of
them, better than the Bob Sugars,
and don't forget it.
He shudders a little with the intimacy of her words.
She
kisses him, and moves quickly toward the car, leaving him
alone in frame. He grows increasingly uncomfortable.
He
watches her leave.
JERRY
Wait a second.
ON DOROTHY
moving to her car.
She hears him.
It's not loud enough for
her.
JERRY
WAIT A SECOND!
She stops, smiling very slightly to herself , biting her lip.
She turns and he is now close to her.
JERRY
(continuing)
I know a way to s... to save on
Medical and rent and... look...
He grips one hand with the other.
Dorothy looks at his
strange behavior.
He looks over to the cab, where Ray is
making a sad face at him through the window.
JERRY
(continuing)
...
what if we stayed together?
What if we uh... got married.
107.
She looks at him.
It's an odd proposal.
JERRY
(continuing)
If I said that, would you stay?
DOROTHY
No no.
Don't do that.
Don't say
that if you don't...
JERRY
Will you marry me?
She looks at him, full of love, dabbing at her mascara.
Rod Tidwell sings Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On" at the
wedding for assorted guests gathered here in the backyard.
Contrary to his own belief, Rod is not a gifted singer.
In
the wedding band, standing on a small stage in the corner,
are Chad and Dooler.
ON JERRY
who stands watching, smile pasted on, with stoic FATHER and
well-dressed BROTHER.
BROTHER
Where are all your friends?
JERRY
(looking around)
In the band.
Tidwell catches the ball, takes a vicious hit. The season is
on.
Finally, here comes Tidwell, moving very slowly with garmet
bag.
JERRY
How's your head? Bubblicious.
110.
TIDWELL
Tidwell moves to a tan in a
wheelchair, signs an autograph and
moves on.
Jerry alongside. The
quarterback sucks, man.
He's
gonna get me killed.
JERRY
I'm a little worried --
TIDWELL
I'm worried too.
I'm worried that
the only reason I'm here getting
my brains blown loose is that you
weren't asshole enough to get my
ten million three months ago.
INSANE FAN
(interrupting loudly)
FUCKIN ROD TIDWELL YOU RULE YOU
RULE!
I WON A FUCKIN, A FUCKIN
MUG ON YOU IN MY ROTISS...
ROTLISS...
With great skill, Tidwell pats the fan and moves him along to
other tired players.
TIDWELL
Peace, my drunken brother.
Ahd
don't discuss gambling with me.
Insane fan moves to another player.
Jerry proceeds carefully.
JERRY
We can still take the offer, Rod.
TIDWELL
(stops)
No.
Jerry regards his slightly befuddled friend.
JERRY
Well, just stay healthy. I will
show you the kwan.
TIDWELL
(irritated)
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Tidwell wearily heads for the bus.
Jerry stands in the
parking lot.
JERRY
I'll see you in Arizona.
111.
TIDWELL
I'm gonna have the game of my life
on Monday Night Football, and show
all these motherfuckers.
JERRY
Take care, okay? You're my entire
client roster.
TIDWELL
Don't I know.
Now go home to your
wife.
JERRY
What's that supposed to mean?
TIDWELL
Why are you even here, man? You
could have told me all this over
the phone.
JERRY
I don't know -- how's "dedication"
for an answer?
TIDWELL
You don't want to go home, do you?
JERRY
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
TIDWELL
I'm asking you a question --
JERRY
No, you're --
TIDWELL
I'm trying to talk to you.
How's
your marriage?
Jerry looks at Rod for a moment.
It is the simplest
question, and one in which he has no quick answer.
JERRY
Not everyone has what you have.
TIDWELL
Then why'd you get married?
I'm
asking you as a friend.
JERRY
(shaking his head)
You're jabbing at me.
112.
TIDWELL
I'm sorry I asked.
JERRY
No, I'm going to answer you.
You
want an answer?
I'll give it to
you.
(beat)
Loyalty.
She was loyal.
(unconvincing)
Everything grew from there.
TIDWELL
That's an answer.
JERRY
Damn right.
TIDWELL
(jab)
For loyalty, you buy a dog.
For
love, you get married.
JERRY
Look.
I'm happy to entertain you,
as always, but I have a question
for you.
Are we really "friends?"
TIDWELL
Why not --
JERRY
Well, friends can tell each other
anything, right? If we have our
"friends" hats on --
TIDWELL
(wary)
I think so.
JERRY
(intense)
Airight.
Here's why you don't
have your ten million dollars yet.
You are a paycheck player.
You
play with your head.
Not your
heart.
In your personal life?
(points)
Heart. But when you get on the
field --
(more)
113.
JERRY (cont'd)
(finger rises to
Tidwell's head)
-- you're a businessman.
It's
wide-angle lenses and who fucked
you over and who owes you for it.
That's not what inspires people.
I'm sorry, but that's the truth,
can you handle it? Just a
"question," Rod.
Between friends.
TIDWELL
I don't want to be friends anymore.
JERRY
Fine.
TIDWELL
Beautiful.
JERRY
(angry)
We still having dinner in L.A.?
TIDWELL
(anqry)
Only 'cause my wife likes your
wife!
Jerry exits.
Tidwell is pissed.
And hurt.
TIDWELL
(continuing)
"No heart."
"No heart?"
(yells after him)
I'm all heart, motherfucker!
He gets on the bus.
Dorothy drops Ray at preschool, and stands in the doorway of
the playroom.
She watches the boys and girls playing
together in a room full of bright colors and games.
Music.
Anxiety building.
116.
Jerry sits finishing a phone call to an advertising account
exec. He has come here, to Ray's playhouse for privacy.
JERRY
Tonight.
Yeah, the red-eye, I'll
be in Arizona on Monday...
Jerry adlibs some salesmanship on Tidwell's behalf.
Dorothy
approaches.
She gives him a few phone messages, sits down.
Beat of silence.
He sees a look on her face that is
unfamiliar.
DOROTHY
It's my fault.
JERRY
What --
DOROTHY
It's not fair to you.
This
whole --
JERRY
(instant crisis mode)
Tell me -- let me help --
DOROTHY
I took advantage of you and worst
of all, I'm not alone. I did this
with a kid.
I was just on some
ride where I thought I was in 1ove
enough for both of us.
I did
this.
And at least I can do
something about it now.
JERRY
(damage control)
Well -- I'm not the guy who's
going to run.
I stick.
DOROTHY
I don't need you to "stick."
JERRY
You want...
DOROTHY
I don't know --
JERRY
(it slips out)
...my soul or something.
117.
DOROTHY
Why fucking not!
I deserve it.
JERRY
(direct)
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not
built that way?
DOROTHY
I think we made a mistake here.
But now he can't stop.
JERRY
What if it's true?
"Great at
friendship bad at intimacy." I
mean, come on.
It's the theme of
my bachelor film --
DOROTHY
I know.
I watched it.
I sort of
know it by heart.
JERRY
(absorbs it)
I don't like to give up.
DOROTHY
Oh please.
My need to make the
best of things, and your need to
be what, "responsible"... if one
of us doesn't say something now we
might lose ten years being polite
about it. Why don't we call this
next road trip what it is.
A nice
long break.
JERRY
What about Ray?
She notes the only real glimpse of ache, in that question.
DOROTHY
There's no question you'll be
friends. Of course you'll be
friends.
JERRY
So this break... is a break-up.
DOROTHY
Come on, Jerry.
You know this
isn't easy for me.
(more)
118.
DOROTHY (cont'd)
I mean, on the surface, you'd
almost think everything was fine.
See, I've got this great guy who
loves my kid --
(resolute, no tears)
-- and he sure does like me a lot.
Jerry Maguire, a man who speaks for a living, has nothing to
say.
DOROTHY
(continuing)
I can't live that way.
It's not
the way I'm "built."
He moves to embrace her.
She pulls away first.
We are hovering in the sky, just above Sun Devil Stadium.
The classic Monday Night Football shot from the blimp.
We are thrust into the vortex, inside the game.
Tidwell lies
still on turf.
Overhead, the fight music continues for a few
seconds before disappearing abruptly. Players and coaches
begin to gather around the still body of Rod Tidwell.
TV MONITOR -- SLO-MO
The hit in replay.
It is brutal.
And we can see a flash of
his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then... like two
bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side.
One
cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body
literally flips.
The second defender then hits him at the
shoulders.
Tidwell lands on the back of his neck, crumpling
downwards.
Still holding the ball.
Still.
Jerry Maguire on the portable.
JERRY
He took a shot.
He's unconscious.
MARCEE
I'm freakin out.
Oh God I'm --
JERRY
Keep the phone open.
I'll call
back. Stay calm. He's got some
good doctors out there.
MARCEE
"Stay calm?"
I'm freakin...
JERRY
Alright, I'm freaking too.
But
they need you to stay calm.
I'll
call back.
124.
MARCEE
My whole life is this family,
Jerry. It doesn't work without him.
She takes a big gulp, as Jerry watches an overzealous Trainer
run out onto the field to join the cluster around the fallen
Tidwell. Jerry covers phone and yells onto the field.
JERRY
DON'T TOUCH HIM!!!
We're now just a few inches in front of his peaceful,
sleeping face.
They are all. YELLING, trying to pull him out.
SHOTS OF NATIONAL TELEVISION AUDIENCES
1)
A full sports bar in arizona silently watches Monday
Night Football.
2)
Generic living room of sports fans, all watching Tidwell
pinned to the screen.
3)
Generic outdoor bar-b-que as white fans watch t.V.
4)
Tidwell living room.
All gathered around the television.
5)
Maguire straining at the sideline.
ON TIDWELL -- CLOSE
Dead to the world as sound disappears. There is now only
silence.
POV TIDWELL - SLO-MO -- SILENCE
The Doctors and the Trainers are now truly panicked.
We
don't hear them.
We see them, their motions increasingly
manic. Shoving fingers in front of him.
Screaming.
We read
their lips.
("Rod!" "Rod can you hear us!")
We see the
anguish and escalating fear on their faces.
The Trainer
leans in close, bellowing, he spreads his hands wide to clap
right in front of Rod's still face.
His hands head toward
each other... closer... bringing with them the first inkling
of sound...
getting closer and then finally coming together,
bringing with him the sounds of the stadium.
ON TIDWELL
who blinks back to life.
Concerned men are yelling very
loudly, right in his face.
Tidwell becomes aware he is the
absolute center of attention of the entire stadium.
As crowd
noise begins to rise.
125.
TRAINER
Let's get you off the field!
TIDWELL
Wait.
TRAINER
Can you feel your legs?
TIDWELL
Yeah.
Just let me enjoy this for
a minute.
ON JERRY
who watches.
Only marginally relieved.
Is he okay?
ON FANS
Crowd noise rises.
Is he okay?
ON TIDWELL
Can he move?
Is he okay?
ON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM
Not a breath is taken.
Is he okay?
He rises.
Stadium explodes.
At first on wobbly feet, he
raises the football and for the first time -- salutes the
crowd.
Crowd noise doubles.
ON MAGUIRE
gasping for breath.
ON TIDWELL
Has never felt like this before in his life.
It is the pure
and absolute love of the spotlight.
And his fans.
And then... it's real and he feels it.
Tidwell breaks out in
a small but unmistakable move -- a flutter step.
He does a
high-stepping move, all his own, for about ten yards.
ON JERRY MAGUIRE
who watches, now in complete disbelief. Tidwell will not let
go of the spotlight.
ON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM
Going absolutely nuts.
Marcee hysterical, laughing and
crying.
126.
MARCEE
(to Tee Pee)
You ain't talking now, are you???
You're a silent motherfucker!
Tyson watches in silent awe of his mother.
BACK ON TIDWELL -- CLOSE
Finishes his small but heartfelt dance.
It is a personal
catharsis he is sharing now with 2 billion people.
TIDWELL
(to himself)
Nike.
He moves past Jerry Maguire on his way off the field. Jerry,
casually thumps his heart twice. Jerry Maguire is overcome
with emotion.
He sits down on a camera case, head in his
hands.
Behind him, a stadium cheers a new hero.
OVERHEARD FAN
I always knew he was great.
Maguire rubs his face.
Overcome. Photographers and others
rush past to be closer to Tidwell.
Jerry exits cab, holding hang-up bag.
Looks at the house.
On the other side of that window is a world he hopes he's
still a part of.
Jerry, Dorothy, Ray exit into the daylight.
They walk to
Jerry's car. From across the fence, a stray baseball from a
pick-up game flies into the parking lot and bounces ahead of
them.
Ray picks it up. In an easy fluid motion, he whips it
back over the fence to the game on the other side.
A few
kids on the other side of the fence shout their approval of
a great little throw.
132.
Jerry and Dorothy stop, looking at Ray who has just shown
shocking natural ability.
They are quiet for a moment,
turning slowly to look at each other.
And then, not ready to
deal with it, not even close to ready to deal with it, they
say quickly to the boy:
JERRY
DOROTHY
Come on, Ray.
Ray, let's go.
Happily Ray joins them as they walk to the car.
A family.
Music.
FADE OUT
THE END
