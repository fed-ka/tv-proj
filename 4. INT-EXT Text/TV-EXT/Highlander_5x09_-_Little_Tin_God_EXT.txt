      SUPER: TWO MONTHS AGO

      A modest church, well kept and warmly lit.  The strains of
      a Gospel Choir drift out onto the street:

                                            GOSPEL CHOIR (O.S.)
                        Every time I feel the spirit
                        Moving in my heart I will pray...



      Reverend Bell stands at the top of the stairs in the open
      door as Derek heads out.  Derek bounces down the stairs,
      waves back at the Rev, then turns down the dark street.

      He doesn't notice

      A CAR

      Pulling out from the curb.  Dark and ominous, its windows
      tinted.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96508  "Little Tin God"       3.      Final Shooting Script 9/9/96

      TRACKING - FROM INSIDE THE CAR

      It speeds up, pulling alongside Derek.  The window slides
      down.  Derek is centered in the open window.

      STREET - RESUME

      The car paces alongside Derek.

      ON THE CAR

      As little explosions light the corner of the window --
      GUNSHOTS.

      REVEREND BELL

      At the top of the stairs.  Reacts in horror to the sound
      of gunfire.

      DEREK

      Goes down, hit.

      BELL

      Races toward Derek as

      THE CAR

      Speeds up and pulls away.  As it does, Bell sees

      LARCA

      In the window.  A single image of Derek's killer -- Bell
      will never forget it.

      BELL

      Goes to his knees by Derek's body, a cry of anguish on his
      lips.

                                            BELL
                        Oh, Lord, no...  No...

      GOSPEL WAILING carries us to --





      MacLeod is out jogging in the woods.  He's worked up a
      well-earned sweat and is ready to call it quits.  He veers
      towards the road where his car is parked.  As he approaches,
      he feels the BUZZ.  He slows to a halt.

      LUKE

      An Immortal, 24, is waiting by the car.  He's clean-cut,
      cocky, and built like a football player.  And he holds a
      sword, raised and ready.

      MACLEOD

      Circles warily, eyeing Luke -- and Luke's blade.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Duncan MacLeod.

                                            LUKE
                        I know who you are.

      And with no more warning than that, Luke charges.  MACLEOD
      dodges, rolls out of the way.

      LUKE

      Is big and powerful, but not well trained -- he overswings. 

      MACLEOD

      sweeps Luke's legs out from under him.

      LUKE

      Goes down.

      MACLEOD

      Scrambles to the T-Bird, reaches in for his katana.  He
      gets his hand on it, his body extended across the seat,
      neck vulnerable, when suddenly his eyes go wide as he gets
      ANOTHER BUZZ.

      He spins, bringing the katana up as he does, barely in
      time to block the sword swinging for his neck.  The blade
      glances off as MacLeod finds himself facing

      DEREK

      sweating from nerves, his first time in battle.  Behind
      him, Luke has regained his feet.

      MacLeod is battle ready, sword raised, looking back and
      forth between his two young opponents.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You can't do this.

      No answer.  Instead, they both close on him.

                                            MACLEOD
                        This is against the rules!

                                            DEREK
                        Rules?  This isn't a game

      DEREK

      Swings.

      MACLEOD

      Ducks the blade, comes up underneath it, body-checking
      Derek.

      DEREK

      Hits the ground, winded.  His sword goes flying.

      MACLEOD

      Turns to face Luke as he feels A THIRD BUZZ.  And before
      MacLeod can react

      A BOLA

      Flies out of the woods, tangles around his ankles.

      MACLEOD

      Is down.  He looks up to see

      DEREK

      On his feet again, Luke, and newcomer ENRIQUE (25, Peruvian,
      with a hard, determined look) closing on him.

      Individually, none of them would stand a chance.  3-on-1,
      MacLeod isn't so sure.





                                                                (CONTINUED)96508  "Little Tin God"       8.      Final Shooting Script 9/9/96



806CONTINUED: (2)806

      MACLEOD

      quickly slices through the cords of the bola, freeing his
      legs, and rolls to his feet as the young fighters approach. 
      He takes their measure -- bulky Luke, implacable Enrique,
      and tense, jumpy Derek -- and picks his battle.  He feints
      toward Luke, then turns and runs over Derek.



      MacLeod runs for it through the trees.

      FOLLOWING

      The three young Immortals chase after him.

                                            ENRIQUE
                        Split up!  Get around him!

      Luke and Derek angle off.

      ON MACLEOD

      Running.

      MACLEOD'S POV

      Through the trees, he spots the STEEPLE of a roadside
      church.  He heads for it.

      ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - DEREK

      Moves carefully through the trees, sword out, tense.  He's
      singing quietly to calm himself, the song from the Teaser:

                                            DEREK
                        Every time I feel the spirit    
                        Moving in my heart I will pray.

      MACLEOD

      Steps out from behind a tree, katana drawn.

                                            MACLEOD
                            (dry)
                        You know "Rock of Ages"?

      MacLeod doesn't give Derek time to recover his wits.  He
      knocks Derek's sword aside and backs him against a tree,
      katana to the young Immortal's throat.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Who are you?

807CONTINUED:807

      Derek's answer is shaky, his throat dry, his fear and
      confusion obvious.

                                            DEREK
                        An angel of the Lord.

      MacLeod doesn't know what to make of this, but there's no
      time to pursue it.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Sure you are.

      He grabs Derek and drags him bodily toward --



      A small structure by the roadside.  Only in use for an
      hour on Sundays, now it's shuttered.  MacLeod hauls Derek
      out of the woods in a hammer lock, hustling him across the
      lawn.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Move.



      MacLeod arrives, dragging the struggling Derek with him.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Sit!
                              (Derek does)
                        Now you're going to tell me what
                        this is all about.

      Derek cowers, lips moving in prayer.

                                            DEREK
                        Yea, though I walk through the valley
                        of the shadow of death...  I will
                        fear no evil, for Thou art with me.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (frustrated)
                        I'm not going to hurt you.

                                            DEREK
                              (louder)
                        Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort 
                        me.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Will you stop!

      Derek stops his prayer.

      MacLeod stares at him.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You really have no idea what you
                        are?

                                            DEREK
                        I told you.

      MacLeod reacts.  Now he's seen everything.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Right.  You're an angel and that
                        makes me what?

                                            DEREK
                        You know what you are, Satan.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I'm the Devil?  You actually believe
                        that.
                              (beat)
                        Tell me, bright eyes, why would the
                        Devil take you to holy ground?

      Before Derek can answer, they get the BUZZ again.  MacLeod
      turns as Enrique and Luke coming running in, sweating and
      out of breath, their swords out.

                                            MACLEOD
                        So are you guys with Charlie's Angels
                        or the California Angels?

      Enrique raises his blade.

                                            ENRIQUE
                        It's time to send you back to Hell.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Put up your sword.  This is Holy

                        You can't do this.

      They keep coming.

      As if on cue, they all feel the BUZZ.  MacLeod turns as
      Larca steps in behind him.  He wears the same linen robe
      as we saw before, his hair flowing and saint-like.

                                            LARCA

      MacLeod looks from the three young Immortals to Larca. 
      Cold recognition.

      MacLeod is with his guide, PACO, 40's.  They're exploring
      the deep jungle, the sound of Peruvian pipes and rain forest
      birds filling the air.  Paco is sweating.  He stops to
      drink.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Are you all right?

                        A touch of fever.  It's nothing that
                          a night's sleep on a soft bed won't
                        cure.

      The calls of the birds fall suddenly SILENT.  MacLeod
        straightens, alert.  He puts a hand on Paco's shoulder to
      stop him.

      MacLeod points ahead.

      MACLEOD'S POV

      Two fiercely painted warriors emerge from the bush.  They
      aim slim longbows notched with six-foot arrows directly at
      the explorers' chests.

      RESUME

      Paco's eyes narrow, never leaving the native warriors.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What tribe?

                              (shaking his head)
                        They shouldn't be here.

                        No, we shouldn't be here.

      Paco leans back into MacLeod, slowly pulling out his knife:

                                            PACO

                        I don't think so.

                                            PACO
                        There's only two of them.

                                            MACLEOD
                        That you can see.

      Another half-dozen warriors seemingly materialize out of
      the bush on either side, their wickedly barbed arrowheads
      pointed right at the explorers' hearts.



      In the center, an ancient Moche temple.  It is still
      inspiring after centuries of deterioration.  MacLeod and
      Paco are led by ropes tied around their necks, their hands
      lashed behind their backs and most of their clothing
      removed.  They're uncomfortably hot, flinching from insect
      bites.

      They are brought to the center of the village.  Wary
      villagers, suspicious of strangers, begin to surround them,
      taunting and spitting.

      MacLeod tries to elicit a response in Spanish:

                                            MACLEOD
                        Habla Espa ol?  Habla Espa ol?

      No response.  He tries Portuguese:

                                            MACLEOD
                        Fala Portugues?  Fala Portugues?

      Still nothing.  He tries an Indian dialect:

                                            MACLEOD
                          Quechua?  Quechua?
                              (beat; to himself)
                        You watch: they'll all speak English.

      Then, the BUZZ.  MacLeod tenses -- he's in no position to
      defend himself.

      LARCA

      Emerges from the temple, dressed in king-like finery, draped
      in gold and silver -- truly a vision of Moche splendor.

      At his side, his wife, the exquisite COYANTU, 22.

      The villagers pull back from the prisoners, an act of
      respect to the approaching Larca.  The two Immortals take o
      ne another's measure.  MacLeod is painfully aware that t
      his is not a match set on equal footing.

      Larca raises his arm, majestically, pointing to MacLeod:

                                            LARCA
                          Rimasun.
                              ("Bring him forward")

      Warriors roughly push MacLeod forward and shove him down
      onto his knees.

      He looks up at Larca, his face proud:

                                            MACLEOD
                        I am Duncan MacLeod of the clan
                          MacLeod.

                        the Moche people.

      Off MacLeod's reaction we --



      MACLEOD'S POV

      Bound, yelling and cursing, Paco is being dragged toward
      another part of the village by a group of chanting
      villagers.  The dais is surrounded by the villagers
        rhythmically chanting faster and faster.



      AT THE CEREMONIAL SITE

        a still-struggling Paco is roughly laid on the altar.

      LARCA

      In his most splendid ceremonial garb, steps up to the altar. 
      He raises a CUTLASS high into the air, wickedly sharp and
      glistening.  The chanting reaches a peak, Paco screams at
      the top of his lungs --

                                            PACO
                        NO! 96508  "Little Tin God"       19.      Final Shooting Script 9/9/96





      MacLeod faces Larca.

                                            MACLEOD
                            (to the three young
                              Immortals)
                        He's not God!  You're Immortals.
                        We're all Immortals.

      Larca simply smiles, infuriatingly calm.

                                            LARCA
                        Say what you will.  They know the
                        Devil lies.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I am not the Devil and you're not
                        God.  Not then, not now.

      Larca gestures to his Disciples.

                                            LARCA
                        Leave us.  I will speak to the Evil
                        one in private.

                        It is my Will.

                        His power is no greater than yours.

      Obedient, Enrique and Luke sheath their swords, and go out
      the door.  Derek hesitates, then follows.

                                            MACLEOD

      MacLeod takes up the challenge, steps closer to Larca.

                        I've waited 150 years for this.  You
                          destroyed everything I built,

      An unkempt chapel on the edge of an old disused cemetery.





      The FEVER has descended upon the village.  Funeral pyres
      burn with ghastly brightness.  An endless stream of linen-
      wrapped corpses are dragged to the flames and tossed in.

      VILLAGERS' FACES reflect their disease-and misery.  OTHERS
      are angry, staring and pointing at:

      LARCA'S HUT

      Larca stands at the doorway, a regal but sullen purveyor
      of his dying faithful.  Coyantu keeps herself slightly
      apart from him, her face hidden in shadow.

                                            COYANTU
                        Are we all going to die, my Lord?

                                            LARCA

                        open up with my miracle.

                        Please, my Lord.  Don't wait.  So
                        many have been lost already.  So

                                            COYANTU
                        No, my Lord.  I beg you.  If it is
                        your will, heal us.

      She steps into the light, her face is pale, she is sweating
      profusely.

                                            COYANTU
                        Heal me.

      Larca reacts to the realization that she, too, is ill.  He
      strokes her beautiful long hair, tears in his eyes.

                                            LARCA
                        It shall be so.  I swear it.



      MacLeod tumbles out of the back of Larca's hut and runs
      for his life as the people of the village follow.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

                        them with great vengeance and furious
                        anger those who attempt to poison
                        and destroy thy brothers."

      As he moves toward the church, we see he carries a .357
      Magnum in one hand, and a MACHETE in the other.



      MacLeod's car drives toward Larca's place.



      MacLeod pulls up in his car.  He jumps out and strides to
      the chapel.



      Derek leads Reverend Bell by the arm.  Luke lays down
      Enrique's body.  Larca walks ominously behind.

                                            BELL
                        Derek, don't do this.

                                            DEREK
                            (a whisper)
                        I'm sorry.

      They all wait tensely.

                                            LARCA
                        You did well, Derek.  You proved
                          yourself my faithful servant.

      Larca walks over to Enrique's inert body.

                                            LARCA
                        Enrique gave his life in my service. 
                        He will be rewarded.

      Larca claps a hand over Enrique's chest where the bullets
      hit, and waits.

                                            LARCA
                        Live again, my son.  Your God commands
                        it.

      Enrique's eyes flutter.  He grabs his chest, sits up in
      shock.  Larca turns on Luke.

                                            LARCA
                        As for you.  You failed me when I
                        needed you most.  You lost your faith.

      Luke begins to back away, scared.

                                            LUKE
                        I couldn't help it.

                                            LARCA
                              (raising his hand)
                          Silence!
                              (beat)
                        Kneel before me.

      Luke is breathing hard, scared.  But he does as he's told
      and kneels.  Larca turns his back towards him and pulls
      out his sword.

                                            LARCA
                        I shall cleanse you of your sin.

                                            LUKE
                              (relieved)
                        Thank you.



      MacLeod comes out of the chapel.  The Quickening lights
      the sky above the nearby field.

      MacLeod takes off at a run toward the light show.



      Derek and Enrique watch, stunned, as the last bolt of light
      sputters into Larca.  He rises, his face suffused with an
        otherworldly satisfaction.  Steps toward Bell, who's on
      his knees, praying.

                                            LARCA
                            (to Derek)
                        Step away from the preacher.

      The pit of Derek's stomach suddenly fills with dread.  He
      hesitates.

                                            LARCA
                        I said step away.

      Larca raises Bell's gun, aims at Bell.

                                            DEREK
                        No..!

                                            LARCA
                        It is written.  "Thou shalt have no
                        other Gods before me."
                            (in a rage)
                        Step aside, Derek, I command it!

      Pause.  Derek is about to explode with his inner conflict.

                                            LARCA
                              (booming)
                          I command it!!

      Larca shoves Derek aside roughly and raises the gun.

                                            BELL
                            (to Larca and Derek)
                        May God have mercy on you both.

                                            LARCA
                              (shrill)
                        I am God!!

      He's about to pull the trigger when he gets the BUZZ.  He
      turns as

      MACLEOD

      Tackles him.  The gun goes flying.

      MacLeod pulls Bell hastily to his feet, gives him a shove
      toward:

                                            MACLEOD
                        Get back on Holy Ground!  Now!

      As Bell stumbles toward the cemetery and safety, MacLeod
      turns to face Larca.  He finds himself facing

      THREE IMMORTALS WITH SWORDS

      Larca is flanked by his two remaining disciples.

      Larca smiles.  He smells victory.

                                            LARCA
                          Enrique, Derek...
                              (indicating MacLeod)
                        Serve me well.

      MacLeod holds his katana at the ready, his eyes darting
      between his three opponents.  This will be the fight of
      his life.  Then --

      DEREK

      Hesitates a moment, then steps up beside Enrique.  He puts
      his blade to Enrique's throat.

                                            DEREK
                            (to Enrique)
                        Put it down.

                                            LARCA
                        What are you doing?

                                            DEREK
                        If you're God, you don't need us.

      Enrique hesitates.

                                            DEREK
                        I told you once.

      He uses the butt of his blade to knock Enrique unconscious,
      then kicks his sword away.  MacLeod acknowledges with a
      nod.  Then, to Larca:

                                            MACLEOD
                        By the rules, this time.  You and
                        me.

      Larca raises his sword.

                                            LARCA
                            (with hatred)
                        Because of you, my people died.
                        Because of you they turned on me.
                              (beat)
                        I was entombed for 150 years.

      Larca attacks.  He fights with a ferocity that speaks of
      long-held rage and hatred.

                                            LARCA
                        And all I dreamed about was this
                        moment.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Keep dreaming.

      Larca's good, fighting with passion and skill, but MacLeod
      matches him blow for blow, tiring him.  It enrages Larca.

                                            LARCA
                        I am God!

                                            MACLEOD
                              (mocking him)
                          I thought you'd be taller.

      He comes at MacLeod with a wild slash which MacLeod gets
      under.  And once he's inside Larca's guard, it's all over. 
      Larca's body falls.

      The Quickening lights up the field like a magnetic wave
      across the rough-stubbled ground, heaving up into a huge
      burst of lightning and thunder.

      MACLEOD

      Is buffeted by the storm that is Larca.

      DEREK

      Watches in awe.  As the Quickening subsides

      ENRIQUE

      Takes advantage of Derek's distraction to pull free, and
      scramble for his sword.  He stands with the blade in his
      hand as MacLeod rises from the Quickening.  MacLeod's eyes,
      still shining with exertion, bore into Enrique.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I have no fight with you.  Unless
                        you make one.

      The katana is at the ready.  Enrique considers a beat --
      he just saw how good MacLeod is.  With a last dark glare,
      he turns and runs off.

      As MacLeod stands looking after him, looking like some
      ancient warrior on a hilltop, sword still in hand, Derek
      steps up to him.

                                            DEREK
                        Forgive me.

      He starts to go to one knee.  MacLeod stops him, meets his
      eyes.

                                            MACLEOD
                        There are no gods here, Derek.  I'm
                        an Immortal, just like you.  You'll
                        have to learn what that means.  But
                        it doesn't mean we're gods.
                            (a look at Larca's
                              body)
                        Not now, not ever.

      And off this --

                                                                              FADE OUT.
