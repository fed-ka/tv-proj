      Near dawn, sky threatening rain.  CAMERA TRACKS behind a
      lone WOMAN running through a maze of stark trees.  Breathing
      hard, pushing herself to the limit, sweatshirt soaked through. 
      At first you wonder if she's a young girl with her ponytail,
      small frame, and then you see her eyes -- wounded, haunted -
      and realize she isn't.  Meet Homicide Detective SARAH LINDEN -
      37, lone wolf type, solo distance runner, pretty without
      trying, her smiles rare, her intense eyes strange, unblinking.

      CAMERA TRACKS past, lifting towards the sky.  SMASH CUT TO --


      Tree limbs, like long fingers, reach down towards a young
      girl -- 17, sweet-faced, child-woman's body -- running hard,
      clothing torn, dirty blonde hair soaked with sweat.  With
      blood.  This is ROSIE LARSEN and she is running for her life.

      Crashing through the brush behind her, an UNSEEN ASSAILANT
      closes in, FLASHLIGHT illuminating Rosie's terrified,
      bloodshot eyes, the bruises and cuts on her arms, legs, face. 
      In the distance, the SOUND of an approaching train.  Ahead,
      what looks like a break in the woods.  With a strangled cry,
      Rosie plunges towards it--


      Dawn.  Sarah bursts into a clearing, stopping on a railroad
      track, SOUND of an approaching train in the distance.  She
      leans over, gulping cold air, sweat pouring down her face.

      Beyond, down a small embankment, is an abandoned beach strewn
      with driftwood, fog.  In the distance, the snow-capped
      Olympics loom over the frigid waters of the Puget Sound.

      Sarah looks up, goes still.  A FIGURE lies on the beach.  A
      blanket of loopy seaweed covering it.  Gnats and flies buzzing
      over it.  SMASH CUT TO --


      Rosie bursts into the nighttime clearing, tripping, scrambling
      on hands and knees down a small embankment.  The flashlight
      behind her jaggedly cuts through the woods, nearing.  In the
      far distance, the train's horn sounds, eerie, sonorous.

      Rosie crouches in a small pool of brackish water, pressing
      herself into the embankment, making herself as small as
      possible.  Flashlight flits over her head, then moves off.                                                                                          2.

        A breathless beat.  Rosie shakily rises.  The Assailant is
      gone.  The train horn, still distant but closer now, sounds.

      Rosie's face is suddenly flooded with light.  The Assailant
      has doubled back and is now only a dozen yards away.  Moving
      in with terrifying speed.  With a scream, Rosie runs--


      Sarah, transfixed, nears the bloated figure on the sand. 
      The buzzing of flies and gnats louder now. 

      As the train horn blasts, unrelenting, she reaches down,
      pulls off the blanket of seaweed. 

      It is a SEA LION -- swollen and dead -- one black eye staring
      up at her.  The train thunders past.

      CAMERA PUSHES IN to an ECU on the dead sea lion's milky eye --
      blank, somehow knowing.  Sarah -- distorted -- reflected in
      it.  Even here, on this beach, she is unable to escape these
      broken bodies.  And the exhausting knowledge: life doesn't
      care.  It is indifferent.

      Suddenly, Sarah's CELL PHONE RINGS, startling her--

                                      SARAH
                          (into phone)
                    Linden here.

      Off this--


      Industrial docks of downtown Seattle.  In the distance,
      through the now heavy rain, the Space Needle, the gray
      downtown skyline, the waters of Lake Union, all under a
      breathtaking, brooding sky.  A city of contrasts, light and
      dark, sun and fog, where rain falls eight months of the year. 
      A city surrounded on all sides by waterways, ocean, lakes. 
      Stark beauty and dark underbelly.

      Still in her sweats, Sarah exits her car, chomping GUM,
      humping through the rain.  A UNIFORM guards the entrance of
      an abandoned factory, keeping a bunch of LOOKIE LOOS -- sullen
      emo teens and a bug-eyed crackhead -- at bay.

      Badging him, Sarah ducks under the crime scene TAPE.  Met by
      a SARGEANT -- 40s, grizzled, ex-boxer's battered face--

                                      SARGEANT
                    Bout time you got here.

                                      SARAH
                    Viaduct's a bitch this morning. 
                    Whaddya got?                                                                                          3.

                                      SARGEANT
                    White female, from what I can tell. 
                    No ID.  Homeless guy found her coupla
                    hours ago.

                                      SARAH
                    Decomp?

                                      SARGEANT
                    Nah, fresh one.  Someone did a real
                    number on her.

      Sarah glances over at the Lookie Loos.  One of them -- male,
      pierced, baleful -  stares back.

                                      SARGEANT (CONT'D)
                    Think he wants a date, Sarah?

                                      SARAH
                    Your type, go for it.

      She holds the Lookie Loo's stare, then drops her eyes. 
      Exhausted suddenly.  Deeply sick of this shit.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Coroner do Jane Doe yet?

                                      SARGEANT
                    Nah, he's en route.  You're first on
                    the scene.  Body's in the basement.

      He nods to the open freight elevator door, Sarah steps in.

                                      SARGEANT (CONT'D)
                    Want me to walk you through?

                                      SARAH
                    No, I got it.

      He tosses her a roll of BAGGIES.

                                      SARGEANT
                    You outa here next week, right? 
                    Last day Friday?

      She punches a button and the doors begin to close --

                                      SARAH
                    Nope.  Today.

      The doors CLANG shut--


      The waterway connecting Lake Union with the vast Puget Sound. 
      Seagulls dive and soar above the dark water, their cries
      eerie, echoing.  PRELAP VO: "Jack?  Jack?!..."


      An old, weathered federal building in downtown Seattle.  The
      American flag at its front.  Pouring rain--


      Sarah drives, Holder yaks.  Squat factories -- abandoned,
        graffiti-marred -- sliding past their windows.

                                      HOLDER
                    ... Worked county narcotics eight
                    years, mostly undercover.

                                      SARAH
                          (no shit)
                    You?  A UC?  Never woulda guessed.

      Holder shoots her a look: whatevs.

                                      HOLDER
                    Mostly street level buys and busts,
                    Joaquim shooting Rakim, blah blah. 
                    War on drugs a hot crock o' shit.

                                      SARAH
                    And you think Homicide's gonna be
                      different?

                                      HOLDER
                    Least you got a bad guy.

      They stop at a light.  Through Holder's window, a TEEN RUNAWAY --
      16, male, filthy dreads, kindly face -- slouches numbly
      against a monstrous duffel bag on the sidewalk.  Rain
      drizzling down.

      Holder presses two fingers against the glass: "Peace".  The
      Teen Runaway lazily sticks up his middle finger: "Fuck you".

      Holder grins, gives him the finger back.  They pull away.                                                                                        14.

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                    Punk ass.

                                      SARAH
                    They hate us, you know.

                                      HOLDER
                    Ya think?

                                      SARAH
                    That kid, Picasso, sat with his dead
                    Mom in that crap motel?  Turns out
                    it was Dad who sliced her.  I put
                    him away.  Twenty to life.

      Holder turns to look at her.  Most she's spoken in awhile. 
      She stares straight ahead into the rain.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Thing is, kid's got no other family,
                    right?  So now, he's stuck in some
                    foster home, his second, third,
                    whatever, no end in sight.  Six years
                    old, murdered hooker for a mom... no
                    one's adopting him.  Damaged goods
                    for life.  Grows up to be some kid
                    on the street.  Another punk ass.

      She stops the car.  They're at Discovery Park.  Outside the
      windows: trees, a lonely fire road, a field.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    So you tell me.  Who's the bad guy?

      She exits.  Holder watches her go for a beat, then follows.


        A scattering of UNIFORMS in a desolate field, woods in the
      near distance.  Rain abated for now.

      Sarah and Holder approach a young, bored UNIFORM in charge--

                                      SARAH
                    Where's the body?

                                      UNIFORM
                    Still lookin'.  School kids on a
                    field trip this mornin' found this.

      He hands a clear Evidence BAG to Sarah -- inside a shimmery
      pink SWEATER.  Torn, blood-smeared.

                                      HOLDER
                    This park's Tweaker Central at nights.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        15.

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                    Bottom of the barrel types bring
                    their tricks here.  Could be some
                    basehead got her ass beat.

      He turns to Sarah but she's focused intently on the sweater.

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                          (to Uniform)
                    You check ERs for any incoming last
                    night?

      The Uniform, sullen, glances at Sarah, back to Holder.

                                      UNIFORM
                    Nah.

                                      HOLDER
                    Why not?

                                      SARAH
                    Cuz that's your job.

      She hands the bagged sweater back to the Uniform.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Owner's not an addict.  Least not
                    the type hangs around here.
                          (off Holder's look)
                    Wool sweater.  Looks recently cleaned.

                                      HOLDER
                    She brought it to the coin wash, so
                    what.

                                      SARAH
                    You dry clean wool.  Know any tweakers
                    drop their wardrobe off at the
                    cleaners?
                          (to uniform)
                    What else you got?

                                      UNIFORM
                    Not much.  Safeway card.

      He holds out a baggie: inside, a club CARD.  Scrawled on the
      back a name: "STANLEY LARSEN".

                                      UNIFORM (CONT'D)
                    Belongs to a 'Stanley Larsen.'

                                      HOLDER
                    Guy loses his wallet while he's
                    gettin' his knob polished?                                                                                        16.

                                      SARAH
                          (to Uniform)
                    Keep lookin'.  And call in Sex Crimes. 
                    This is theirs for now.

      She heads to the car.  Holder, surprised, follows--

                                      HOLDER
                    Yo.  We got here first.

                                      SARAH
                    Yeah and we don't got a body.

                                      HOLDER
                    Not yet.

      Sarah, impatient, checks her watch.

                                      SARAH
                    You wanna follow it up, go for it.

                                      HOLDER
                    You're my ride, Linden.

                                      SARAH
                    Look, I'll drop you off at the
                    station, I gotta finish packing up--

                                      HOLDER
                    Thought you were done.
                          (off her look)
                    Hey, your flight's not til nine,
                    right?  I won't let you miss it. 
                    Promise.

      Holder flicks the bagged Safeway card, walks ahead.  Sarah
      clocks something on the back of his neck, peeking above his
      collar: a TATTOO.  The top of an ornate CRUCIFIX.  Sarah,
      curious, follows.  PRELAP SFX: BEEPING--


      BEEPING comes from a small moving TRUCK -- "LARSEN MOVERS"
      printed on its side -- as it backs up to a small grocery
      store.  Muslim SIGNAGE above the locked freight entrance.

                                    STAN
                    Keep comin', comin'... stop.

      Directing is STANLEY LARSEN -- 39, bullish, ex-biker, former
      boozer/brawler turned small business owner and family man. 
      "Larsen Movers" on the back of his red UNIFORM.

                                      BELKO
                    What's that... stank?                                                                                        17.

      From the driver's side emerges BELKO ROYCE -- mid 30s, wimpy,
      mullet-wearer, wanna-be bad boy with a voice that squeaks
      when he's pissed.  Stan's employee and best buddy.

                                    STAN
                    Gonna lose my customer, you keep
                    that up.
                          (to Old Man)
                    Stanley Larsen.  Mr. Abdullah here?

      Stan nods to an approaching OLD MAN -- Somali, shrunken,
      late 60s, in full jellabiya.  A puffy down jacket over his
      traditional Muslim attire.

                                    OLD MAN
                          (heavy accent)
                    Abdullah no here, say you take...

      He indicates a small pile of PALLETS near the freight door. 
      Stan pulls out paperwork, checks--

                                    STAN
                    That it?  He said there were twenty
                    of 'em.

      The Old Man stares, smiling, not understanding.  Belko rolls
      his eyes, impatient.

                                      BELKO
                          (loud)
                    He said there were twenty!  Twenty!

                                    STAN
                    He ain't deaf, Jesus, Belko.

      Stan makes a "bigger" gesture with his hands, points to the
      pallets.  The Old Man nods eagerly, unlocks the freight door.

                                    OLD MAN
                    Ya, ya, here, okay...

      Belko glances around, locking eyes with a clutch of hijab-
      clad SOMALI WOMEN breezing by on the cracked, lumpy sidewalk.

                                      BELKO
                    Place gives me the creeps.

                                    STAN
                    Nie panikuj.

                                      BELKO
                    Nie panikuj, my ass, Stan, Al Qaida
                    there be hatin' on us.

      Meaning a group of SOMALI KIDS - 8, wearing koofiyads and
      jeans -- kicking a soccer ball in an garbage-filled, weedy
      lot.  Staring at them openly.                                                                                        18.

                                    STAN
                    Belko.  He can hear you.

                                      BELKO
                    Osama here don't give a shit.
                          (to Old Man)
                    Do you, Osama?

      The Old Man, unsure, smiles.  Missing most of his teeth.

                                      BELKO (CONT'D)
                    What'd I tell you?

      Stan grins, shakes his head.  The Old Man rolls up the freight
      door.  Inside, racks of frozen GOAT CARCASSES hang in rows.  
      Halal meat store.  Belko pulls his jacket over his nose--

                                      BELKO (CONT'D)
                    Oh, damn.

                                    OLD MAN
                    More.  See?

      Indicating another pile of pallets inside.  Stan nods--

                                    STAN
                    Got it.  Thanks for your help.

                                      BELKO
                    Yeah, Happy Kwanzaa, my brother.

                                    OLD MAN
                    My name Faisal.  Not Osama.

      Belko stares, busted.  Stan smirks.

                                    STAN
                    Tell Mr. Abdullah I'll drop off his
                    paperwork tomorrow.

      The Old Man nods, shoots Belko a haughty look, exits. 

      A mortified Belko quickly tosses pallets into the back of
      the truck.  Stan joins, suppressing laughter.  Can't.  Bends
      over, busting out.

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                    Osama poned you...My brother...

      Sending himself into another gale.  Belko grins reluctantly.

                                      BELKO
                    Hey, Stan.  Eat me.

      Both of them laughing together now.  Old friends.  Stan's
      cell phone RINGS.                                                                                        19.

                                    STAN
                          (into phone)
                    Larsen Movers.

                                      MITCH (O.S.)
                          (from phone)
                    Stan, you need to get home right now--


      Ballard waterfront: squat factories, fishing boats moored on
      Shishole Bay, small, rusty bridges connecting the former
      working class neighborhood to tonier parts of the city.

      Below a sign reading "LARSEN MOVERS" a small, modest working
      garage, the Larsen' apartment above it.  In the apartment's
      front door are lovebirds Mitch and Stan -- post love-making,
      tousled hair.  Mitch adjusts Stan's collar--

                                      MITCH
                    Think they know we just did it?

      Meaning their EMPLOYEES -- including Belko -- in the open
      garage, labelling boxes, pretending not to be looking.

                                    STAN
                    I'll be sure to give 'em a blow by
                    blow.

                                      MITCH
                    You're sick.

                                    STAN
                    Ain't the only one.

                                      MITCH
                    Shut up, you.

      They grin at one another.

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    Hey.  Gotta ask you something.

                                    STAN
                    What.

      She fiddles with his collar, suddenly nervously--

                                      MITCH
                    Don't get mad, promise?                                                                                        21.

                                    STAN
                    Mitch.  What is it.

                                      MITCH
                    Rosie said she'd apply to schools...
                    But she wants to go outa state.

      Stan's face darkens.  Mitch, going for the save--

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    That's good news, right?  Her finally
                    wanting to go to college?

                                    STAN
                    If that's what she wants.

                                      MITCH
                          (annoyed)
                    Course it is.
                          (off his look)
                    Stan, I'm not gettin' into this again--

                                    STAN
                    Outa state?  Isn't she kinda young?

                                      MITCH
                    Almost eighteen, gotta let her go
                    sometime, Papa.

      A flicker of sadness in Stan's face.

                                    STAN
                    I'll think about it.

                                      MITCH
                    Can we afford it?

                                    STAN
                    If that's what Rosie wants, we'll
                    make it happen.

                                      MITCH
                    Thanks, babe.  I mean it.

                                      BELKO (O.S.)
                    Got a move down in Burien, Stan. 
                    Gonna be late...

      Belko climbs into the moving truck, grinning.  Loving this
      family like his own.

                                    STAN
                    Gotta go.

      He smacks her ass playfully.  Mitch pinches his ass back. 
      As he climbs into the truck--                                                                                        22.

                                      MITCH
                    Stan?

      They lock eyes, smile.  Doesn't get better than this. 

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    Nothing.  Get outa here.

      Saying it all without words.  He drives off, passing a
      BILLBOARD on the street.  On it a handsome, Kennedyesque-
      looking man.  Underneath the words: "RICHMOND FOR MAYOR"--


      Seat of political power in Seattle.  Skyscrapers, old stone
      buildings, manicured parks.


      Under a darkening sky, Mitch throws out wet rags, a seriously
      fucked up MOP.  Sarah, chomping GUM, and Holder approach:

                                      HOLDER
                    Lookin' for a Stanley Larsen?

      Mitch makes them right off, her face hardening, busying
      herself with the trash--

                                      MITCH
                    He's not here.

                                      HOLDER
                    You his wife?

                                      MITCH
                    Yeah.  What's this about?

      Sarah, quietly observant, takes in the empty garage, modest
      apartment building while Holder talks:

                                      HOLDER
                    Know where we can find him?

                                      MITCH
                    Stan's on a job, I don't know where
                    at.

                                      HOLDER
                    What about last night?  Where was
                    he?

      Mitch puts the lid on the trash can.  Crosses her arms.

                                      MITCH
                    Why're you asking about Stan?                                                                                        29.

                                      SARAH
                    Your husband usually go out at nights,
                    Mrs. Larsen?  Not tell you where?

      Mitch barks annoyed laughter, turns to her--

                                      MITCH
                    Course not.  Stan's always home with
                    me and the kids nights, that's
                      ridiculous--

                                      SARAH
                    Last night, too?

                                      MITCH
                    We were on a camping trip, okay? 
                    Got in late, so yeah.

                                      HOLDER
                    You always get like this when the
                    police come around?  Askin' about
                    your husband?

                                      MITCH
                    No, I don't.  And they don't.  I got
                    things to do, okay?

      Rain begins to fall.  Sarah hands her a CARD.

                                      SARAH
                    Have him call.
                          (to Holder)
                    Let's go.

                                      HOLDER
                    Sure he didn't duck out last night? 
                    Maybe after you got in bed?

                                      MITCH
                    Christ, what's your problem?  Yeah,
                    I'm sure.

                                      HOLDER
                    How?

                                      MITCH
                    How do you think?

      Oh.

                                      SARAH
                    Let's go.

      They head towards the car, Sarah amused.  Holder not.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Making friends and influencing people.                                                                                        30.

                                      HOLDER
                          (annoyed)
                    So we just wait for this guy to call?

                                      SARAH
                    In situations like this I always ask
                    myself... What Would Jesus Do?

      Holder turns to look at her.  Gets it.  Deadpan--

                                      HOLDER
                    He'd say: let her cover for her ho-
                    chasin' husband, ain't my STD.

                                      SARAH
                    Hard-core guy, that JC.

                                      HOLDER
                    The Lord works in mysterious ways.

                                      SARAH
                    Never figured you for a God freak,
                    Holder.

                                      HOLDER
                    Who says I am?

      Sarah grins, warming to him, glancing back at Mitch.  Her
      smile fades.

      Mitch hurriedly wheels several BIKES into the garage, out of
      the rain.  Two clearly belonging to little boys.  The third
        adult-sized.  A girl's.  Painted SHIMMERY PINK.  Same color
      as the sweater in the park.

                                      SARAH
                    Excuse me.  Mrs. Larsen? 
                          (beat)
                    Do you have a daughter?

                                      MITCH
                    Yeah.  Why?

                                      SARAH
                    She go on that camping trip, too?

                                      MITCH
                    Rosie spent the weekend here.  At a
                    friend's house.

                                      SARAH
                    When'd you last talk to her?

                                      MITCH
                    Friday.  Before we left town.  Why?

      Mitch worried now by Sarah's intense stare.                                                                                        31.

                                      SARAH
                    Call her.

      PRELAP SFX: ringing school BELL--


      CAMERA GLIDES under an old, steel bridge, its girders coming
      slowly into frame, black slashes across the rainy sky...


      A crap park on the waterfront, catty corner to the Market. 
      HOMELESS dot the benches, teen RUNAWAYS congregate against a
      stone wall.  Among them, on his skateboard, is KRIS EMERSON --
      17, white, skinny jeans, multiple pierces, gages in his ears.

                                      STERLING
                    Kris?  Hey...

      Sterling, out of breath, stands at a safe distance with her
      BIKE.  Fish out of water.  Kris skates up to her leisurely:

                                    KRIS
                    'Sup, Ster-ling.

      Rolling her name on his tongue like toffee.  She blushes.                                                                                        43.

                                      STERLING
                    I need to talk to Jasper.  But, like,
                    he's not at school or at his house...

                                    KRIS
                    And you care... why.

                                      STERLING
                    Cuz the cops are looking for Rosie. 
                    Did they hook up this weekend?

                                    KRIS
                    And I should tell you... why.

                                      STERLING
                    Kris, come on.  She could be in
                    serious trouble, I mean it.  Jasper
                    too.

                                    KRIS
                    Gimme a smoke first.

      Sterling hands him her PACK -- notes his filthy fingernails,
      the post-tweak tremor in his hands as he lights up.

                                    KRIS (CONT'D)
                    He's on the island, weekend house. 
                      Parents're in Abu Dabi or some
                    diseased hole like that.

                                      STERLING
                    So is she with him?

                                    KRIS
                    Scored some blue mickeys, figured
                    he'd be lookin' to bone.

                                      STERLING
                    God...  Gimme his new cell I don't
                    have it.  Kris, come on.  Fine.

      She angrily tosses her pack at him.  He expertly spirits it
      away, produces a filthy pen:

                                    KRIS
                    Come 'ere.

      Kris takes hold of her wrist, slowly writes the number on
      the soft, white flesh of her inner forearm.  Practically
      fucking her with the Bic, with his eyes.  Sterling, freaked,
      steps away.  Rolls down her sleeve.

                                      STERLING
                    Okay... See you.  Thanks.  Bye.

      He wags his tongue at her.  Steel PIERCE in the middle of it
      flashing like a knife.  Bye bye.  Sterling flees on her bike.                                                                                        44.

      SFX: groovy RING of a cell phone--


      AERIAL on the mist-covered islands dotting the Sound.  So
      many places to lose a child.  TILT UP to reveal the Ballard
      skyline...


      TRACKING SHOT of tidy one story homes, white picket fences,
        breathtaking Puget Sound.  Middle America with million dollar
      waterfront views.  Over this--

                                    STAN (O.S.)
                    ... Used to drive around here, me
                    and Mitch, when Rosie was little.

      PULL BACK to reveal Stan in the driver's seat.  Belko riding
      shotgun, chomping a SUB.  Both of them enchanted by the view.

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                    Pretended like we lived here, you
                    know.  Like... we were comin' home.                                                                                        47.

      He stops the truck in front of a modest HOUSE -- peeling
      paint, overgrown yard, a FOR SALE SIGN on the front lawn.

                                      BELKO
                    Be nice to own that one, huh?

      Stan exits the truck, uproots the FOR SALE sign.  Chucks it.

                                    STAN
                    Already do.

                                      BELKO
                    Shut up.  Stan?  You serious?

      Stan smiles.  Quiet pride.  Belko exits the van.  Can't
      believe this shit.

                                      BELKO (CONT'D)
                    You can't afford this.  What about
                    all the work's gotta be done?

                                    STAN
                    That's why I got you.

                                      BELKO
                          (quietly)
                    You need some help with cash, all
                    you gotta do is say so.

      Stan turns, stares.  Scary fucker when he gets quiet-mad.

                                    STAN
                    I'm done with that.  Been done.

                                      BELKO
                    Just sayin'.

      Belko pouting.  Something else going on here.

                                    STAN
                    You know, it's got a basement.  Fix
                    it up, make it nice, place to stay
                    you ever need one.  Just sayin'.

      Belko nods, moved as hell.  Stan's a good friend.

                                      BELKO
                    What's Mitch think about this?
                          (realizing)
                    You're in for a world of hurt, my
                    brother.

                                    STAN
                          (beat)
                    Rosie never had a backyard when she
                    was a kid.  Doesn't seem right.  A
                    kid not ever having that.                                                                                        48.

      Belko glances at him but Stan won't meet his eye.  A quiet
      moment.  Then Belko's phone RINGS.  He checks it--

                                      BELKO
                    Why's Mitch callin' me...?


      Modest houseboats line the dock.  Beneath the arching steel
      bridge, Sarah walks hurriedly with her son, JACK -- 13 going
      on 30, spiky gelled do, handsome, sullen.  She's angry,
      distracted.  Half of her still in the case--

                                      SARAH
                    ... Smoking cigarettes?  At school? 
                    Really, Jack?

                                    JACK
                    It's not like I was doing crack,
                    Mom, God.

      She looks at him, baffled.  Who the fuck is this kid?

                                      SARAH
                    You're going to have to stay with
                    Regi til I'm done with work.

                                    JACK
                    Fine.

                                      SARAH
                    And a promise you won't ever do that
                    again would be nice.

                                    JACK
                          (by rote)
                    Okay, I won't do it again.

      At the far end of the dock, a woman on a small houseboat,
      REGI - 60s, short hair, flannel shirt -- waves.  Sarah smiles
      tightly, waves back.  Smoothing things over--

                                      SARAH
                    So... how was school otherwise?                                                                                        50.

                                    JACK
                    Fine.

                                      SARAH
                    You give our address to your friends?

                                    JACK
                    We're on Facebook, Mom.  Kids don't
                    write letters that's retarded.

                                      SARAH
                    Well it'd be great for them to visit
                    us sometime.

                                    JACK
                    Like that's ever gonna happen.

                                      SARAH
                    They'll love California, there's so
                    much to do for kids your age.  It'll
                    be great.

      Jack looks miserable.  Sarah looks away.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    You'll make a lot of new friends. 
                    Rick's putting together a little
                    party to get all the kids in the
                      neighborhood together--

                                    JACK
                          (softly)
                    He's not my father.

      Sarah looks at him, stunned.  Her cell phone RINGS.  A beat,
      then she fumbles for her it as Jack wanders to the edge of
      the dock.  Used to coming in second.  As she talks, he works
      a big wad of spit from his mouth, dangles it over the water--

                                      SARAH
                          (into phone)
                    What is it, Holder.

                                      HOLDER (O.S.)
                          (from phone)
                    Got the K-9s, we're starting a sweep
                    of the field...

                                      SARAH
                    Yeah, okay.  I'll be there.

      She hangs up.  Looks at her son, at a loss here.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    He's trying his best, Jack.

      Jack watches the spit hit the water.  Doesn't turn around.                                                                                        51.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Jack?

                                    JACK
                    What?

      He turns to look at her.  Oblivious.  Sarah sighs.

                                      SARAH
                    I gotta go.

      She indicates the houseboat, Regi waiting, waving.  Without
      a goodbye, Jack shuffles off.  She watches his small, narrow
      back weighed down by his huge backpack.

      Sarah waits until he reaches the end of the dock.  Regi takes
      him in her arms easily.  Some women do motherhood naturally. 
      Not Sarah.  Torn, distracted, she leaves...


      HANDLERS unleash their K-9s.  Walk a single uniform search
      line through the brown, wavy grass.  In search of a body...


      Deep in the woods now, Handlers, K-9s, CSU mill.  Holder in
      the thick of it.  Sarah approaches--

                                      SARAH
                    Whaddya got?

                    K-9s picked up her scent.  Started
                    at the fire road where we found the
                    sweater.  Looks like she ran a zig
                    zag through the field.  Ended here.

      He indicates the ground they're standing on.

                                      SARAH
                    You sweep for possible burial sites?

                          (nods)
                    Nothin'.

      In the distance, the sound of a train HORN.  Sarah look up --
      intense, strange eyes -- taking in the field, the woods.

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                    Maybe she's not here?

                                      SARAH
                    Where's the map?

      He hands her a MAP.  She studies it intently.                                                                                        52.

                          (into walkie)
                    Yeah, Linden.

                                    CSU #1 (O.S.)
                          (from walkie)
                    Got a possible burial site.  Northeast
                    corner of the woods.

      Sarah glances back at a chastened Holder.  Moves on--


      Narrow alley behind a weathered clapboard house.  Trash cans
      neatly lined up against a wire fence.  A CAT mewling,
      circling.  Sterling locks her bike against the fence.  Bends
      down to pat it--

                                      STERLING
                    Hey there, Jinxy, you hungry again?

      Footsteps behind her.  She turns, startled.  It's Stan.

                                    STAN
                    Where is she, Sterling?

      She stands, quivering, unable to meet his eye.

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                    Where's Rosie!

      She looks at him, trembly smile.  Tears in her eyes.  Stan's
      face softens.  Despite his veneer, a gentle man.

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                    Just tell me.  Please.                                                                                        55.

                                      STERLING
                    She's... with Jasper.

      Stan's eyes go cold--


      Sunlight fades, almost night.  Deep in the woods, CSU and
      UNIS circle a dig site.  Holder and Sarah look on.                                                                                        56.

      RING RING, Sarah's phone.  She answers--

                                      SARAH
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah.

                                      OAKES (O.S.)
                    Found the girl.


      Sarah on the phone with Oakes:

                                      SARAH
                    Mom talk directly to Rosie?

                                      OAKES
                    No, to her friend.  I'm not
                      authorizing anymore OT, I don't care
                    what Lewis wants.  We're way over
                    budget on this thing--

                                      SARAH
                    And you believe Mom's story?

                                      OAKES
                    Only story is some kid got laid. 
                    Come on in, Sarah.  It's over.  Don't
                    you have a plane to catch?

      He hangs up.  Sarah's not buying it.  Then--

                                      HOLDER (O.S.)
                    Linden.

      He's bent over the dig site.  At its bottom, a BLANKET covers
      something lumpy.  Holder pulls back the blanket, revealing--

      A grimy plastic DOLL.  One eye caked with mud.  The other a
      glaring, periwinkle blue.  Holder turns to Sarah:

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                          (baby voice)
                    Mama?

      The Uniforms guffaw.  Sarah moves off, irritated.                                                                                        57.

                                      SARAH
                    Wrap it up.  We're done here.


      PD UNITS pack up gear and K-9s.  Sarah stands there, map in
      hand, dog with a bone herself.  BEEP BEEP--

                                      HOLDER
                          (yelling)
                    Let's go, Linden!

      Holder slouches against the car, waiting.  Sarah ignores
      him, pops another NICORETTE.  Her phone RINGS, she answers--

                                    RICK (O.S.)
                    I'm thinking barbecue...


      Rick drives, sun-kissed Sonoma hills in the b.g.

                                    RICK (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    ... Steaks, burgers, hot dogs for
                    the kids, vegan whatever for the
                    weirdos who do that...


      Sarah nods, half listening, scanning the map:

                                      SARAH
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah, sounds good, Rick.

                                    RICK (O.S.)
                    Then again if Emilio's caters, we
                    don't have to deal with cleanup...

      He blathers on in her ear.  Holder approaches--                                                                                        60.

                                      HOLDER
                    What's the hold up?

                                      SARAH
                    Gimme a minute.

                                      HOLDER
                    You said that twenty minutes ago.

      Frustrated, Sarah drops the map.  Rick still yakking in her
      ear.  In the distance, the train HORN again.  She takes one
      last look around.  Zeroing in on--

      Three 12-year-old GIRLS pushing bikes on the fire road. 
      Fishing POLES slung over their shoulders.

                                      SARAH
                    Where does the fire road lead to?

                                      HOLDER
                    The Sound, why?

      He notes her intensity.  Knows what it means by now.  Shit--

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                    We're not dragging the Puget Sound
                    cuz the girl's not missing anymore. 
                    Remember?

                                      SARAH
                    How far away is it?

                                      HOLDER
                    The other side of the park, Linden,
                    no way she made it there on foot. 
                    Plus she was running in the other
                      direction--

                                      SARAH
                    So where are those girls going?

                                      HOLDER
                    Who cares?

                                    RICK (O.S.)
                          (from phone)
                    Sarah?  What did you say?


      Rick, on his phone, confused:

                                    RICK (CONT'D)
                    ... Are you there?  Sarah?                                                                                        61.


      Sarah stares intently at the girls.  At what lays beyond
      these woods.  Her strange eyes unblinking.

                                    RICK (O.S.)
                    Hello--?

      Sarah hangs up.  Thinking--

                                      SARAH
                    If they're not going to the water... 
                    why do they have fishing poles?

      Beat.  Holder, reluctantly intrigued now, takes the map. 
      Studies it.  Looks up slowly:

                                      HOLDER
                    There's a lake on the other side of
                    the woods.

      Off Sarah's gaze--


      As the last rays of light fade, Sarah and Holder wait on the
      banks, watching the DIVERS surface, give a thumbs up.

      A crane CLANKS into motion -- pulling something from the
      depths.  A CAR.  Watering pouring from it...


      Klieg lights shine down on the fire road where the black Car
      now rests, center stage, dripping water.  Sarah and Holder
      circle, checking inside.  Nothing.  Sarah nods to a UNI:

                                      SARAH
                    Open the trunk.                                                                                        63.


      Stan stops his truck on the fire road, blocked by Crime Scene
      TAPE and UNIS.  He emerges, stone faced, cell phone in hand:

                                      MITCH (O.S.)
                          (from phone)
                    What's going on?  Stan?

      The Unis try to wave him off but Stan doesn't see them.  His
      gaze locked onto the crowd gathered around the black car...


      Sarah and Holder watch as the Uni opens the trunk.  And then
      they stare, expressionless, at what's inside --

      CU of a Girl's ANKLES, grossly swollen, bindings cutting
      deeply, cruelly into the bluish, mottled skin...

      CU of bloated WRISTS and HANDS -- painted fingernails chipped
      and broken, palms deeply cut -- bound just as tightly...

      CU of a beautiful BUTTERFLY PENDANT on a necklace wrapped
      tightly around a the soft flesh of a girl's bare neck--

      BACK TO SCENE

      Sarah and Holder look on grimly, knowing.  Rosie.  From behind--

                                    STAN (O.S.)
                    Lemme go!  Lemme go!

      At the perimeter, Stan fights off the Unis, enraged--

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                    Rosie!  Rosie!

      Sarah, always hating this part, takes a breath.  Heads off. 
      Holder, new to this brand of horror, watches her grimly...


      Sarah ducks under the tape, approaches Stan, her face neutral. 
      He sees her, stops fighting.  The need and pain in his eyes
      so naked, raw --

                                      SARAH
                    You can't be here, Mr. Larsen.

                                    STAN
                    Is it my daughter?  Is it my daughter!

      Her face giving it away.  Her quiet words--

                                      SARAH
                    I'm sorry.  You can't be here.                                                                                        64.

      In a stupor he steps forward, shaking his head slowly.  No. 
      Another step, no.  Heaves himself suddenly at Sarah--

                                    STAN
                    No!

      Animal agony, out of control, out of his mind--


      Drained, Sarah walks back to the black car.  There, CSU TECHS
      are already quietly at work.  Holder meets her--

                                      HOLDER
                    Ran the plates.
                          (beat)
                    Car belongs to the Richmond campaign.

                                      SARAH
                          (stunned)
                    Richmond?  City Councilman Richmond?

      Holder nods.  Holy shit--


      POP!  A camera flash CLOSE ON Rosie's bound feet.  POP! 
      Another flash CLOSE ON her cruelly bound hands.  POP!  A
      third on the butterfly necklace.

      Sarah stands above the body, looking down.  Haunted by what
      she sees.  POP!  And now we see it, too--

      Rosie - bloated, fish belly pale, one leg bent at an unnatural
      angle.  Her once pretty face mottled black and blue.  Her
      dead eyes like punched out, blackened windows.

      Someone's little girl beaten and broken and torn apart, then
      tossed away like a piece of garbage...                                                                                        65.


      Stan fights the cops, crazed with grief, horror, as they try
      to put him in a patrol car.  No luck.  They wrestle him to
      the ground, camera CRANES high above this broken man...


      Techs and Unis continue to work, flashbulbs POPPING.  Sarah
      stands apart, alone, staring down into the trunk.

      Camera PUSHES IN slowly on Sarah.  Her unblinking, strange
      eyes fixed on the trunk's sad contents...

      REVERSE PUSH IN on Rosie's body.  Her dead eyes staring back
      into camera, into Sarah...

      CONT. PUSH IN to a CU of Sarah, her carefully controlled
      face shifting slightly.  Knowing what she has to do now...

      CONT. PUSH IN to an ECU of one of Rosie's staring eyes. 
      Sarah reflected in it.  And the silent plea...

      Find him.

                                        END EPISODE
