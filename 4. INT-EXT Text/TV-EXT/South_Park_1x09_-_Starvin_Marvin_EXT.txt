               Terrance and Phillip, wearing pilgrim hats, stand in front 
               of a boat.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Hey Terrance, looks like this might 
                         be a good place to start a new colony.

                                     TERRANCE
                         It sure does Phillip. Nobody will 
                         oppress our religion here!

               Terrance farts loudly on Phillip.

                                     PHILLIP
                         OH!! YOU STAINED MY PILGRIM HAT, 
                         BUTT PIPE!

               A young couple is walking along the pond holding hands and 
               looking lovingly at one another.

                                     WOMAN
                         Look how the leaves fall so delicately 
                         on the surface of the pond. It's so 
                         beautiful...

                                     MAN
                         Not as beautiful as you.

                                     WOMAN
                         Oh!

               They kiss. Over the woman's shoulder the man sees a group of 
               turkeys. They have doubled in number.

                                     MAN
                         Oh, Darling, look. Thanksgiving 
                         turkeys.

                                     WOMAN
                         Ooh, They're so beautiful...

                                     MAN
                         Not as beautiful as you.

               The turkeys come close and surround the couple. The man turns 
               to the woman.

                                     WOMAN
                         Look at the way they foam at the 
                         mouth. Like beautiful suds of beer.

                                     MAN
                         Not as beautiful as --

               Just then the group of turkeys attacks and tears the couples 
               clothes to shreds.

               Establishing. Lightning strikes.


               The sun sets, and night falls on South Park,


               There is a large crowd gathered in the middle of South Park. 
               We see the canned food grab capsule. There is a podium and 
               microphone set up.

               The mayor and her assistant stand next to the can grab 
               capsule.

                                     MAYOR
                         So, how does this thing work?

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Well, Mayor. Its based on the cash 
                         grab. But instead of money, the cans 
                         of food are blown around inside the 
                         capsule. The pov catches as many as 
                         he can to feed his family.

                                     MAYOR
                         Pov?

                                     ASSISTANT
                         POVerty stricken citizen.

                                     MAYOR
                         Oh, brilliant!

               Suddenly the flock of wild turkeys (it is bigger now) attacks 
               the Thanksgiving decorations. A flurry of feathers, 
               decorations and gobbling.

                                     MAYOR
                         Aaaah! What the HELL is THIS?

                                     ASSISTANT
                         I don't know, Mayor.
                              (looking at a program)
                         I don't think it's listed on the 
                         program.

               Mephesto appears again.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         They're increasing in number!! Mayor, 
                         these are the vicious Turkeys I warned 
                         you about!!

               Chef appears Stan, Kyle and Kenny are following him.

                                     CHEF
                         It's true, Mayor! those turkeys just 
                         ripped apart my cafeteria!! WHOA!!

               Just then the turkeys run past Chef, gobbling.

                                     CHEF
                         YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS YOU 
                         BASTARDS!!!

                                     KYLE
                         Wow! Those are some PISSED OFF 
                         turkeys!!

                                     MAYOR
                         Okay, people, don't panic. Bring out 
                         the defense squad!

               Jimbo and Ned appear with shotguns. They immediately start 
               firing their guns, and the turkeys start running away.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         We need more than that! They'll only 
                         come back in increased numbers!!

                         OVER HERE!!!!


               In the barren, desolate African landscape, Cartman is walking 
               among the starving masses, pissed off.

                                     CARTMAN
                         This is SERIOUS BullSHIT!! There has 
                         to be a Happy Burger around here 
                         somewhere...

               Cartman walks by a starving family.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Innocent and Sweet)
                         Excuse me, I am a lost little boy. 
                         Could you help me?

               The family just lies there, dying.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well SCREW YOU TOO!!

               Cartman storms off.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Waving his arms around)

                         ever heard of insect repellent?!


               The whole town has gathered for the Thanksgiving day canned 
               food grab.

               Kenny is onstage with the mayor.

                                     MAYOR
                         Alright everyone, it's time to give 
                         out canned food to the poor.

               The townspeople cheer. Stan and Kyle look at each other with 
               concern.

                                     STAN
                         Hey, where's Cartman?

                                     KYLE
                         I don't know. Do you know where he 
                         is Marvin?

                                     MAYOR
                         Looks like we have the turkey problem 
                         under control. It's time to embrace 
                         the spirit of giving with the canned 
                         food grab!

                                     MAYOR
                              (To Kenny)
                         Come on. Hurry up!

               Kenny walks into the capsule. The air-tight door closes behind 
               him.

               Now we see Kenny's family for the first time. His mother, 
               father, brother and sister are all average looking, but 
               dressed poorly.

                                     KENNY'S MOTHER
                         Grab a lot, son!!

                                     MAYOR
                         HAPPY HAPPY THANKSGIVING. LET'RRRRR 
                         RIP!!!

               A whirring sound is heard and the cans begin to fly.

                                     MAYOR
                         C'MON, GRAB THOSE CANS LITTLE BOY!!

               Kenny gets hit with cans and tossed around roughly.

                                     STAN AND KYLE
                         Come on, Kenny!!

                                     KENNY'S DAD
                         C'mon son!!

               It gets more violent as the power of the air actually picks 
               Kenny up off the ground and makes him fly around like the 
               cans.

               For a moment we can't even tell what's happening, just a 
               blur of whirling cans and Kenny. Finally the mayor shuts the 
               machine off.

               Kenny stumbles out, dizzy and holding just one little can.

                                     MAYOR
                         Now let's see all the goodies you're 
                         gonna take home to your family!!

               The mayor grabs the can from Kenny, who passes out.

                                     MAYOR
                         It looks like he got a... a can of 
                         string beans!

               The audience cheers.

               But they stop when they hear a familiar, ominous sound...

               Gobble, gobble, gobble!!

                                     CHEF
                         What the...?

                                     STAN
                         DUDE! THE MUTANT TURKEYS ARE BACK!!!

               Everybody panics! They turn to see the turkeys, now a huge 
               mass, heading towards them!

               The turkeys attack! There are hundreds of them and they 
               immediately tear into everything. It is total pandemonium. 
               Barbrady tries to keep control.

                                     BARBRADY
                         Okay, people, move along! Nothing to 
                         see here, lookie loos!

               But the chaos continues. There is screaming and blood and 
               feathers. Finally, the turkeys run off.

               Chef climbs onto the stage.

               Mephesto runs up to the Mayor.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         I tried to tell you but you didn't 
                         listen!!

                                     CHEF
                              (Into the microphone)
                         Gather 'round everybody, and listen 
                         good! Go to your homes and arm your...

                         What the hell are you supposed to be 
                         anyway?

                                     MEPHESTO
                         That's not important right now.

                                     CHEF
                         No! What the hell is this little 
                         thing supposed to be? It doesn't 
                         look like anything.

                                     MAYOR
                         Chef! The turkeys!

                                     CHEF
                         Oh alright. Listen up everybody, and 
                         listen good. Go to your homes and 
                         arm yourselves with whatever you 
                         can. We'll meet back here in fifteen 
                         minutes. Hurry!

               The people scatter.

                                     CHEF
                         We're not gonna let our thanksgiving 
                         be ruined by a bunch of turkeys!


               Cartman now looks beaten, tired and hungry as he roams the 
               African landscape.

                                     CARTMAN
                         You guys... Seriously... I'm HUNGRY!!! 
                         I HAVE TO EAT!!!

               Just then Cartman notices a group of Americans. Several red 
               cross members with a box.

                         Oh sweet, the Red Cross. I'll have 
                         fried chicken and a side of mashed 
                         potatoes please.

                                     RED CROSS MEMBER
                         Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We 
                         ran out of funding.

                                     CARTMAN
                         What!!!!

                                     RED CROSS MEMBER
                         We just couldn't get enough sponsors 
                         back home. So now we've got to pack 
                         it up.

                                     CARTMAN
                         But I'm not a starvin' ethernopian. 
                         I have to get back home too.

                                     RED CROSS MEMBER
                         Sorry dude, we just don't have any 
                         funds. Here have a Taiko sports watch.

                                     CARTMAN
                         WEAKKKKK!!!!!!


               The residents of South Park are armed and ready for battle 
               atop a hill. It's like a scene out of braveheart.

               They are armed with guns, knifes, baseball bats and pieces 
               of wood.

                                     MAYOR
                         People... We all have to do our part 
                         against the evil turkeys...

                                     TOWNSPERSON
                         There's too many of them.

               The townspeople moan.

                                     MAYOR
                         Come on, where is that Thanksgiving 
                         spirit?

                                     TOWNSPERSON
                         We can't stop them.

               They moan again. But then:

               Chef rides in on a horse. His face is painted half blue, 
               half white.

                                     CHEF
                         Today you fight for your city! You 
                         fight for your honor! These turkeys 
                         will continue to push until they 
                         have taken everything from us!!

               The townspeople listen on, enthralled.

                                     CHEF
                         These fudged up turkeys from the 
                         crustaceous era can take our lives, 
                         but they can never take our FREEDOM!!!

               The townspeople all cheer.


               On the other side, the turkeys are rallying too.

               They are gathered in a mass, ready for battle. One turkey 
               stands in front of them, it's face is painted half blue, 
               half white, it appears to be giving a speech.

                                     TURKEY LEADER
                         Gobble, gobble gobble gobble gobble 
                         gobble gobble gobble! Gobble gobble!!

               The turkeys watch on, enthralled.

                                     TURKEY LEADER
                         Gobble gobble! Gobble, Gobble gobble 
                         gobble gobble gobble gobble!!! gobble 
                         gobble GOBBLE!!!

               The turkeys all cheer/gobble.

               They turn and face the townspeople.

               The townspeople face the turkeys.

               KYLE MOONS THE TURKEYS

                                     KYLE
                         Here you go turkeys!

               The turkey leader gives a war gobble! The turkeys all follow.

               THE TWO MASSES CHARGE EACH OTHER!!!!

                                     MAYOR
                              (To Assistant)
                         Does my hair look okay?


                                     CARTMAN
                         Can't... go on... need appetizer...
                              (Shouting to the sky)
                         I'M SORRY GOD, I'M SORRY I MOCKED 
                         POOR PEOPLE!! I'M SORRY I WASN'T 
                         MORE SENSITIVE!! PLEASE!!! PLEASE 
                         GOD!!!!

               Cartman falls down.

               He just lays there looking dead for several seconds.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Quietly)
                         My God has forsaken me...

                                   COMMERCIAL BREAK #3

               Finally, he picks his head up and sees a small building.

               Cartman gets up and walks to the building.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Whoa, I wonder what's in here?

               Cartman opens the door --


               Cartman bursts out the door and shouts to all the Ethiopians.

                                     CARTMAN
                         YOU GUYS!! SALLY STRUTHERS IS HOLDING 
                         FOOD FROM US!!!

               The Ethiopians all stand up.


               The two masses collide. An incredible battle ensues.

               Blood and gobbling everywhere. Graphic shots of turkeys 
               getting pummelled with baseball bats and South Parkers being 
               smothered.

               The children, armed, are standing close to Chef.

                                     CHEF
                         Stay close, children!

               Chef guards the children, killing a few attacking turkeys.

               The children cheer Chef.

               But just then, several turkeys jump on Kenny! Kenny flails 
               around, but the turkeys hold tight.

               More Turkeys jump on Kenny as he jumps around and tries to 
               get away. But the turkeys overpower him.

               Kenny falls to the ground where turkeys pluck out his 
               eyeballs.

                                     STAN
                         Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!!

                                     KYLE
                         You bastards!!!

                                     JIMBO
                         The last three are getting away. 
                         Shoot 'em Ned!

               Ned fires on the remaining turkeys.

                                     TOWNSPERSON
                         We did it!


               Finally, the battle slows as the last of the turkeys is 
               destroyed.

               The townspeople all cheer.

                                     MEPHESTO
                              (standing over the 
                              turkey carcasses)
                         My God, what have we done?

                                     CHEF
                         We've saved Thanksgiving!

                                     MEPHESTO
                         But all those poor turkeys... They're 
                         all dead!

                                     CHEF
                         Every turkey dies. Not every turkey 
                         truly lives.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         As horrible as they were, they felt 
                         like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't 
                         be toying with God's creations... 
                         Perhaps I should just --

                                     CHEF
                              (We've all heard this 
                              before)
                         Yeah, yeah, yeah......

               The two agents step through the carnage and approach the 
               kids and Chef. Marvin is not visible.

                                     AGENT 1
                         Excuse me, sir. We're looking for a 
                         little starving Ethiopian boy who 
                         was accidentally delivered to South 
                         Park instead of Taiko sports watch.

                                     AGENT 2
                         Have you seen anyone fitting this 
                         description?

                                     BARBRADY
                         Oh, that could be a hundred kids in 
                         this town, Mister.

               But suddenly, Marvin walks up and tugs on the agents pantleg.

                                     AGENT 1
                         There you are!

                                     AGENT 2
                         Are you ready to go home now?

               Marvin looks at Mr. Garrison, Chef, Barbrady... And then 
               nods his head quickly.

               The agents take Marvin's hand and lead him past the Turkey 
               carnage.

                                     STAN
                         Wow... It sucks he has to leave.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, I like him a lot more than 
                         Cartman.

                                     STAN
                         You know, I think I've learned 
                         something today. It's really easy 
                         not to think of images on TV as real 
                         people, but they are. That's why 
                         it's easy to ignore those commercials. 
                         But people on TV are just as real as 
                         you or I.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah...
                              (Thinking)
                         And that means that McGyver is a 
                         real person too.


               Three red cross members are escorting Cartman through the 
               village. Cartman is eating a pot-pie as he walks.

                                     RED CROSS MEMBER
                         We're terribly sorry about the mix-
                         up little boy. We'll get you back 
                         home immediately.

                                     CARTMAN
                         That's right you will, God dammit!

               They walk past the food line.

               Cartman breaks into the line.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Move it, Povs! I'm an AMERICAN!!


               A large plane lands in the midst of the desolate village.

               Little Marvin steps off and is immediately surrounded by his 
               friends and family.

                                     ETHIOPIAN
                         Ababa!! Dlook dlook baba raka!

                                     STARVIN' MARVIN
                         Baba dlook ri nama bam!

               As more people gather around, Starvin Marvin gestures to the 
               plane. Everyone looks on as hundreds of dead Turkeys are 
               dropped from cargo hold.

               Everyone rejoices and cheers.

               Several Ethiopians start grabbing the turkeys as others hoist 
               Marvin up on their shoulders and victoriously march him into 
               the town --

               -- passing, on the way, Sally Struthers is bound and gagged 
               and tied to a pole.


               It is indeed a POV house; small and cheap.
