The car is approaching a bridge.
The car lunges to the side of the road and weaves a bit in
the gravel. Up ahead a bridge approaches.
The rest is a blur...
... Trevor loses control of the steering wheel... Kirsty
SCREAMS... Their car skids from one side of the bridge to the
other-careening toward the guardrail- SMASH!
The car is plummeting toward the river below. Trevor and
Kirsty brace themselves. The car hits the surface...
Trevor paddles hard to the shore. Exhausted, he crawls onto
the shore underneath the bridge they just jumped.
Trevor stands trying to process what just happened in the
last fifteen seconds. He screams out for his wife, and to
what has just happened.

TREVOR
Kristy!
Kristy!
Trevor drops to his knee's in distress.
TREVOR (cont'd)
Oh my God, Kristy! Please Kristy.
(frantically) I'm so sorry, Kristy.
He hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of the
bashed-up guardrail from the bridge has just snapped off and
is sailing right down toward him-
TREVOR BLACKS OUT JUST AS THE THING HITS HIM
WHITE LIGHT FLOODS HIS VISION...
Dressed in a button down shirt and tie, Trevor walks up to
the pale utilitarian box-like structure.
The car fishtails. Trevor loses control and the car skids
from one side of the bridge to the other- careening toward
the guardrail- SMASH!
The car is plummeting toward the river below... The car hits
the surface...
He breaks the surface and crawls onto the shore...
He looks out at the car to where she should be trapped
inside...
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
Trevors eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening,
The car is sinking fast...
He looks at the car and calls out, but there is no Kristy
insight.
The car disappears under the surface...
Trevor hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of
the bashed-up guardrail is sailing right down toward him-
TREVOR BLACKS OUT JUST AS THE THING HITS HIM
The bus pulls up to the curb. Trevor climbs out and starts
walking down the empty street. As soon as the bus pulls away,
the only sound heard is Trevor's footsteps.
POV BEHIND TREVOR: We see Trevor's back from a slight
distance. Someone is following him.
Sensing this, Trevor looks behind him. Nothing but an empty
sidewalk. Trevor hurries his pace, almost there at his
apartment building. He glances behind him again. Nope, nobody
there... then suddenly-
-A DARK FIGURE passes under a streetlight on the opposite
side of the street. Trevor turns a corner no picking up the
pace a little. The DARK FIGURE follows, it picks up it's pace
as well.
Trevors walks an d approaches a small alley way. Should he
take this home?
A enraged Pitbull nearly rips his nose off as it Barks and
lunges to the end of a heavy chain leash. Trevor (and us)
about piss our pant's. The dog continues barking, Trevor
regains his composure. Suddenly the dogs attention moves
toward the direction of the DARK FIGURE. Amazingly, it stops
barking and actually cowers back into the shadows.
Spooked, Trevor rushes up to:
He hurries up to his apartment building and lets himself in.
Trevor gets out of the cab, which drives off leaving him on
the bridge looking down at the water below.
53.
Police tape FLAPS between the trees. Other than that there is
no sign of an investigation. Trevor walks out of the woods on
the shore, through the police tape and to the water's edge.
He begins to walk the shore looking out at the still water.
He scans the area where the water meets the land, trying to
remember.
Something on the surface few feet away catches his eye. It's
a rock sticking up. No it's something else. Trevor walks
right up to the water and puts his feet on a couple of large
rocks breaking the surface. He bends down and looks at...
THE CORNER OF A BLACK CUBE. He quickly reaches down, tries to
pick it up. It seems to be stuck just below the surface.
Trevor pulls harder and finally it gives. Trevor slowly lifts
the black cube out of the water and GASPS when he sees-
-A WHITE WATERLOGGED HAND CLUTCHING IT FROM BELOW!
Trevor GASPS and lets go. And just as the cube (along with
its owner) SPLASH under the surface-
-ANOTHER WHITE HAND breaks the surface grabbing Trevor's
wrist!
As Trevor Struggles he looks up to see the dark figure
standing above him holding a rock over his head. Just as he
swings down towards Trevors head-
smash cut to:
Trevor and Allison sit in a couple of chairs looking out at
the other rooftops around them.
TREVOR
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be
here.
ALLISON
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This
is where the emphysema patients come to
sneak cigarettes.
She points to the ground at myriad butts scattered at their
feet. Trevor smiles and looks at his hands.
ALLISON (CONT'D)
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
TREVOR
No. She just would have loved it up
here... Allison when I was under... did I
ever talk?
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
ALLISON
Sure plenty of times.
TREVOR
Was there anything I said that made you
stop and wonder, you know, "where did
that come from?"
ALLISON
Sure plenty of times.
TREVOR
Well?
ALLISON
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep
state they are obviously dreaming. So
practically everything say is going to
sound strange.
TREVOR
Did I ever talk about the accident?
ALLISON
No.
TREVOR
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
ALLISON
No. But at one point you did repeat
something though. A phrase. You must have
been having this recurring dream, you
just kept saying this one thing over and
over
TREVOR
What was it?
ALLISON
You said, "Jealousy arouses a husbands
fury, and he will show no mercy when he
takes revenge." (Proverbs 6:34) Does that
mean anything to you Trevor?
TREVOR
It means I have alot more questions.
Trevor stares off into the distance.
ALLISON
Times up for today. I've got to get back.
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED: (2)
Allison SMILES and pats Trevor's knee. He melts and puts his
hand on hers. She slowly takes it away and fixes her hair.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Sorry.
ALLISON
If it makes you feel better that took
every ounce of self control I had.
Trevor, I never date patients.
TREVOR
I understand... I won't-
ALLISON
No you don't understand. That's why I've
been fighting to get you better. So you
wouldn't be a patient anymore.
TREVOR
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would
have switched doctors!
ALLISON
Just get better okay?
She caresses his face then looks at her watch.
ALLISON (CONT'D)
I have to get back to work. And so do
you.
-Trevor's holding the phone up to his ear agitated beyond
belief. He'd pace if he could. Instead he just fumes.
TREVOR
(into phone)
Yes I'm trying to reach one of your
interns... Allison Dormere...? She works
in the emergency room there... What do
you mean...? I just saw her today... Yes
I'm sure she works there I've been in and
out of that place five times in the last
month...! Well good day to you too
asshole!
-CLOSE UP on Trevor's hand searching through the D's in the
white pages. He slams the book shut in frustration.
-He's on the phone again.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
No such listing...? Could you at least
tell me IF she has an unlisted number...?
What do you mean there are no Dormeres at
all there have to be...! WELL LOOK AGAIN!
(a beat, more timidly)
H-hello?
Trevor SLAMS the phone down and touches his head again. He
looks at his hand. The blood is gone. But the headache is
back. Its crippling at this point. He's at his wits end. He
reaches into his pocket and finds Pages card. Maybe as a last
resort?
THE PHONE RINGS. IT RINGS AGAIN. Trevor presses his palm
against his eye. Trevor picks up the phone.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Hello?
WIMPERING VOICE
(from phone)
Goodbye...
TREVOR
Kirsty?
WIMPERING VOICE
You miserable sonofabitch!
DIAL TONE.
66.
Trevor is out of breath as he walks up to the last resort.
The entrance to Sage's building. The front door is locked. He
presses a three digit code on the alarm box. RING. RING. The
phone picks up. He's deperate.
SAGE'S VOICE
Hello?
TREVOR
Sage it's me Trevor. You've got to help
me.
Dressed in janitorial garb, Trevor bursts open the stairwell
door and comes out on the roof.
An OLD MAN in a johnnie is sitting in one of the chairs not
too far away. An oxygen tube trails from his nose to an
oxygen tank at his feet.
OLD MAN
(wheezing)
Okay ya caught me.
He brings a cigarette to his lips and takes a long drag.
OLD MAN (CONT'D)
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff
left.
TREVOR
I don't work here.
OLD MAN
Music to my ears.
The old man lights a fresh cigarette with the one he's just
finished.
Trevor turns to go back and THERE'S ALLISON standing in the
doorway.
ALLISON
Trevor. I heard you were looking for me.
Is everything all right?
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:
TREVOR
Allison! Am I glad to see you!
(changing his tone) No... everything's
not right. Not at all.
ALLISON
Come here.
Allison holds him. The old smoker turns and watches with
curiosity.
TREVOR
Allison I think I did some very, very bad
things. I mean very bad.
ALLISON
Trevor things like this happen to people
who experience temporary memory loss.
Everybody does things they regret. You
just couldn't remember doing these things
and now you are so it's a shock to the
system. I'm telling you. You will never
get better if you keep blaming yourself
for your wife's death.
TREVOR
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car
accident...
The old man calls out to Trevor wheezily.
OLD MAN
Hey buddy!
TREVOR
(ignoring him)
... but I'm starting to think I was... I
was going to...
OLD MAN
Hey buddy!
Trevor turns to the old man.
TREVOR
What do you want?!
OLD MAN
(wheezing)
Who the hell are you talking to?
Trevor turns and Allison is gone. Vanished into thin air.
74.
Trevor steps out of the bus and faces the ROMAN CATHOLIC
CATHEDRAL. He ascends the steps.
Trevor's about to climb down the fire escape when he is
bathed in the flashlight's beam from inside. Trevor looks
down and sees a garbage dumpster full of trash bags below. He
jumps.
Trevor sails down three stories and lands in the dumpster. He
climbs out and runs to the street as fast as he can. He races
down the sidewalk trying to get his bearings at the same
time.
Hearing footsteps from behind Trevor turns to see:
The Stranger in the Window not half a block behind Trevor,
keeping Trevor's pace. Then... Trevor stops. And turns.
The Stranger stops as well. This has never happened before.
Trevor shouts down the empty street.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
WHO ARE YOU!
His voice echoes off the darkened buildings.
The Stranger stands there. Trevor begins walking toward him,
blood in his eyes. The Stranger backs away.
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:
Trevor bolts into a run and the Stranger takes off running
the other way.
The stranger darts into an alley.
Kirsty sits inside the car looking up at the window, eyes
narrowing.
PINHEAD (O.S.)
Jealousy arouses a spouse's fury.
And no mercy will be shown when that
revenge is given.
LOW ANGLE UP AT: Kirsty, Trevor's lovely wife, raising a rock
above her.
KIRSTY
(to camera)
Goodbye you miserable sonofabitch!
And SLAMMING a rock down on us.
bacK TO:
The car goes off the bridge landing in the water. Kirsty's
head breaks the surface. She watches the car sink into the
river.
baCK TO:
The birds are chirping. The sun is shining. Kirsty Gooding
walks out the door and takes a breath of fresh air. She skips
down the steps of the police station toward the street. She
stops in the middle of the sidewalk looking both ways.
A SHADOW COMES up behind her. It's the STRANGER Trevor had
seen out his window. He grabs her shoulder startling Kirsty.
She turns to see LARRY ELLIS, shit-eating grin on his face.
He's holding an eight month old BABY. The one he was drawing.
LARRY
Looking for someone, Kirsty?
KIRSTY
(taking the baby)
You bet I was.
Kirsty plants a multitude of smothering kisses on the
laughing child as A NANNY comes up behind Larry pushing a
stroller. Kirsty gently places the baby in it.
KIRSTY (CONT'D)
(to Nanny)
Okay we're on our way. Remember her-
NANNY
Lactose intolerance. I've stocked the
fridge with Lactaid.
KIRSTY
See you in a couple of weeks. You've got
my cell number right?
The Nanny pushes the stroller away, nodding, waving good-bye.
Larry smiles as he watches the baby go.
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
LARRY
Daisy is getting so big.
(beat)
I still can't believe HE was her father.
Kirsty smiles to herself.
KIRSTY
Counselor can we not mention HIM anymore.
Can we just start spending HIS money
instead.
They walk slowly toward the curb.
LARRY
I've always wanted to go to Madagascar.
KIRSTY
You mean the place with bats?
LARRY
They're called flying lemurs.
KIRSTY
Yeah that sounds like a real blast...
They put their arms around each other.
KIRSTY (cont'd)
I've been thinking about it. This has to
have been the best eight months of my
life.
Larry sees a cab and rushes out to hail it.
LARRY (CONT'D)
TAXI!
Something out the corner of her eye scares Kirsty. She turns
to see Lange standing there.
LANGE
You forgot something.
Lange holds up the cube she tossed out. Kirsty's expression
falls. But... how...?
KIRSTY
Oh. Thank you.
Kirsty takes the cube.
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED: (2)
LANGE (CONT'D)
No Mrs. Gooding.
Lange turns and Kirsty's shock there's Givens' face... on the
back of Lange's head!
GIVENS
Thank YOU.
Givens smiles at her then walks away. She slowly walks toward
the cab where Larry has opened the door for her.
LARRY
After you my dear.
As the cab drives off into traffic we see LIGHT FLICKER from
within it. The cab passes a cathedral. Its BELL BEGINS TO
TOLL.
