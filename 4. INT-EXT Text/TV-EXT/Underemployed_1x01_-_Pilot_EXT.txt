MILES
Who wants to lick my balls?


It's GRADUATION. STUDENTS and FAMILIES are all gathered and 
SOFIA, in her CAP AND GOWN, is giving an OPTIMISTIC speech.

SOFIA
No. Far from it. Today is just the 
beginning of a new chapter of hope; 
not just in our lives, but in the 
lives of people everywhere.

They keep walking. But the LITTLE BOY turns back and sneers:

ENZO
So what s the deal? Do you work on 
your novel at night, or what?

SOFIA
I try. But I usually sit at the 
computer for five minutes, come up 
with nothing -- and then play Word 
Warp on my iPhone all night.

ENZO
Word Warp?

SOFIA
Sometimes I play Angry Birds to mix 
it up. What do you do?

ENZO
I clerk at a firm, go to law school 
at night -- and play Word Warp.

DAPHNE
Well, I can t work for nothing. My 
Dad died five years ago. The money 
he left me got me through college:

cover rent. I need a new vaporizer.

Todd slowly smiles at Daphne, CHARMED and SEXY-CHARMING -- 
and very gradually Daphne notices the mood has changed.

(CONT D) DAPHNE
What the fuck is that happening?

TODD
Nothing. Nothing. You just remind 
me a lot of me when I was your age.

DAPHNE

Jared points to himself with TWO THUMBS and tilts his head.

JARED

LOU
It looks like one future. 

JARED
Is this about driving the van?

LOU
It s not about driving the van -- 
although I d love to drive the van. 
I just have to do better, ya know? 

JARED
If you could do better, Lou, why 
aren t you doing better already?

LOU
I don t know. Because I haven t had 
to? I graduated from Northwestern 
with a degree in environmental 
studies. I shouldn t be begging for 
signatures in shopping malls!
