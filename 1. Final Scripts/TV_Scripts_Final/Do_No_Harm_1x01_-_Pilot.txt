TEASER

FADE IN:

INT. BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER (BMC) - SURGICAL SUITE - DAY  

Chaos.  NURSES and RESIDENTS scramble to prep the OR.  But we 
are CLOSE ON an INSTRUMENT TABLE.  SCALPELS are laid out.  
BLADES arranged.  A SAW.  RETRACTORS.  Instruments of relief.  
Or torture.  Depending on the hand that wields them.   

NURSE 1

The CAMERA LANDS on the back of a DOCTOR.  Scrubbing in for 
surgery.  We catch his REFLECTION as he looks in the mirror.  
Meet DR. JEFFREY KOHL (40s).  He s leading man handsome with 
charm to spare.  Soulful eyes that you could get lost in.  
But there's something else behind those baby blues.  
Something dark and mysterious.  A secret he s keeping.  From 
everyone.  But you.  In VOICE OVER we hear:

KOHL (V.O.)
Before I pick up a blade.  Before I 
make an incision.  I have to look 
in the mirror.  To make sure it's 
me who's looking back.

Kohl turns to face us.  He walks into the OR where the storm 
of VOICES and BODIES and MACHINES hit him.  

KOHL (V.O.) (CONT D)
I have to be vigilant.  Take 
precautions.  To protect my 
patients I have fail-safes in 
place.  

A LARGE GLUCOMETER is wheeled in front of Kohl.  He resets 
the machine.

KOHL (V.O.) (CONT D)
Every doctor with diabetes is 
required to check their blood sugar  
before surgery. 

Kohl puts his finger in the Glucometer.  

KOHL (V.O.) (CONT D)

A nurse GOWNS Kohl.

KOHL  (V.O.) (CONT D)
If I fail the test I can't perform 
your surgery.  Which is a good 
thing.  Because it wouldn't be me

A GREEN LIGHT appears on the Glucometer.  Kohl is cleared as 
the PATIENT, DONALD WHITE (30s, unconscious) is quickly 
wheeled in.

ND RESIDENT
Unrestrained passenger in an MVA.  
Cerebral hemorrhage, ICP 40 mm Hg,

Jordan folds back the flap of skin and muscle, exposing the 
skull.

Kohl drills small burr holes into the skull.  

Kohl saws through the skull, connecting the burr holes.

Jordan lifts out the circular bone flap.  Beneath is a mess 
of blood, dark purple and coagulated.  The BLOOD IS 
EVERYWHERE.  It pours out like a faucet.

KOHL (CONT D)
Suction.4.


The nurses can t get rid of the blood.  It just keeps coming.

KOHL (CONT D)
Everybody jump in.  I need a lot 
more suction.

JORDAN
What do you think?  If we call it 
now I can make happy hour.

But Kohl is focused as he fights his way through the blood.

does not.

CUT TO:

INT. BMC - NEUROLOGY CORRIDOR - LATER

 WATCH: Set as a TIMER.  2:00 hours and CLOSE ON KOHL S
counting.  

KOHL (V.O.)
I have two hours left.

KOHL turns off the alarm as he walks down the hall.  We can 
see every DOCTOR wants to be him and every NURSE wants to be 
with him.  He graciously acknowledges them all.

KOHL (V.O.) (CONT D)
Two hours to feel like a normal 
human being.  The clock is ticking.5.


He comes face to face with DR. VANESSA HARRIS (50).  Chief of 
Surgery.  She is made of ice and Chanel.  Think Kristin Scott 
Thomas.

HARRIS
Just the man I was looking for.

They continue walking.

KOHL

HARRIS
Don t flatter yourself.  You are so

She gives him TWO TICKETS.

HARRIS

Heathcoat.  Your Acoustic Neuroma.  
Knock yourself out.

She walks off.  Kohl sees an ORDERLY mopping the floor.  

KOHL
Hey Calvin, you have plans tonight?

OLDER ORDERLY
Just watching the game on TV.

KOHL
 not.No you re

Kohl gives him the two tickets.  The Orderly is in shock.

OLDER ORDERLY
Box seats?  

Kohl smiles, and keeps walking.  

KOHL (V.O.)
I love the Red Sox.  Greatest team 
in the league.  But I can't enjoy 
the night games.  I'm just not 
myself after nine o'clock. 6.


INT. BMC - PATH AND LAB CORRIDOR - LATER

Kohl, now dressed to leave, walks down the hall with his 
secretary JOSH (20s, Aspergers).  

JOSH
--ECIC bypass at 10:30, lunch with 
Dr. Harris at noon, 1:30 phone 
interview with the New England 
Journal of Medicine...

Josh's voice DROPS OUT as...

KOHL (V.O.)
Most people have twenty-four hours 
in their day.  My condition leaves 
me with fourteen.  To make up for 
this I work seven days a week.  
Three hundred and sixty-five days a 
year.  I don't take vacations.  And 
I never get sick.  Well... besides 
 already a part the sickness that s

Kohl walks through a set of doors into--

INT. BMC - PATH LAB - CONTINUOUS

A large open room with CHEMISTS at individual workstations. 
One of them looks up at Kohl.  This is DR. AMIT SARIN (early 
30s).  

He motions for Kohl to follow him to a private lab.  

KOHL (V.O.)
There's no cure for what I have.  
No therapeutic approach.  No 
medically approved drug.  All I can 
do is suppress it.  Outthink it.  
Knock it unconscious.

 in private Amit produces a small vial of BLACK Once they re
LIQUID.  7.


AMIT
Here's your coma for the night.  

KOHL
Thank you Amit.  For your 
brilliance, and even more, for your 
discretion.

AMIT
No, thank you.m gonna make bank   I 
 gonna call it off this.  I m
Oblivion.  What do you think?  Does 
it sound too celebrity fragrance? 
Or is that a good thing?

KOHL
Keep working on it.

Kohl reaches for the vial but Amit pulls it away.

AMIT
Not so fast.  
(then)
I may be illegally supplying 
experimental drugs to an attending 
neurosurgeon, but I still have 
standards.

Amit shows Kohl data on his iPad.  

AMIT (CONT D)
These are the results from the 
metabolic panel we did last week.  
Sodium, potassium, chloride, all 
within range, but creatinine levels 
are high.  Very high.

KOHL
(concerned)
ll go over it  right.  We You re
tomorrow.  When I have time.  

Amit nods and reluctantly hands over the BLACK vial.  

KOHL (CONT D)
What about Blackout?

AMIT

But Kohl is already gone.8.


INT. BMC - PATH AND LAB CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Kohl slips the vial into his coat just as he hears:

LENA (O.S.)
Happy Birthday.

Kohl turns to find a beautiful brunette standing behind him.  
This is DR. LENA STECK (late 30s).  Attending Neurologist.  
Strong willed.  Confident.  

KOHL

about.

LENA

That s good to know.

KOHL
Who told you it was my birthday?

LENA

KOHL
You Googled me?

LENA

The chemistry between them is electric.  You get the feeling 
they want to rip each other's clothes off and lock themselves 
in a room for a week.  

KOHL
What else did Google say?

LENA
You know, award this, miraculous 
surgery that.  Eventually Google 
told me to just talk to you myself.

Kohl smiles.  A charged moment.  She touches his jacket, 
 hear her.  We only telling him she likes it.  But we don t
 V.O.hear Kohl s

KOHL (V.O.)
To protect those around me there 
are sacrifices I have to make.  
Relationships are off-limits.  The 
closer someone gets, the more in 
danger they become.9.


The SOUND COMES BACK IN.

Lena smiles and walks off.  Kohl watches her go.  Torn up 
inside.  Then Lena stops.  Turns around.

Not what Lena expected.10.


EXT. OLD SOUTH CHURCH - NIGHT

Jeffrey stands in front of the insanely beautiful OLD SOUTH 
CHURCH.  He makes his way towards the imposing Cathedral. 

INT. OLD SOUTH CHURCH - BASEMENT - LATER

A support group in progress.  A DOZEN PEOPLE.  Folding 
chairs.  Bad coffee.  You get the idea.  

Kohl waits in the hall.  Not going in.  He looks at EACH 
PERSON with a sympathetic eye.  

KOHL (V.O.)
They have trouble sustaining 
meaningful relationships.  Holding 
steady jobs.  I'm fortunate to 
practice medicine.  To do more good 
 than harm.  But the scale wasn t
always tipped in that direction.

The meeting breaks up and everyone starts to leave.  One man 
remains behind to clean up.  This is WILL HAYES (50s).  Big 
and imposing with a gentle demeanor.  He's both happy and 
annoyed to see Jeffrey lurking in the hall.  

WILL
You missed the support group.  
Again.

KOHL

Will indicates the FLYER ON THE WALL for the next meeting.

WILL

know about?

KOHL

WILL

Kohl can sense his acquiescence.  

KOHL
Five years without an incident.

So why are you here now?

KOHL

WILL
Okay, now I m actually paying

Will smiles.

WILL

throng of DINERS and SERVERS.  The CAMERA FINDS Lena talking 
and laughing with FRIENDS.  Lena looks up.

At the crowded bar Kohl and Lena are as close as possible 
without touching.  Laughing, having a great time.  

LENA
I always wanted to be an astronaut.  
Visit unknown worlds.  That s why I 
love neurology.  Our minds are like 
the universe.  Vast, mysterious, 
just waiting to be explored.

KOHL (V.O.)
He comes at 9 pm.  He leaves at 7

does not Spring forward.  He does 
not Fall back.  This is the way 
it's always been.  For as long as I

Kohl leans in to kiss her when--

Kohl FREEZES.  His pupils DILATE.  The lights become 
BRIGHTER.  The music becomes LOUDER.  He pulls away from 
Lena.

Kohl looks at his watch.  0:15 minutes and counting.  

LENA

Kohl LURCHES forward, spilling the drinks on the bar.  

LENA (CONT D)

Lena tries to help but Kohl instinctively pushes her away.

Kohl runs out.  Leaving Lena behind.  Stunned.   

INT. KOHL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kohl rushes into his apartment.  He looks down at his watch. 
0:02 minutes and counting.  

Kohl enters a combination on the computerized lock on the 
front door.  The door BOLTS shut. 

KOHL (V.O.)
In five years Ian Price has never 
gotten out of this apartment.  

Kohl takes out a syringe.  Fumbles to attach the vial of 
BLACK LIQUID.  His hands shaking. 

KOHL (V.O.) (CONT D)
For five years this drug has kept 
him captive.14.


Kohl drops the vial.  It rolls under the bed.

Kohl searches for the vial under the bed.  It's just out of

He's in the most insane hotel suite you've ever seen.  It 
just so happens to be completely TRASHED. 

Curtains hang by a thread.  Empty liquor bottles littered on 
the floor, mounds of cocaine and pills on a mirrored coffee 
table.  Half a dozen hot YOUNG WOMEN in various states of 
undress are passed out on the floor.  

Kohl, wild-eyed panic, looks in the mirror.  He s got a BLACK 
EYE.  He looks down at his hands.  His knuckles are bloody 
and bruised.  And then he sees his arms.  Two words are 
scrawled in black ink.  One on each arm.  

HAPPY.  BIRTHDAY.

TECH
So... um... you sure this is cool?

The Tech nods.  Kohl lies down on the bed of the MRI machine.  
The Tech flips the switch and Kohl glides in the MRI MACHINE.

TIGHT ON KOHL, inside the WHIRRING machine.  He tries to 
relax when--

FLASHES OF THE NIGHT BEFORE start appearing to him:

INT. BMC - PATH LAB - LATER

Amit and Kohl.  Amit reviews his test results.  Kohl paces.

KOHL
Maybe the vial you gave me was 
compromised, or the dosage needs to 
be adjusted.  Or the chemical 
compounds broke down over time--

To register how crippling this is.  

KOHL
Then make the drug stronger.

AMIT
A higher dose will kill you.  
Instantaneously.  Without question.

Kohl looks at the clock.  It s 5:55.  His entire existence is 
unraveling.

KOHL
So you re saying I have three hours 
left.  Until he destroys me.

AMIT

KOHL
Before I met you I took sleeping 
pills by the handful.  I tried

KOHL
As far away as you can get.

Kohl SLAMS the door and we--

CUT TO:

INT. BMC - DONALD WHITE'S ROOM - LATER

Donald White wakes up with a start.  Head still bandaged.  He 
orients himself.  Sees a pitcher of water under the mirror.  
He haltingly gets out of bed.  Uses the IV stand for support.

When he reaches the pitcher he looks up at his reflection in 
the mirror.  He instantly jumps back, terrified.  Donald 
looks into the mirror again.

DONALD'S POV: Ears, an eye, white bandages, another eye, a 
nose--all a mishmash.  In the wrong places.  Shifting.  An 
eyeball darts around in a panic.  It's a living Picasso.  It 
should be Donald's face.  But he's unrecognizable in this 
grotesque disorder.  Donald backs away from the mirror.  

CUT TO:

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT 

The CAB pulls off the highway into the parking lot of a 
secluded motel.  Kohl gets out.  Looks at his watch. 

CLOSE ON WATCH:  0:14 minutes and counting.  

He can feel IAN COMING.  The NEON LIGHTS become OVERWHELMING.  
The HIGHWAY SOUNDS DEAFENING. 22.


INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

A MOTEL MANAGER (60s, weathered) stands behind a counter.  
Kohl gives him his wallet, cell phone, pager, glasses.

KOHL
Fed Ex will pick this up in twenty 
 to overnight it minutes.  They re
to this address in Boston.  
(then)
And if you see me later... walk the 
other way.

Off the Hotel Manager... 

CUT TO:

INT. BMC - ICU CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Donald staggers down the hall.  He sees his REELECTION again 
in the glass windows.  It's HORRIFYING.  He increases his 
pace.  But everywhere he turns he sees the GROTESQUE IMAGES 
of himself.  In a MONITOR, a COMPUTER SCREEN, a WINDOW.

DONALD
Stop!  Go away!

A NURSE appears.  She tries to stop him, but he's flailing, 
screaming.

NURSE 3
Mr. White!

DONALD
Get it away!  Get it away from me!

She PULLS A CODE RED.  All hell breaks loose.  ORDERLIES come 
running, piling on to subdue him. Inject him with a SEDATIVE.

DONALD (CONT D)
That's not me!  It's not me! 

NURSE 3

Then in one deliberate move his hand WIPES THE MIRROR CLEAN.  
And we see IAN PRICE's reflection.  His features, though the 
same as Jeffrey's, look sinister.  Devious.  

Off the wicked smile on his face--

SMASH TO BLACK.

ACT TWO

He grabs his jacket, ready to leave, when a piece of paper

checks his own body--nothing.

Then he sees the floor.  A TRAIL OF BLOOD stretches across 
the room.  His worst fears becoming realized.

Kohl FOLLOWS THE BLOOD to...

Ian looks at her husband.  Walks over to him.  Grabs his 
hair, pulls his face off the floor.

IAN

remember, I make house calls.

Ian SLAMS him face into the floor as we--

The MYSTERIOUS MAN (JERE) from the train is sitting next to 
Ian.  Ian hired him to follow Kohl after all!  Ian looks at 
8x10 PHOTOS OF OLIVIA.  We can tell she means a lot to him. 

JERE

met her.  Nice neighborhood.  Near

INT. BMC - NEURO CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Ian walks down the hospital corridor.  His face intensely 
focused.  Menacing.  Everyone acknowledges him graciously.  
But unlike Kohl, Ian ignores them all.  He just walks with 
deathly purpose towards the surgical suites.  

INT. BMC - OUTSIDE SURGICAL SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

Dr. Jordan, Residents in tow, intercepts Ian.

to ruin your career.  I'm trying to 
ruin mine.

INT. BMC - SURGICAL SUITE - LATER

Ian scrubs in for surgery.  Looks at himself in the mirror.  
The same as Kohl did in the Teaser.  But this time a very 
different man looks back. 

INT. BMC - SURGICAL SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

Ian looks at the TEAM assembled before him.  All awaiting his 
cue.  He toys with a BLADE.  Smiles.

MUSIC: (I KEEP ON) RISING UP by Mike Doughty.

The surgery plays under the music.  Nurses, Techs, whirring 
machines.  

Donald is asleep, his body seated upright, with his skull 
open like a trap door.

ON A LARGE PLASMA SCREEN is an image of his BRAIN.

Kohl looks on from behind him, at a Nurse who gently wakes 
Donald.  His eyes flutter open.

KOHL
Hey Donald.  How are you feeling?

DONALD
...Pretty good.

A bizarre thing to hear from a person with his skull cracked 
open.

KOHL

MUSIC CONTINUES as Donald identifies parts of the body coming 
up on screen.  Each time a corresponding LIGHT APPEARS on the 
image of Donald s brain.  Making a constellation-like map of 
the areas Kohl needs to avoid.

Kohl takes a deep breath and buries his forceps into Donald s 
brain.

Lena turns to see Kohl.  She immediately starts walking in

eye contact with him.

forgiveness.

EXT. BOSTON HARBOR - ESTABLISHING - SUNRISE

The sun peeking up above the harbor.

EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - SUNRISE

The CAMERA TRACKS down a row of suburban houses.  Landing 
on...

 HOUSE - SUNRISEEXT. OLIVIA S

Where OLIVIA, in pajamas, walks out of her house.  She picks 
up the newspaper in the front yard.  Looks at the front page.  
Starts to walk back to the house when... she stops.  Has a 
creepy feeling.  Like she's being watched.  She looks around 
the neighborhood.  

Sees a few NEIGHBORS.  But that's all.  Nothing suspicious.  

What she doesn't see is IAN PRICE.  Hiding in plain sight.  
Watching her every move.  Hungry for her.

Just then a LITTLE BOY walks out of the house.  This is COLE, 
four-years-old.  He's in his pajamas and carries two little 
monkey lovies.  He looks like Jeffrey Kohl.  And Ian Price.  

Olivia picks him up in her arms and kisses him.  She gives 
the neighborhood one last look then walks back inside.  
 lovies falls to the Unbeknownst to them, one of Cole s
ground.

BACK ON IAN.  His curiosity more than piqued.  He walks out 
of the shadows and into Olivia's front yard.  He picks up the 
little monkey.

Just then the door opens.  And Cole walks out.  Cole stops 
when he sees Ian.  They both look at each other.  

IAN
Is this your monkey?

Cole nods.60.

pulls it away.
