A white car sits in the yard of the farmhouse. On the
door, a decal: "CAPETOWN SANITORIUM." Two men dressed
in the white uniforms of the sanitorium exit the farm-
house; one gently guiding a rather frail, troubled
woman toward the car; the other totes her suitcase.
The V.O. of a young man narrates:
YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
There comes a time in everyone's
life when they discover that the
only person you can truly depend
on is yourself. That the only
real power anyone has to get
anything done is the power of one.
With any luck you can make it
through a lot of years before you
ever have to face the reality of
that fact.
(beat)
It was a luxury I never had. I
discovered it the year my mother
had her nervous breakdown.
One attendant holds the rear door of the car open for
the woman. Before entering, she turns one last time
toward the farmhouse.

HER POV

A young BOY looking one part scared, one part sad, and
one part lost stares back at her, his hand held by a
large, amiable black woman with tears rolling down her
round cheeks.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
I was all of six.

BACK TO SCENE

The woman enters the car. The car drives off down the
road. The Boy watches it disappear behind a plume of
swirling dust.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
My father died before I was born,
and even though I was raised by
my Zulu nanny, with my mother,
depending on her health, in
nominal attendance, it was
decided, with her departure, that
I, too, would depart...
(beat)
... for boarding school.
The dust the Boy has been watching reverses itself.
An unseen vehicle comes up the road.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
But before I could be sent out
into the world one very serious
matter had to be dealt with.
(beat)
I was a chronic bedwetter. Since
my nanny was the one responsible
for my well-being, she did what
any responsible Zulu mother would
do. She called on the greatest
medicine man of her tribe --
Inkosi Inkosikazi.
Out of the dust a large black Buick ROADMASTER ROARS up
the road and into the yard, scattering chickens and
geese, stopping in front of the wide-eyed six-year-old
and his tremulous nanny. A huge Zulu jumps out of the
front passenger seat and opens the rear door. A moment
passes, and then two splayed, cracked feet descend from
the car and settle into the dust. INKOSI INKOSIKAZI,
100 years old, small, black, wizened, hair and beard
whiter than cotton, a leopard skin draped over his
shoulders, a beaded fly switch in one hand, a trussed
chicken in the other, exits the car.

A fire burns bright in the black African night. The Boy
sits holding the chicken, close by the fire, while Inkosi
Inkosikazi shuffles around him, drawing a circle in the
dust with a stick.

YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
Legend had it that Inkosi
Inkosikazi was the last son of
the great Zulu king, Dingaan,
who fought both the Boers and
the British to a standstill
nearly 100 years before, and the
night Inkosi Inkosikazi was
conceived stars fell from the
sky until the sun rose.
The circle
complete, the old man sits down opposite the
Boy. From
a leather pouch he produces several bones. He
throws the
bones on the ground and studies them for a
moment. He
begins to wave the fly switch back and forth
in front of
the Boy's eyes, chanting low, softly. The
Boy's eyes
grow heavy; his lids droop.

The Boy and the old man are standing above a great
waterfall. In the swirling pool far below are ten
stepping stones linking one bank to the other.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
The medicine man instructed me to
jump off the falls and climb along
the ten stepping stones, counting
as I went until I reached dry
land.
The Boy jumps, cascading down the
falls and into the pond
below.
He clambers up the first
rock. It is slippery.
He falls off and climbs back on,
buffeted by the spraying
water.
He makes his way stone by
stone toward the other
side.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
Even though it was only a dream,
I felt as if my struggle to reach
dry land was terrifyingly real.
The water was like ice, bone-
chilling, cold, and as I made my
way from one stone to the next I
could feel my strength desert me.
The progress from one step to the next gets progressively
harder as the Boy keeps slipping into the swirling water,
coughing and sputtering.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
I was three rocks in when I ran
out of gas. I couldn't pull myself
any further. No matter how hard I
5.
tried, the current tried harder.
I felt myself going under for the
last time.
The Boy's grip slips off the rock.
He starts to go
under.

The fire has gone out. The Boy is still sitting in the
circle, the chicken still in his lap. His eyes snap

sitting across from him with a big smile.

Inkosi Inkosikazi enters the Buick. The Boy and his
smiling nanny watch. They Boy still holds the chicken.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
Inkosi Inkosikazi said the spirit
of the great Zulu warriors lived
in me. He told me that whenever
trouble arose I should return to
the waterfall and keep stepping
across the rocks until the trouble
passed. He said three rocks were
enough to conquer my problem with
the night water; that I was very
brave. He said I was a man for
all Africa, bound to her by my
spirit, bound by my dreams.
(beat)
And he let me keep the chicken.
The Boy and his nanny watch the car go off in a cloud of
dust.

The Boy sits on a train looking out the window at the
veldt and the wildlife moving across in the distance.
A sack on his lap moves. The chicken's head pops out.
The Boy gives him some kernels of corn and scratches
behind his scraggly comb.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
Although I was bound by spirit
6.
and dream to Africa, I was bound
by heritage and language to the
birthplace of my grandparents --
England -- a country I had never
seen, but one that was to cause
me eminently more problems than
bedwetting ever did.

Morrie consults the book.
MORRIE
You win and your dream comes true.
You lose, we're back to bread

PK
My appointement before the Oxford
committee came through.
MORRIE
A snap.
PK
For a brain like you, maybe.
MORRIE
Come on, you'll read one of your
pieces, they'll be begging you to
attend.
PK
But will they pay for the
privilege?
MORRIE
Well let's bloody hope so. It'll
be a lonely time without you
there.
PK
Morrie Levy. Is that the voice
of sentimentality I hear coming
from you?
MORRIE
Sentimentality my ass.
Practicality. Where am I going
to find a sure thing like you to
make book on at bloody Oxford?
PK
Go on.
He shoves Morrie playfully out the door and follows.

Indeed, "Fortress Virgin." Surrounded by a high stone
wall, the school's gothic towers loom medieval in the
African moonlight. A security guard mans the front gate.
PK takes a route through shadows and shrubs, searching
for a way in. He finds one in a tree whose massive limbs
reach over the wall. In a flash PK is up the tree and

A brilliant African sun beats down on the veldt below.
On the rock, a seven-year-old PK sits looking somewhat
sadly over the landscape. A long shadow covers him.
The CLICK of a CAMERA is heard. PK turns, shielding his
eyes with his hand against the glare of the sun to a
tall, white-haired figure, shirtless, in hiking boots
and kneesocks, holding a box camera.
DOC (FIGURE)
Ja. Perfect.
You will excuse me,
please.
DOC, speaking in German-accented English, moves off from
the sun's glare down to PK's level. On his back is a
knapsack with a cactus sticking out of it.
DOC
This I do not normally without
permission do, ja? But to catch
the expression. After all, it is
the expression that is important.
Ja? Without the expression the
human being is just a lump of meat.
You have some problems, I think.
I am Professor Karl von Vollensteen.
Doc clicks his heels together and bows his head slightly.
PK
I'm P.K.
He holds out his hand.
Doc takes it.
DOC
Such a young person with such an
31.
old expression. I think we can
be friends. Ja?
Eighteen-year-old PK narrates.
PK (V.O.)
That was how I met Doc, as he
insisted I call him. A chance
meeting between a directionless
seven-year-old boy and an old
German professor out collecting
cacti on the African bush veldt.
(pause)
So began my education.
Doc and PK walk the veldt across craggy mountain trails,
down dry river beds, through the jungle, always collecting
cacti and aloe samples, Doc always talking, always
explaining.
PK (V.O.)
Doc believed the brain had two
functions and that the South
African public school system
unfortunately dealt with only one.
DOC
The brain, P.K., has two functions.
It is the best reference library
ever, which is a good thing to
have. Ja? But also from it comes
original thought. In school you
will get all filled up with the
facts. Here your brain will learn
where to look, how to look, how
to think. And then you will have
for yourself all the brains that
have ever been.
Doc and PK sit high up. PK watches the endless animal
migration below while Doc points things out across the
landscape.
PK (V.O.)
Doc knew everything. He had a love
of learning. But his real passion
was centered around two things --
music and cacti.

PK and Doc walk up a steep road toward Doc's house which
sits on top of the hill, both carrying cacti-filled

packs.
PK (V.O.)
Until he was fifty, Doc had a
successful career as a concert
pianist all over Europe. On his
fiftieth birthday he gave it all
up and moved to South Africa.
From that point on it was all
cactus.

Behind Doc's simple, whitewashed cottage is a magnif-
icent cactus and aloe garden filled with the samples Doc
has collected for years. PK and Doc plant another
specimen. Doc photographs it. PK records its genus
in a notebook.
PK (V.O.)
Every specimen Doc found would be
carefully photographed and
catalogued.
CUT TO:

SUNSET

Doc an PK walk through the cactus garden.
DOC
If God would choose a plant to
represent Him, I think He would
choose of all plants the cactus.
This one plant has all the
blessings He tried but failed to
give man. It is true. Look.
The cactus is humble but not
submissive. It grows where no
other plant will grow. The sun
bakes its back, the wind rips it
from cliffs, or drowns it in the
dry desert sand. Not a complaint.
In good times or bad it will
still flower. It protects itself
from danger.
Doc touches a cactus needle.
DOC
But it harms no other plant.
It
33.
has patience and solitude and
modesty. In Mexico there is a
cactus that blooms once in a
hundred years and then only at
night. That is saintliness of
the highest order I think. Ja?
From cactus comes medicine to
heal the wounds of men and little
buttons if you eat one you can
touch the face of God or stare
into the mouth of hell. It is
the plant of patience, solitude,
love, and madness. Modesty,
beauty. Toughness and gentleness.
Of all the plants I think it is
closest to God. Ja?
PK (V.O.)
Doc was a hard man to disagree
with. So when he decided I must
spend as much time with him to
remedy the flaw in my educational
environment I didn't argue.
CUT TO:

Doc and PK wander through the jungle looking for flora.
DOC
Everything fits, P.K. Nothing is
unexplained. Nature is one big
chain reaction. Everything
depends on everything else. From
the smallest to the biggest.
Always in life an idea starts
small like a tree.
Doc shows PK a small tree with an even smaller vine
attached to it.
DOC
This tree can grow so high it can
touch the face of the sky. But
this little vine can choke it and
keep it small. Most people are
like these vines. Afraid of new
ideas. Afraid to let things grow.
Doc rips the vine away from the tree.
DOC
Always listen to yourself.
Follow your own idea. If you are
wrong, so what? You learn
something. And with learning you
grow stronger. And if you are
right at the beginning? An even
bigger bonus.

Doc and PK move alongside the great herds.
PK (V.O.)
I roamed the kloofs and ridges,

today.

I also played a lot more 'God
Save the King' due to my new
musical celebrity.

TRACK THROUGH Barberton, a small town on the low veldt,
in all its colonial backwater splendor.
PK (V.O.)
Barberton was a very proper
English town with a proper square,
a wide main street, and the
colonials' overblown patriotism
for a homeland most people had
never seen, hanging in the air
like fine dust. Not quite seen,
but there nonetheless.

Doc and PK walk toward the cottage.
Doc reads PK's
report card.
DOC
Grammar: satisfactory. Science:
satisfactory. Mathetmatics:
satisfactory.
He looks down at PK.
DOC
P.K., if there is one thing I
know you to be that is a lot more
than just satisfactory. Ja?
PK
But I don't want to be known as
a brain.
DOC
Why not?
PK
Who do you think gets beaten up
on all the time in school?
DOC
My boy, to be smart is not a
sin. But to be smart and not use
it, that is sin number one. And
as for getting beat up on, use
your brain to figure out how not
to be.
He hands PK the report card, his displeasure obvious.
As they crest the hill the cottage comes INTO VIEW
along with a parked Army car and two armed soldiers
leaning against it. Seeing Doc and PK, the soldiers
smarten up, raising their rifles and advancing.
Doc's face grows pale, his lips tight.
PK pulls close to
him for support.
DOC
Again it begins. The stupidity.
Do not be frightened.
Doc puts na arm around PK's shoulder, drawing him close,
comforting him. One of the soldiers pulls a pair of
handcuffs out of his pocket as he advances.

A car pulls up. Doc, in shackles, is escorted from the

BRITISH OFFICER (V.O.)
Karl von Vollensteen, for the
failure to register as an alien
during times of war in accordance
with His Majesty's government
orders to do so, you are hereby
sentenced to be confined at
Barberton prison for the duration
of the war with Germany.
At the door a guard touches PK's
shoulder, holding him
back. The door opens. Doc goes

the door closes he looks back at
PK one last time. The
door slams shut. PK, with tears
streaming down his
cheeks, is left outside.

walking through the carnival, munching popcorn.
MARIA
You took a big chance talking to
my father the way you did.
PK
Not really. Going in I was behind
on points with him. I'm English.
I attend a politically suspect
school. I'm a boxer.
MARIA
He likes boxers.
PK
All men like boxers. But not for
their daughters. So I had to find
some way to make an impression.
They get on line for the Ferris wheel.
MARIA
You could have picked a more
agreeable topic.
PK
And made much less of an
impression. Talk to someone
about their passion. Even if they
disagree they'll remember you.
It was really the most logical
strategy if you think about it.
MARIA
Do you spend hours thinking
about how to deal with me, too?
PK
Days.
MARIA
Know what I think?

You're dangerous.
Their turn comes to mount the Ferris wheel.
They get
into the seat and strap in.
MARIA
When I was little we would go to
my grandfather's farm in the high
veldt for holiday.
The Ferris wheel starts to go up.
MARIA
My father would take
me
to the top

we'd play
this game, 'What Do
You
See' until
we ran out of things
to
see. Do
you ever play that?
PK
No.
MARIA
Want to try?
PK
Sure.
The Ferris wheel stops to let more people on.
Johannesburg

MARIA
I see a forest. It goes
on
forever. There are giant
trees
which keep getting bigger
and
bigger over thousands of
years.
Now you.
The wheel begins to move a little higher and then stops.
PK
I see little trees growing on the
forest floor, learning to grow
with the little bit of light the
big trees let in. Now you.
MARIA
I see the big trees getting bigger,
their leaves and branches making
one great green umbrella over all
of Africa.
The wheel stops again at its highest point.
PK

I see the sun growing weaker,
giving off less light. I see the
big trees dying because they
cannot live without a lot of
light. I see the little trees
take over the forest because they
learn to adapt.
MARIA
You tell a very good story.
Her eyes sparkle, making her irresistible. PK leans
forward. Maria turns her face towards him. Her lips
part slightly. They kiss tenderly.

No you're not.
PK
Yes I am.
He kisses her again. This time she responds, kissing him
back. The kisses become more passionate, touching, feel-

passes, its headlights arcing across the tree, startling
them out of their passion. They cling to the shadows

a little embarrassed by it.
PK
You know every time they do that I

GEEL PIET
To them you are. You are the one

but you don't

importer.
GEEL PIET
No matter that, Professor. We
always manage here. What pains me
most is I lose my boxer.
PK
I'll come back.
GEEL PIET
(adamant)
No, kleine baas. You leave this
damn place you don't come back
never.
DOC
Geel Piet, when a painter finishes
a work of art he doesn't lose it.
He sends it out in the world so
everyone can see the genius of his
creation. This is what you are
going to do. And to celebrate the
launch of such a work of art as
you have made our boxer here, I
have composed an entire concerto
-- 'The Concerto for the Southland'
-- which it is my intention to
play in concert for the prisoners
before I leave.
GEEL PIET
Not possible. The kommandant
never allow the people to have
such a thing.
DOC
He'll think it's a concert for him
and the brass. But we'll know,
ay? And the people will know.
PK
He'll never let black be with
white here, Doc.
DOC
If the black is part of the
68.
orchestra, like the piano, he
will.
GEEL PIET
But the people have no instruments
in this place, big baas.
DOC
They have their voices. Each
tribe a different voice, a
different language -- all singing
together. It is brilliant, no?
PK
Except the tribes don't trust each
other. They don't even talk to
each other.
DOC
(crestfallen)
Oh. This is correct.
This stupid
hatred.
GEEL PIET
They will do it for you, kleine
baas. You are Onoshobishobi
Ingelosi. You bring the tobacco.
You write the letters. You put
clothes on their children's bodies
and food in their bellies. All
you do is ask and they all sing
for you.
DOC
He's right. Wunderbar.
You are
the smartest of us all.
Geel Piet smiles as he lifts the watering pot to exit.
A
truncheon stops him. All turn to Sergeant Bormann.
BORMANN
A kaffir smarter than all of us?
You are a strange German,
Professor.

That little maniac with the
moustache in Berlin you admire.
He is the strange German. And
soon kaput, I hope.
BORMANN
If that's true you'll not be long
for this place, eh, Professor?

DOC
No, Sergeant.
God willing.
BORMANN
And you, too, little Rooinek.
But
you, kaffir, Hitler comes or
goes...
He takes Geel Piet's hand.
BORMANN
You are going to stay with me.
He forces Geel Piet's hand closer and closer to a cactus
with long thorns.
BORMANN
And I will find out all your
secrets once your friends are
gone. One slip...
He pushes Geel Piet's hands onto the cactus needle.
Geel
Piet does not cry out.
BORMANN
I have you.
He lets go of Geel Piet's hand.
Geel Piet removes it
from the cactus, bloodied.
BORMANN
Get out of here.
Geel Piet takes his watering can and goes.
BORMANN
You see, Professor, they are not

bloody murder.
Doc and PK glare at Bormann.
He smirks and walks away.

PK and Geel Piet appear before various tribal leaders,

PK (V.O.)
Having obtained the cooperation of
all the tribal groups, we set

The doors open to an entire soccer field jammed with
humanity. A boxing ring is raised in the center. The
only lights in the area directly over it. With the
twelve witnesses in the lead, the party makes its way
through a path in the crowd. An OLD WOMAN with a fly
switch, not unlike Inkosikazi's, speaks from the ring.
As PK passes the whispers start.
WHISPERS
Onoshobishobi.
80.
The Woman in the ring begins to chant.
The crowd picks
it up.
CROWD
Onoshobishopi Ingelosi.
Shobi shobi Ingelosi.
PK looks back at Maria who is a bit unnerved, as are
Morrie and Solly. He looks across at Mandoma whose face
is a mask looking straight ahead, betraying nothing. The
two men climb into the ring and stand in their corners.
The Old Woman shuffles over and peers into PK's face.
She mutters something inaudible, then turns to the crowd.
OLD WOMAN
Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.
The crowd picks up the chant. She waves and the crowd
goes silent. Somewhere in the darkness a single voice
begins to sing "Nkosi Sikelel I Afrika" -- the African
national anthem.
The crowd picks it up. PK looks down to the front row
where Nguni sits courteously attending to Maria in a seat
of honor among the twelve men in suits.
The African national anthem finishes. The BELL RINGS
three times. The Old Woman is led from the ring. An
Indian Referee in all white enters the ring and waves
the two fighters forward.
REFEREE
You are listening to me please.
When I am shouting break, you must
break at once. When a knockdown
is coming, it is for an eight
count. No heads, no elbows. You
fight clean or by golly I am
giving you penalty points. Good
luck, boys.
PK and Mandoma touch gloves and go to their respective
corners.
PK
What do you see?
Solly watches Mandoma dancing across the ring.
SOLLY
A very tough fight.
The BELL RINGS.
81.
SOLLY
Watch the left hook.
Mandoma comes charging across the ring and begins to fire
everything in his arsenal at PK, overwhelming him. PK
cannot get away from him and takes a series of devastat-
ing combinations which end in a left hook to PK's jaw.
PK drops like lead. The Referee starts counting. PK
shakes his head clear and rises at eight. The Referee
checks his gloves. There is a cut under his right eye.
REFEREE
Continue.
Again, Mandoma comes charging hard. PK defends himself
as best he can, trying to counter. But Mandoma's offense
won't allow it. He beats on PK until the round ends. PK
sits down in his corner. Morrie works on his eye.
PK
God, he hits like a truck.
SOLLY
He's going for the quick knockout.
He can't keep it up. Soon the
truck runs out of gas.
PK
If he catches me again like that
I'll run out of gas --
permanently.
The BELL SOUNDS. PK is hardly off his stool when Mandoma
is on him, pummeling him. PK backpedals, bobs and
weaves. Mandoma's punches come fast and furious, each
one looking to end the fight. Mandoma gets PK against
the ropes and bangs away. PK covers up. Mandoma
punishes his arms and kidneys. PK swings back and es-
capes. Mandoma pursues him. He catches PK with a body
chop and then a chopping left. PK goes down again. The
Referee starts to count. The crowd is completely silent.
The BELL RINGS. PK returns to his corner, shaking his
head, trying to clear it. He flops onto his stool.
SOLLY
He's had it. He's got no strength
in his punch.
PK
Could've fooled me.
SOLLY
I'm telling you.
PK

Tell him.

He pokes PK's belly.
SOLLY
You put your punches there, you
win. You don't, you lose.
The BELL RINGS. Mandoma comes charging out. PK goes on
defense. He hits Mandoma hard to the head. Mandoma
whips around and hits him hard. PK spins and hits the
canvas. His vision blurs, doubles. The SOUND of a
WATERFALL fills his head.

PK
In a fight behind on points.
REFEREE
Okay.
Continue.
Mandoma rushes in for the kill. PK feints and comes up
under one of Mandoma's punches, burying a body shot into
his gut. Mandoma grunts and backs up. PK pursues him.
Mandoma tries to recover. He throws another big punch.
PK ducks under it and puts two more hooks into Mandoma's
stomach. Mandoma starts to back up for the first time
in the fight. PK boxes, jabbing, feinting, pushing Man-
doma around the ring, taking control. Mandoma, heading
for exhaustion, throws another big punch in desperation.
PK hits him with three punches in return. Mandoma swings
again with a last desperate effort, and PK buries the
Solly Goldman thirteen into every part of his body. PK
steps back and with his last punch, puts Mandoma down.
The crowd goes silent. The Referee counts Mandoma out.
He raises PK's hand. Still, the crowd is silent.
MORRIE
We're in the shit now.
Nice
knowing you, Solly.
He and Solly look around at
the somber black faces flick-
ering in the shadows of the
ring light. PK looks
down at
Mandoma in silence. Mandoma
rises unsteadily. He
stands
in front of PK, staring into
his eyes, and then he raises
PK's arm above his head.

PK stands with Maria by the tree they use to climb over

MARIA
The Seniors Dance is two Saturdays

could escort me.
PK
Maria Marais with a rooinek at
the Senior Dance? What will
people think?
MARIA
They'll think what they think and
I'll think what I think.
PK
And what is that?
Maria touches his face.
Her eyes soften.
MARIA
I think I love you.
PK swallows hard.
They kiss and embrace.
PK caresses
her face.
PK
I would be honored to be your
escort.
Maria beams.
MARIA
I didn't doubt it for a minute.
Solly HONKS the HORN.
PK kisses Maria once more.
PK
I'll give you a boost.
PK stirrups his hands. Maria boosts up to the first
branch of the tree. She crests the wall.
MARIA
Thank you for tonight.
You were

MORRIE
You're up early, sir.
ST. JOHN
Best time for walking.
PK
Best time for running too, sir.
MORRIE
Have to put in the roadwork, sir.
You know, keep those legs strong.
St. John eyes the bruise on PK's cheek.
ST. JOHN
Yes.
Quite a fresh bruise there.
PK
I tripped.
ST. JOHN
Maybe you should change your
footwear.
He looks down at their shoes. Both boys are wearing pro-
per shoes; not at all what would be worn for roadwork.
ST. JOHN
To something a little more
appropriate for...

roadwork.
Busted, the boys squirm uncomfortably.

They both take off. Maria runs
as hard as she can. PK
catches up to her. She strains
with the effort. PK
crosses the finish line first.
Maria trips and falls,
rolling in the sand. PK comes
back to her. He kneels
down.
PK
You okay?
MARIA
You're supposed to let me win.
PK
Then you'd say I was being
condescending.
MARIA
You were guilty of that when you
gave me a head start.

She kisses him and stands up.
They begin to walk along
the beach.
MARIA
Get your formal yet?
PK grows uncomfortable.
PK
Uh... no.
MARIA
The dance is only a week away.
PK
Maria...

I can't come to the dance.
MARIA

PK
I have an obligation.
MARIA
Can't you change it?
PK
It's a permanent obligation.
Every Saturday night...

It starts tonight.
Maria cannot believe what she is hearing.
MARIA
You're breaking up with me.
PK
No.
MARIA
Then what could be so important
that it takes all your Saturday
nights?
PK
I really can't say.
Maria starts to cry.
She throws her arm around him.
MARIA
91.
P.K., I love you.
Please don't
go away.
PK
I'm not going away.
MARIA
Yes you are.
I can feel it.
PK
I'm not.
I'm just tutoring.
Maria pulls back.
PK
I started a school...

others in the seniors library.
Maria's sadness turns to anger.
MARIA
I'm losing you to a bunch of
kaffirs?
PK
You're not losing anything.
MARIA
No? Are you escorting me to the
dance? Are you going to see me on
the only free night they give us?
PK
Maria, this is important to me.
MARIA
And my life's important to me.
Damn you.
She runs off in tears.
A pained PK doesn't attempt to

On an escarpment high above the dense green rainforest
cover, PK and Doc move along the sheer cliff face with
photographic equipment and rucksacks.
PK notices Doc's labored breathing and slow movements.
They reach some small cacti growing out of the side of

the cliff in full bloom.
DOC
(breathing hard)
Ach.
You see how beautiful?
PK
You ever hear of glycerine, Doc?
DOC
Mr. Going-To-Oxford-Smarty-Pants.
Of course I know about glycerine.
Triglycerine. Biglycerine.
Monoglycerine. What do you want
to know?
PK
Why you don't use it. It's only
a little pill under the tongue.
DOC
Tongues were not made to put
little pills under. When I have
to start with that, I become
something else.
PK
Well, until you become something
else, the little pills would make
this easier on your heart.
A CLAP of THUNDER cuts into their conversation.
Thick
roiling rain clouds appear suddenly.
DOC
Little pills or no little pills
-- we don't find cover, we both
turn into something else.
Lightning splits the sky.
Rain begins to fall, pelting
the escarpment.
DOC
Look for a cave. Always in this
kind of rock there is caves.
Quick! Quick!
PK starts to move horizontally across the cliff face like
a spider on a wall. Doc follows. The rain becomes
torrential.
PK turns to look back at Doc.
DOC
Don't look at me.

He clasps Morrie's hand, first in a traditional hand-

PK (V.O.)
Dear Morrie.
Here is how it works.

Fights continually break out.
Off a play a fight breaks out. One of the men is kicked
unconscious. Two of his teammates carry him off the
field, dumping his body unceremoniously like a sack of
potatoes on the sidelines. They run back as play
resumes.
PK turns and walks back through the camp.
CUT TO:

A company-built miner's camp. Cement huts with steel
doors and corrugated roofs. No shrubbery, only dust,
cement, and the roughest-looking bunch of men assembled
on earth.
PK (V.O.)
Dear Morrie. To answer your
question: yes--sports are played
here, but only in the loosest
sense of the words "sport" and
"play". The rules are
different for everything, in
games as well as in the rest of
our lives. The managers, the
foremen, the company people.
They live apart from the miners.
They have families. Proper
gardens. Sunday dinners. The
miners--the crud, as we are called
-- don't. This is a society of
men, many of whom have pasts
better left behind. Future does
not apply. It is a society only
in the loosest sense of the word.
The laws of survival are simple--
you either do or you don't.
PK comes down a side street. A half a dozen men at
cards, hard-faced desperadoes, see him pass, eyeing him
closely. PK averts his eyes. From behind his back
comes the sound of LIPS PUCKERING loudly, indecently.
PK swallows hard. The sound of a CHARGE turns him to
the six men bolting from their card game after him,
whooping with lascivious intent. PK takes off.
The chase takes PK and his pursuers flying through the
streets of the camp, past one identical cement hut after
another.
People watch, disinterested. No one raises
a hand to help.
PK comes racing around the corner to three of the men
132.
blocking the street in front of him. He whirls. The
others catch up behind, yelling and hooting. The two
lines advance.
PK gets ready. When the first man is close enough he
hits him hard, breaking his jaw. He swings at another,
catching him flush in the face. But then the rest are
upon him. Even though PK fights like hell, he is
overwhelmed. The blows come from everywhere, beating
him to the ground. His arms and legs are firmly grabbed
by four men. He is banged hard face down onto a concrete
table. The fifth man pulls down his pants and the sixth
begins to undo his own fly. All the men scream obsceni-
ties, anticipating the rape.
PK struggles like hell to no avail. As he is about to
be violated, a roaring giant of a man tears into the
pack like a bear shredding dogs. He scatters the men,
knocking some unconscious, sending the rest to flight.
He stands over PK, a looming block of granite with a
wild black beard and coal-black eyes. His intent only
becomes clear as to whether he is claiming a prize or
helping a friend when he offers PK his hand, lifting PK
effortlessly.
He examines PK's bruised face with some concern and
then smiles.
PK
You know, Rasputin, I had them
right where I wanted them.
Another minute they were done
for.
Rasputin claps PK on the back and addresses him in
Russian, to which PK responds with a smile. The two men

Five Africans, all serious faces, keep their eyes firmly

different desperation--drought,
famine, locusts.
Satisfied with the equipment, PK nods for the box to be
closed.
ELIJAH, his head man, closes the boxes.
PK (V.O.)
They come and risk their
lives to
send money back home to

Take care, my friend.
He grasps Rasputin's bandaged hand to shake it.
Rasputin takes him around in a huge bear hug, smothering

The crowd goes silent as PK emerges. The crowd parts.
PK, looking neither right nor left, begins to walk away.
PK (V.O.)
I knew as I walked out of the
mines, out of Africa, that I
wasn't fleeing. That one day
I would return. Inkosi
Inkosikasi was right. I was a
man for all Africa. Bound to
her by my spirit. Bound by my
dreams. And Africa had taught
me the lesson I would take out
into the world and one day bring
back. Great changes can come from
the power of many. But only when
the many join together and create
what is invincible. The Power of
One.
ZOOM OUT as PK continues walking out of the camp and
toward tomorrow.
FADE OUT.
