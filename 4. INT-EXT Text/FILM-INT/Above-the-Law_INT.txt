on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes, drug vials
and surgical instruments. Zagon's hand picks up a hypodermic,
squirt-tests it.

20
TWO ASIAN PRISONERS
are on their knees, shirtless, handcuffed with heavy nylon
tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the
hooch. One of the subordinate CIT men moves in, grabs the
first prisoner by the shoulders. Zagon injects the first
prisoner. Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing.
Zagon watches with professional satisfaction.
ZAGON
That's the nice thing about modern
technology. You don't have to wait
for results.
He moves close to the first prisoner.
ZAGON
(to first prisoner)
Where is it, Charley? You got six tons
of our shit --
The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all
that comes out is a blood-curdling wail --
21
has moved as close to Zagon and the first prisoner as a fight
referee to two boxers. The prisoner is convulsing wildly.
Zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair.
ZAGON
Don't you die on me, fucker --
FOX
(from the side)
What the hell's wrong?
ZAGON
(throws the prisoner
down)
This pussy can't hold his liquor.
The first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm.
23
NICO
enters at this point. He takes in the scene quickly, moves
to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn't look at Nico,
but it's plain he is aware of Nico's presence. It is as if
he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove
it to the others, too.

24
FIRST PRISONER
dies in agony on the ground.
25
SECOND PRISONER
watches with eyes like flint. He is in his mid-forties,
scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or
higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes
since the French in the 50's. He is plainly one tough
customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if
daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the
prisoner with barely contained hatred. The prisoner doesn't
back down an inch.
ZAGON
(to second prisoner)
So my little doctor bag doesn't
*
scare you, eh? Well I don't need
*
it to open your yap.
*
Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a
fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and
a scalpel. He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the
blade in the lantern light.
26
NICO
watches impassively.
ZAGON (O.S.)
(to prisoner)
Where's our load, you sack of slime?
What did you do with my shit? --
27
ZAGON
punches
the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife
handle
in his fist to double the force of the blow and to
terrify
him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner
crashes
sideways, face bloody --
ZAGON
I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna
teach you never to fuck with my
opium --
28
FOX AND TWO CIT MEN
seem to know exactly what this is about.
29
NICO
didn't know, but the new kid on the block is catching on fast.
Nico has difficulty containing his emotion. Zagon stands
over the prisoner, as if daring him to get back up.
6.
The prisoner gets back to his knees, bloody eyes meeting
Zagon's with defiance --
ZAGON
(to prisoner)
You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy?
You took it from the Chinks... you took
it from the French. You'll be fucked
if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start
your gums flapping --
Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the
prisoner.
ZAGON
-- Well, you're gonna chirp for me,
tough guy. You're gonna sing like a
choir --
Nico takes a step toward Zagon.
NICO
What the fuck does this have to do
with military intelligence?
ZAGON
Your orders are 'assist and observe'
cherry --
Zagon turns to face Nico --
FOX
(to Nico)
Back off, partner --
Zagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner,
close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.
ZAGON
(to second prisoner)
I'm gonna start carving at your ankles.
We'll throw your feet in that box right
over there. Then I'm gonna take off
your arms --
One of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping
it to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't
flinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as
Zagon.
NICO
(can't take
much more)
Fox --
FOX
Shut up, Nico.
7.
ZAGON
You can disappear as easy as this
slope, kid --
Zagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade.
Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with
terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico.
Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a
ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally
comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops
in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men
move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing
his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico
out of the hooch --
30
A baptism in progress. Nico -- 15 years older than when we
last saw him, is standing beside SARA, his lovely wife
*
-- watching a 60-ish priest, FATHER GENARRO, finish the
final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest
straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth
around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and
relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in
uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro
with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's
garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from
all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm
around Sara.
*
33
Nico comes out of the bedroom, adjusting his shoulder
holster, tugging his jacket over it. He sees his mother
standing near the head of the stairs, just outside
another bedroom door. Concern on her face.
NICO
What are you doing in here, Mama?
Go join the party...
Nico comes down the hall, tucking in his shirt -- stops
to give his mother a squeeze. O.S. from the bedroom:
the sound of QUIET SOBBING. Nico glances in.
46
*
Sara and another woman sit on the bed, comforting a 60-ish
*
grandmother Zingaro, who is crying. Nico comes in. He
kneels before MRS. ZINGARO, concerned.
NICO
Mrs. Z.
(tries to be light)
Is this a way to act on the day of
my son's baptism?
The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes.
SARA
*
It's Lucy.
She's gone again.
Nico glances from Sara to Rosa.
*
Mrs. Zingaro shakes her head, choked with pain. Nico
holds her, looking over her shoulder toward Sara.
*
NICO
It's that kid from the bar on Damen?
The one with the drugs?

Sara doesn't know. Nico does.
He comforts Mrs. Zingaro
*
another moment, then stands.
NICO
Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you
listening?
(as the woman nods
miserably)
I have to go to work now. But
I'll come by tonight. You'll be
at the bakery?
MRS. ZINGARO
Si, Nico.
NICO
We'll talk, okay? We'll find a
way to take care of this.
Nico kisses Mrs. Z. He takes Sara's hand in goodbye,
*
starts for the door.
47
Nico is driving.
Jackson checks in on the radio.

"What are we
stopping at this dive for"?
NICO
I gotta take a quick leak. Stay
put.
He gets out of the car, starts for the bar.
53
*
Dim, smoke-choked, dangerous characters at the bar.
Nico
enters.
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87
15.
His silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working-
class attire of the bar's denizens. Hard faces check him out
subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a
photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head.
BAD DUDE
*
Why the fuck don't you assholes
*
leave me alone?
*
He continues mouthing off to Nico. Nico moves to one stool,
*
then another; the same exchange is repeated.
54
FAVOR ONE PARTICULARLY TOUGH CUSTOMER
*
A hulking bruiser with an earring.
He watches as --
55
NICO
approaches him. Three ARMY JACKETS look up sullenly.
Beefy arms, tattoos, greasy mustaches.
NICO
Gentlemen.
One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins
to pick his nose.
FIRST ARMY JACKET
(to others)
I thought this was a kosher bar.
They didn't allow no pork in here.
The two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar.
Nico holds out a photo of a young girl (Lucy).
NICO
You seen this girl?
SECOND ARMY JACKET
I seen the top of her head.
NICO
That's witty.
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87
15A.
Nico takes a step away, as if moving on to the next
stool. From behind the bar, the bartender swings a
*
sawed-off baseball bat into view. Other bodies move
*
ominously toward Nico. Suddenly he spins and, in a move
*
almost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right
out of its floor socket. Beer bottles fly, bodies crash.
Nico slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks
like his nose has exploded. Blood sprays onto Nico's silk
shirt. He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with
a shot that crushes three ribs. A savage elbow blasts the
third, head over heels, out over the bar and careening
into the sink. In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has
been put in cold storage. The rest of the bar is on its
feet. Four huge men confront Nico. Now five. Six.
Seven. Nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat-
tered; his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men --
NICO
Come on.
Show me something.
No one moves.

NICO
I get it.
It's a gay bar.
Is
that it?
The men, led by the Bad Dude, are shifting to surround
Nico. But no one attacks. Nico has Lucy's photo in his
hand. He jams it in one man's face, then another's, slap-
ping each one violently, spitting, raging for them to attack.
NICO
You seen the top of her head, huh?
Like I seen your mother's --
(to another guy)
Or was it yours?
(to a third)
Or yours?
(slaps him fero-
ciously)
I couldn't tell, it looked like
her ass --
Nico rages like a beast.
NICO
Come on, motherfuckers.
Do it.
Do it! One man --
Nico lunges for the Bad Dude, grabs him like he's about
to tear his face off --
BAD DUDE
Upstairs!
(in terror)
She's upstairs! 4-D!
Nico drags the Dude from behind the bar.
Holding him,
Nico turns, glowering, to all.
NICO
You cocksuckers are brave enough
with 14-year-old girls.

Nico throws Bad Dude down the hallway in front of him.

The door bursts in from a jackhammer kick. Nico stands
in the hallway. Bad Dude stands next to him; hurt,
shaking.

Nico grabs the Pimp by the scruff of the neck, lifting him
bodily. Lucy starts wailing in horror. Nico smashes the
Pimp's face down into a mirror with white powder on the
table --
NICO
That's two years.
He jerks the Pimp back, rips open a drawer.
More pills
and glacene bags.

The Pimp is dazed, bloody. Nico comes down with Lucy,
hauls the Pimp to his feet --
LUCY
Let him alone! He's beautiful!
NICO
Not when I get through with him.
Nico lifts the Pimp by the throat, pins him to the wall.
PIMP
No, man, wait! I'll give you
something! Something big!
LUCY
Please, Nico!
Don't!
PIMP
It's huge! I swear it! A
shipment... coming in next
Tuesday --
NICO
Shipment, my ass.
PIMP
This is square! On my mother's
soul! You can't send me up --
Nico glances to Lucy. Half of him wants to tear the
Pimp apart, the other half doesn't want to make the poor
girl's life any more tragic. Besides, he's a good cop
-- and maybe this "shipment" is on the level.
PIMP
I heard it from a hooker friend
of mine. She's banging some big
coke lawyer, he told her. I swear
to Jesus!
Nico relents -- a little.
NICO
What lawyer?
PIMP
I don't know.

Nico at the wheel has just pulled away from the bakery.
Jackson, in the passenger seat, studies her partner for a
few moments, shaking her head at the contradictions in this
man. Educated, classy, an elegant dresser -- yet underneath
an out-and-out wild man.
JACKSON
I don't get you, Toscani.

What the hell are you doing being a
shitheel cop? With your background?
For a long moment Nico says nothing.
Then, quietly, look-
ing straight ahead:

When I was overseas, I saw some
things. Things that eat your guts
out. Things that stay in front of
your eyes like they were burned in
and branded.
He turns to Jackson.

You can walk away from them, Jax.
You can quit, but you know it's
still going on. You try something
anyway --

You can see your client. As soon

Hookers, female addicts, etc. in the downtown "cage."
Nico has the girl in the red dress and lizard shoes
(CARLA DECARLO) out in the hallway adjacent to the lock-
up. Nico is Mr. Charm, offering her a heart-shaped box
of chocolates.
NICO
Carla... Carla -- I just want the
name of your boyfriend --
CARLA
I got 200 boyfriends.
The hooker, Carla DeCarlo, slaps the box away, cursing in
Spanish.

CARLA
Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon!
Some of the chocolates tumble onto the lockup floor, the
detainees snap them up, start munching. The girl con-
tinues to spit curses at Nico, gesturing with her hands
with Latin flamboyance. Nico grabs her by the elbow, as
a jailer opens the lockup door. More curses are being
flung at Nico from various females in the cage. Nico
heaves Carla in among them. Carla flops down on a bench
next to a tall black hooker. MOVE IN ON the black hooker.
It's Nico's partner, Jackson, dolled up like a street-
walker, playing her undercover role to the hilt.
JACKSON
(to Nico)
Why can't you sons-a-bitches ever
treat someone with a little
respect?
NICO
(walking away)
Take it easy, sister.
JACKSON
I ain't your goddamn sister.

Carla fires one final parting salvo of obscenities, then
sags back among the women. Carla starts to cry. Jackson
comforts her; Carla responds, lets herself be comforted.

Jackson checks her makeup in the rearview mirror. Nico

stakeout.

look at him. I couldn't get how
he's connected, but according to

BOOTH NEAR BACK HALLWAY
The owner's table. Stacks of dining checks, a cashbox
and calculator, full ashtrays, wine glasses. BAUTISTA
SALVANO, a heavyset, swarthy Venezuelan dressed in a tux
with the collar open, glowers across the table at a mus-
cular, scar-faced Latin busboy -- the kind who looks like
he does more for his boss than clean up the tables. The
busboy (NARDO) is nervous, apologetic --

muscles, Nardo, not your mouth.
NARDO

I'm sorry, boss.
SALVANO
Your English is getting good...
You're showing it off. Showing it
off on the street --
NARDO
I keep quiet.
I never talk no
more --
Salvano glowers at Nardo like he's about to punch him.
Instead he reaches over, playfully chokes the busboy --
then releases him, as if all is forgiven.
SALVANO
Make yourself useful.
(indicates empty
wine bottle on
table)
Get downstairs, bring me one of
these.

starts for back

Then get back to work.

He trots down into the empty basement, toward a floor-to-
ceiling wine rack.
NARDO
(to himself)
I thought I was dead, man.
(whistles with
relief)
I thought I was fucking dead.
He crosses to the wine rack. It's dark, hard to see.
He searches for the bottle. Suddenly: a METALLIC sound
behind him. Nardo turns -- CHI CHI TESTAMENTE, a wiry,
pock-faced Latino, stands in the shadows (it is clear he
has been waiting there, hiding) -- holding a small
silencer automatic.

Chi SHOOTS him AGAIN; Nardo drops like a stone. Coolly,
professionally, Chi Chi pumps FOUR more SHOTS into the
prone busboy's head. Chi Chi ejects the clip into his
palm, unscrews the silencer, holsters the gun. Salvano
appears at the top of the stairs. Two busboys are behind
him. One of them is the young pimp. The busboys hurry

down, the pimp -- scared shitless but playing it macho-cool. *
Salvano comes down the stairs. Chi Chi stands over his work.

The place is packed with fashionable people of all races.
A band plays salsa; couples dance. Nico and Jackson pass
easily as a hip "uptown" couple. A pretty Latin HOSTESS
approaches them.
HOSTESS

Two for drinks.
They elbow up to the packed bar, standing.
Nico squints
toward the rear dining room.

NICO'S POV - DOWN BAR
Looking past numerous patrons, we see Chi Chi whisper
something to a waiter and take a seat at a rear table
(the same "owner's table" where Salvano sat before.)
The waiter hurries off into a back hallway.

NICO AND JACKSON - AT BAR
Jackson moves to the salsa beat.
A BARMAID approaches.

Gimme something stiff.
I need it.

From the back hallway Salvano emerges -- in his tux,
looking prosperous. He sits down beside Chi Chi and
Abandano. A waitress brings two drinks. After a few
words, Chi Chi removes the scrap of paper from his pocket,
hands it to Salvano.

Salvano and Chi Chi dive below the dash and continue
forward. Salvano, in the passenger seat, raises his GUN;
FIRES blindly -- trying to hit Nico.
112
Salvano can't believe it. He screams something in
Spanish. He FIRES again, this time through the roof.
115
The engine block sits in a wooden shipping frame, wrapped
with industrial plastic. Nico climbs into the van, rips
the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the
shipping frame, tears them off. In the background,
ambulances are arriving to care for the wounded cops
and criminals.

(into phone)
-- count on it, sir. Right.
You'll have our full cooperation.
Neeley hangs up. Glances dubiously to Halloran. Then turns
*
grimly to Salvano, Chi Chi and the lawyer Abandano.
AGENT NEELEY
*
You're free to go.

132
OPENING ON Agent Neeley's face. Composed, clean-cut, but
*
intense, wearing a light-colored business suit. PAN TO
Agent Halloran -- the same upright, clean-shaven bureau look.
The two men are seated to one side of LIEUTENANT FRED STROZAH.
133
NICO, JACKSON, LUKICH AND DEA AND ATF MEN
sit and stand in various postures in front of the Lieutenant's
desk.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH
(to Nico, DEA & AIF)
-- This is no reflection on the
work you officers have done. I
feel, and the whole department
feels, extremely proud of your
initiative and gallantry.
That "spare me the horseshit" look on Nico's face. He's
fuming. Strozah sees Nico's bitter expression. It's on
the others' faces too.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH
As all of you
are well aware,
possession of
these explosives
is a federal
offense and under
jurisdiction
of the F.B.I.
Nico's eyes meet Lieutenant Strozah's. There's respect
between the two, but it's plainly under a helluva strain.
NICO
Sir. With all respect to our
brothers in the Bureau --
(biting sarcasm;
turns to Neeley)
*
-- That's no answer. It's no
answer to why one of the biggest
dealers in the city is out on the
street now, free as a bird!
Agent Neeley stiffens.
*
LIEUTENANT STROZAH
Keep it in your pants, Nico.
These men have a job to do, just
like us.
Nico stifles his outrage. The other cops exchange glances
-- upset and angry. Agent Neeley clears his throat.

AGENT NEELEY
*
Lieutenant, I think these officers
are entitled to a fuller
explanation.

AGENT NEELEY (CONT'D)
They've risked their lives. I

hospital.
He speaks to the officers.
AGENT NEELEY
*
What I'm about to say doesn't
leave this room. Is that clear?
Assent from everyone.
AGENT NEELEY
*
Mr. Salvano has been working for
some time in cooperation with
certain federal agencies.
134
CLOSE - NICO'S FACE
Stunned and furious at this royal fuck-up.
AGENT NEELEY (O.S.)
*
I'm not at liberty to divulge
the nature of Mr. Salvano's
involvement -- I just learned of
its existence myself a few hours
ago. But one thing I can tell you --
135
BACK TO AGENT NEELEY
*
AGENT NEELEY
*
Mr. Salvano's role is crucial to
an extremely sensitive ongoing
investigation. Any further
surveillance, harassment, or
unauthorized operations against
this individual are forbidden.
I must order you gentlemen --
(looking straight at
Nico)
-- with all respect for your work
and your courage, to stand down.
Lukich shakes his head; Nico is devastated.
Jackson takes
it all in.
CUT TO:
136
OPENING CLOSE ON a desk drawer being opened. Aside from
rounds of ammo, notes and an aging eggplant parmigiana
sandwich, there are half a dozen hand-labeled audio-
cassettes and a small collection of miniaturized bugging
devices. Jackson and Lukich watch Nico take out the
notes, hand them to Lieutenant Strozah.

LIEUTENANT STROZAH
The tapes too.
NICO
(mocking)
That's my Lawrence Welk
collection!
LIEUTENANT STROZAH
I want everything you got on this
one.
Reluctantly, Nico hands over the tapes.
The Lieutenant eyes
the bugs and wires.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH
I know you don't give a shit
about yourself, Toscani.
(a glance to Jax)
But you're gonna put Jackson's
ass in a sling, too, with these
illegal wires.

OTHER SIDE OF SQUAD ROOM
Agent Halloran edges up to Jackson, who's grabbing coffee
on the far side of the squad room, and watching from there
as Nico gives Strozah more of a hard time.
AGENT HALLORAN
What's the story on your partner,
Jackson? Did he learn this style
or was he born with a brick up his
ass?
Jackson checks Halloran out. He's black too and, despite
herself, there's a certain rapport.
JACKSON
He has ethics. Unlike certain
others on this case.
Halloran watches the illegal bugs and tapes come out of
Nico's drawer.
AGENT HALLORAN
His 'ethics' are gonna cost him
his badge and his gun.
This "white" talk gives Jackson a pain.
She slips into
her jive mode.
JACKSON
You don't wanna catch him without
no gun.
Halloran's look asks why not?
JACKSON
'Cause what he do with his hands...
make bullet holes look pretty.
Across the room, Nico turns over the tapes.
AGENT HALLORAN
He bad?
JACKSON
Bad bad.

137
Nico and Jackson come down the stairs. Jackson has had
ample excitement for her last week on the force.
JACKSON
Is that enough? Can we do
something normal now -- like
eat lunch?
NICO
Anything you say, Jax.
How
about Salvano's?
JACKSON
Let it be, Nico.
138
Jackson and Nico are eating some fast good.
Nico reaches
to his jacket pocket; takes out a cassette.
JACKSON
What... you kept his tape, too?
Nico already has it in the PLAYER. We hear FRAGMENTS
of the telephone tap from the body shop in Spanish and
English. Jackson looks frustrated. Nico listens care-
fully to what appears to be the taped PHONE CONVERSATION.
NICO
Poetry, ain't it?
140
Nico and Jackson case the restaurant from down the alley.
142
A smattering of older women and men praying. Salvano and
Chi Chi stop at the head of the aisle, genuflect to the
altar, move in, take seats toward the front.
149
BACK OF CHURCH
Nico and Jackson slip in the front door, glide silently
into the shadows at the rear of the church.
JACKSON
This is your mother's church,
isn't it?
NICO
Yeah. But I bet she's never seen
these boys in the choir.
150
NICO'S POV
Salvano's head is bowed, but Chi Chi is looking around
quite carefully. Nico and Jackson fade into the shadows
behind the huge pillars.
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87
37A.
151
SALVANO AND CHI CHI
After a few moments, the pair rises. They cross them-
selves, start out for the front door. As they walk, they
continue to look for something.
152
*
Nico and Jackson emerge into a courtyard which reveals a
day care center and a rectory. They head toward the front
of the building. Jackson, planning on picking up their
tail on Salvano, is stoped by Nico. He wants to stay and
look around.
38.
FATHER GENARRO (O.S.)
Nicola! That can't be you in
church without the family!
Nico turns to see Father Genarro, perspiring in a baggy
sweatshirt, a handball glove on his hand. The courtyard
alongside the church is marked off as an athletic area.
NICO
Father Genarro.
The priest seizes Nico's hand warmly, smiles at Jackson.
FATHER GENARRO
This must be your partner in
crime.
(shakes her hand)
I'm Father Genarro. I saw you at
the baptismal party.
(with a wink to Nico)
What a partner.
JACKSON
Dolores Jackson
(smiling, but
impatient)
Nico, we gotta go --
FATHER GENARRO
No, please --
(more serious now)
It's good you stopped by. I have
to show you something. Please.
The priest begins leading Nico and Jackson. Jackson keeps
glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly
driving by.
153
This is an old building. The dark corridors resemble an
underground bunker. Old trophies and furniture are stored
along the walls. The two cops and the priest walk.
Another priest emerges from a door, nods, passes. Nico
and Jackson glance in through the door as they walk.
They reach a door with a broken handle. It looks like a
break-in has taken place.
FATHER GENARRO
The rats are getting bigger.
NICO
When did this happen?
FATHER GENARRO
Two nights ago. I didn't call
the police.
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87
39.

Father Genarro knocks on the door, pauses, then knocks
again. The door opens. A twelve-year-old who looks like
he's from Central America stands in the doorway.
FATHER GENARRO
(in Spanish)
It's all right, son. These are
friends.
The boy steps back and we MOVE INTO --
154
A largish room, no exposed windows, everything boarded up.
Newly-constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner,
various cots. A number of LATIN REFUGEES -- families mostly
-- react shyly as Father Genarro introduces Nico and Jackson.
Sister Bonifacia is there, and a youthful priest, FATHER
TOMASSINO. We will see both of them again.
FATHER GENARRO
(referring to the cops)
These are friends.
(to Nico)
This is Father Tomassino.
FATHER TOMASSINO
How do you do?
Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment
between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what
he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father
Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave.
155
NICO, JACKSON AND FATHER GENARRO
continue down the hall.
JACKSON
I didn't know this church was a
sanctuary, Father.
FATHER GENARRO
Yes. But, perhaps not such a
safe one.
NICO
How long have they been here?
FATHER GENARRO
Too long. At least the kids can
go to our school.
NICO
Who did it, Father?
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87
39A.
FATHER GENARRO
Kids, maybe.
(significantly)
Maybe worse. It's not the first
time.
JACKSON
We can have a car check by, every
hour.
FATHER GENARRO
No... please.
Police frighten
these people.
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87

156
*
The three are outside, taking their leave. A big smile
and a hand on Father Genarro's shoulder. The priest is
greatly relieved.
NICO
Really, I don't mind coming by.
FATHER GENARRO
Tell me, Nico... When was your
last confession?
NICO
I'm a married man, Father.
I've
got no sins to confess.
FATHER GENARRO
You're a police officer, you have
many sins to confess.
JACKSON
Amen.
Nico and Jackson start off.
FATHER GENARRO
(calls after Nico)
You come back Sunday. I feel
better when I see Nicola in
church.
(calls louder)
You don't show, I'm phoning your
mother!
DISSOLVE TO:

dressed in their Sunday best fill the sidewalk, filing in

An Italian neighborhood becoming more Hispanic. As the
churchgoers file in, we see families -- women, kids,
babies.

NICO, SARA, ROSA AND JULIAN

are among the crowd, exchanging pleasantries with friends
and neighbors -- in English, Italian and Spanish.

Sara, holding Julian, slips into a pew. As Nico and Rosa
*
follow, Father Genarro passes, heading for the front.
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87

Father Genarro! I have you to thank

It's amazing what shame can
accomplish.
Father Genarro smiles and continues on toward the pulpit.

sing with full gusto.
D)
THE CHOIR MASTER
makes the sign to be seated.
E)
CONGREGATION
sits. We notice a
young, intellectual-looking man
(Alan Singletary)
wearing wire-rim glasses, sitting in
the front row. We
will see his face again later. He
looks out of place
and glances around, surprised as...
F)
FATHER GENARRO
moves into the pulpit, opens his Bible.
FATHER GENARRO
In nomine patris, filius et

162
SARA AND JULIAN
*
The little one starts to CRY; she comforts him. Nico
reaches over to try to help. The BABY continues FUSSING.
Nico looks toward the priest and the front of the church.
He notices a woman in a black shawl rise from the front
of the church and turn, heading down one of the side
aisles.
SARA
*
(examines Julian's
diaper)
Way to go, Julian -- perfect timing.

She cynically smiles at Nico. Nico sees the woman in
black pass toward the exit of the church.
163
CLOSEUP - WOMAN
It is the same woman Nico and Jackson were following with
Abandano, the lawyer!
164
CLOSEUP - LARGE SHOPPING BAG
The woman has left it in front of the votive candles
directly before the priest's pulpit.

His head spins from the shopping bag to the doorway --

The woman is hastily sneaking out.
167
BACK TO NICO
Instantly he pushes his family to the floor, covering
them with his body.
168
CLOSEUP - NICO - SECOND LATER
BOOM!!!
A POWERFUL EXPLOSION erupts between the priest
and his
congregation. Fragments of plaster, wood, and
marble
come blasting past Nico and his family! Churchgoers
in the
first rows are blown off their feet by the shock
wave of
the blast. Pews overturn, smoke everywhere --
169
CHOIR
is shrieking hysterically. Stone and plaster dust rain
down on them from the ceiling.
170
CONGREGATION
is in total pandemonium.
Screams, cries, panic --
171
PULPIT
has been blown to oblivion. Where Father Genarro had
been standing is now nothing but smoke and rubble.

Everyone is down, reeling from the concussion, dust and
smoke. Nico rises alone from this scene.
NICO
(forcefully)
Help each other move outside.
Be
calm.
175
Nico on his feet, plainly the leader in this moment of
terror. Worshippers, shattered and bleeding, pour past
him toward the door. Nico grabs a stout-looking church-
goer.
NICO
Call 911. Tell 'em to send
everything they got!
(turns to his wife)
Sara, get the baby and Mama
*
outside.
Nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst.
177
Nico appears through the backlit smoke and kneels over
the bloodied body of Father Genarro. He desperately tries
to maintain the priest's life.
CUT TO:
181
The aftermath of the blast. Doctors and nurses have the
scene more of less under control, but there's still plenty
of pain and misery.
182
Nico stands, his back to the wall -- a scary, blank look
on his face. A doctor and several nurses are pulling the
plugs on the terribly mutilated body of Father Genarro.
A nun is crying; a fellow priest is blessing the Father.
183
JACKSON
arrives.
Nico talks to her, aside.
NICO
I want a list of everyone that's
been treated here today. Everyone.
JACKSON
Right.
NICO
Then find those sanctuary people,
the ones we saw in the church
basement --
As Jackson makes notes.
NICO
Find out where they're from, why
anyone would want to harm them.
Jackson flips her notepad shut, ready to go.
JACKSON
Where are you gonna be?
NICO
Just stay near a radio.
I'll find
you.
184
Sits on a bench with a bandage over one eye. Sara
*
and Julian are sleeping beside her. Nico kneels beside
his mother, deeply concerned. Nico takes his mother's
arm, helps her to her feet.

Sara wakes and picks up Julian. Mama knows Father Genarro
*
has died. She begins sobbing softly. Other members of
the congregation are in the hallway, mourning. Nico, with
his family, takes several steps toward the exit. Suddenly,
Nico stops. He sees Agent Neeley entering (the FBI man who
*
ordered him off the case) accompanied by Lieutenant Strozah
*
and two uniformed officers.
NICO
Sara... go down to the car; I'll
*
be with you in a minute.
He hails Neeley.
*
NICO
I need to talk to you.
(a glance to Strozah
and others)
... Alone.
Neeley nods. Nico leads him off the corridor, through a
*
fire exit door --
185
STAIRWELL LANDING
The door closes behind them. Nico and the FBI man are
alone on the stairway landing.
AGENT NEELEY
*
(impatient)
What the hell is it, Toscani?
Without warning, Nico grabs Neeley by both lapels, slams
*
him furiously into the wall!
NICO
You.
That's what the hell it is!
AGENT NEELEY
*
Get your goddam hands off me!
Neeley tries to shake free; Nico won't let him.
*
NICO
You let Salvano walk.
AGENT NEELEY
*
Salvano?! Are you crazy?
(rips himself free)
What does he have to do with this?
NICO
That was no cherry bomb in there.
That was C-fucking-4!

his rage)
I've used that shit.

AGENT NEELEY
*
Salvano never came near that C-4.
It's in federal holding now!
Besides, why would he blow up a
church?
NICO
I tailed Salvano. Two days ago.
Him and one of his apes were in
that church -- and they weren't
taking communion. I saw some broad
saw who was with his lawyer plant
the bomb. Now I want some goddamn
answers.
AGENT NEELEY
*
You tailed him? After I ordered
you off?
NICO
Where is he?
Where's Salvano?
AGENT NEELEY
*
My orders were release him.
Not
babysit him.
Neeley brushes Nico's fingermarks off his lapels.
*
AGENT NEELEY
*
You think you're rough stuff,
Toscani -- martial arts hero, chop
suey crap. Well I'll tell you
something: you're not bullet-
proof. You're not even a good
cop.
(composes himself;
reclaims his dignity)
You sneak around, playing your
street dick games. But all you
come up with is conjecture, wild
coincidence and bullshit.

the explosives.

MONTAGE WITH SCORE
A)
*
Nico storms through toward the restaurant rear. The
employees are getting ready for the evening crowd. He
flashes his badge, checks the kitchen, Salvano's
office.
The man is gone.
C)
Jackson has her list from the hospital.
A coroner and
his assitant show her a body on a slab.
The body is
that of Alan Singletary, the man we saw
in the front

row of the church. Jackson takes notes.
The dead man

is definitely not the ethnic type you'd
expect in St.
Mary's congregation.
D)
Machete Man highballs off the sidewalk, straight into a
Mom and Pop groceria. Customers scatter in shock as the
hood blasts past them, out the back door. Here comes
Nico. Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past --
196
Nico at the kitchen table spread with notepads, old add-
ress books, 3X5 cards. He's on the phone, impatient,
apparently getting nowhere. He slams the phone down.
B)
Nico paces, phone cradled to ear, talking urgently.
CLICK: he's been hung up on; he looks at the receiver
in frustration and disgust.
C)

Nico back at the table, listening to the wiretap
tape, transcribing it.
F)
ANOTHER ANGLE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER)
Nico holds Julian, goes over notes.
G)
CLOSE - YELLOW LEGAL PAD
The page is headed: "FATHER GENARRO." Below in
doodle formation, are a series of boxes, each one
containing a phrase. We read: "Father G had some-
thing on Salvano?" "Church break-in?" "Drug infor-
mation?" "Father G connected to FBI?" Irritably,
Nico's pencil crosses everything out.

NICO
Of course I will. I've been waiting
to hear from Jax. She was supposed
to get back to me by now.
202
Nico comes in with his arms around Sara. She stops
near the bed, holds him tight. They look to little
Julian sleeping in the crib nearby.
SARA
Thank God you couldn't find your
shoes. We would of have been
sitting in the front row.
(beat)
Alright, I know the rules -- I
don't ask you don't tell. But
could've died today and I deserve
to know.
(beat)
Why did we go to church this
morning?
NICO
I'm willing to break
the rules;
I'm willing to tell
you whatever
I know. But I need
some time.
Could you just give
me some time?
Nico leans to kiss her, but is cut off by the HARSH RING
of a PHONE. Sara starts at the sound. She and Nico
glance at each other --
SARA
I'll bet that's her.
Nico picks up the phone.
NICO
(into phone)
This better be good, Jax.
MAN (V.O.)
(filtered)
It's bad, Nico.
Nico glances to Sara. The voice on the
phone is not
Jackson. Nico is chilled. He glances
to Sara, finger to
his lips. He points to his bare wrist
as if wanting to know
the exact time. Sara, not sure what's
going on, mouths:
"Two-fifteen."

out of bed. His gun appears in his hand, as if from nowhere,
he steps quickly to the front window, looks out --

Two unmarked cars pull in.

He moves swiftly to the rear window and spots another un-

Nico enters the vestibule in his pajama bottoms with his gun
in his hand.
VOICE THROUGH DOOR (O.S.)
F.B.I., Toscani. Open up.
Nico pulls aside a curtained glass panel; he recognizes
two uniformed police officers, plus Neeley and Halloran,
*
the FBI agents who authorized the release of Salvano. He
lowers his gun, opens the door. The cops surge in.
NICO
(to one of cops)
It's a little early for breakfast,
O'Hara.
O'HARA
Sorry, Nico.
(displays warrant)
You're under arrest.

gun)
I'll take this, thank you.
Before Neeley can get his hand on the gun, Nico, without

to you.

is hurriedly getting dressed. A cop and the FBI agents
stand at the door.
SARA
*
(to cops; distraught)
This is ridiculous -- there's
no need for this!
NICO
It's all right, darling.
Two agents enter the room carrying Nico's confiscated
papers and tapes and begin rummaging through dressers,
jewelry boxes and closets. Rosa crosses swiftly to calm
Sara.

ROSA
(to cops)
Who do you think you are --
coming in here like this,
treating my son like a criminal?

Why are you terrifying us?
There's an infant here!
Nico pulls on a jacket. He looks like he could kill.
He
restrains himself for his family's sake.

Check that coat.
The cops cross to frisk Nico.
Sara, still holding the baby,

starts slapping at them.

Get your hands off him!

Bad Dude, the bartender we remember from Nico's first
visit to the Polish bar, finishes signing a deposition.
A cop takes the paper. Bad Dude stands, glances half-
fearfully, half-defiantly to Nico, who is led down a hall-
way flanked by two uniformed officers. Agent Halloran
opens the door for Bad Dude, who exits.

Nico comes out of his chair, going for Halloran.
Strozah
tries to block him, but it's useless.

Nico! You damn fool! You wanna
go to prison?!
Nico stops. He's speechless with rage.

Nico contains his fury. He steps away from Strozah, with
a gesture that says "I won't hurt you."
NICO
(to Strozah)
Fred.
You can't be in on this.
Nico faces his lieutenant -- a look that calls on long

years of comradeship and loyalty. Strozah is torn. He's
a good man, over his head in a situation he doesn't com-
pletely understand.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH

OPENING CLOSE ON the faces of the sanctuary refugees.
They are faces that have known fear and tragedy. The kind
of faces we see on newsreels after villages have been
burned and family members murdered. The refugees have
been moved from church basement to a back room in the day
care center. Nico kneels, facing them. Jackson in the
background. A nun (SISTER BONIFACIA) and a priest (whom
we saw in Genarro's hospital room) watch over the people.
Nico is frustrated; he can't crack the refugees' fear.
NICO
(to nun)
Sister... you know me. Tell them
there's no need for fear.
61.
SISTER BONIFACIA
There is rubble all over the yard,
Nicola.
(THE REST OF THE SCENE MAY BE IN ENGLISH, OR SPANISH WITH
SUBTITLES, AT THE DIRECTOR'S DISCRETION.)
NICO
(to refugees)
I was there... in the church.
They tried to kill my family, too.
Several of the refugees look like they want to speak, but
they are terrified.
NICO
I know there was a man here, from
an American senator's office. Who
was he going to speak to?
The refugees become increasingly anxious.
NICO
(to one woman)
Was it you, senora?
(to a man)
Was it you?
More silence.
Glances among the people.
Finally:
REFUGEE WOMAN
The priest.
The others shrink.
The Woman glances to them.
NICO
Who?
(gently)
Father Genarro?
REFUGEE WOMAN
The other one.
Nico looks to the American priest standing there.
REFUGEE WOMAN
No. The young one. From Costa
Rica.
Sister Bonifacia sighs.
SISTER BONIFACIA
Father Tomassino.
Jackson has her pad out, taking notes. Bonifacia knows
too much has already been revealed; she must speak.
62.
SISTER BONIFACIA
He came alone... two weeks ago.
He had papers. Papers to give to
the senator.
Nico tries to contain his excitement; not scare anyone by
losing his calm.
NICO
But the bomb... The bomb was
planted to destroy the pulpit.
SISTER BONIFACIA
Father Tomassino was going to
give the Mass that day.
(shaken)
Father Genarro talked him out of
it.
The refugees' faces confirm this.
NICO
(understands)
It was Father Tomassino they were
trying to kill.
Bonifacia starts softly to cry.
Nico puts his hand on her
shoulder, comforting her.
NICO
Where is Tomassino?
Where is he
now?
The nun shakes her head.
Nico looks to the refugees.
They don't know, either.
REFUGEE MAN
He run, mister. He go --
He gestures: "who knows where?"
NICO
If you know where he is, you've
got to tell me. I want to help
him. I can help him.
The refugees lower their eyes. Bonifacia continues her
soft weeping. Nico glances to Jackson; her look says
"Enough, let's leave these poor people alone." Nico
stands, touches Bonifacia one more time on the shoulder --
218
Nico drives, a jumble of emotions on his face.
Urgency
fear, exhaustion. He's deep in thought --
220
Nico's car pulls up at a stop light. He looks around
without really seeing. An old lady pulls a shopping cart
*
while a crossing guard takes some kids across the street.

221
ANOTHER CAR
ROARS up out of nowhere, without two men inside, SCREECH-
ING to a stop head-on to Nico's door. Its doors spring

FOUR MEN
As their magazines empty. The last shells spring free,
GUN BARRELS SIZZLE, blue smoke fills the air. The leader
waves two men forward to check their kill. At that
instant:
233
NICO
springs to his feet behind the men, the Sig Saur .45
*
clutched in both hands. (He has crawled under both cars
to envelop his attackers.)
NICO
Over here, you sons-a-bitches!
Nico's rage is superhuman. The men stare in conster-
nation. One of the men has a fresh magazine half into
his weapon --
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87
65.
NICO
(eyes like an
animal)
Try it. Be my guest.
The man lets the magazine clatter to the street. The
others raise their hands. It takes all Nico's strength
to keep from wasting all four of them on the spot. His
gaze swings wildly around the intersection. He spots a
corner grocery store. A phone inside.
NICO
(gestures with gun)
Over there! Move it! -- Now!!
The men are scared shitless. They put their hands in
back of their heads; trot jelly-legged --
234
A Pakistani counter clerk takes one look at the mob enter-
ing his store and bolts for the rear. A customer exits
as Nico herds his captives in.
NICO
Hands on the counter!
Three men do it; the fourth is slow.
NICO
Don't tempt me, ASSHOLE --
The fourth obeys. Nico moves to the pay phone on the
wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re-
*
ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes
his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men
sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his
eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again
to the dial -- A free-standing sales display hurtles
toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men
has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a
second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering
into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet.
One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the
freezer doors -- Wham! -- smack into the man's face. The
GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's
three against one -- prime odds for Nico. He wades into
his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails
into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land
a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered
forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker --
235

It looks like a tornado has hit the interior. Magazine

Sara is at the dresser, pulling open drawers, dumping her

She pulls out a handgun and ammo from her panty drawer. She
starts to weep. Nico steps up behind her, puts his arms
around her.
NICO
You'll be safe with Uncle Branca.
It's gotta be this way... I'm sorry.
He turns her around to face him.

He holds her passionately.

They killed the wrong priest.
Lukich doesn't understand.

There was a second priest... from
Costa Rica... hiding at the church.
He was the one they meant to kill.
Nico starts to remove a large piece of ducting from the
basement heater.
LUKICH
And you know where to find him?
NICO
No.
The hole in the foundation holds several shotguns and a
couple of pistols, some passports and some cash.
LUKICH
You're gonna need help.
Nico grabs the pistols, starts to strap them on.

computer manufacturer. Dr. Watanabe (Nico's friend whom
we remember from the baptism/picnic scene) is the chief

you through hell.

In the shadows by the corner, a hulking Latino man loiters.

JACKSON (O.S.)

That's an eyeball if I ever saw one.

296B
BACK TO CAR
*
Nico starts to open the car door.
Jackson moves to join him. *
NICO
You're our backup. If we come out
running, then you can shoot.
Nico's eyes meet his partner's. It's plain he'll break her
leg if he has to, to keep her safe by the car. Jackson
accepts this reluctantly.
81.
297
Father Tomassino is beginning to come under the influence of
Zagon's chemicals. In spite of this the priest's spirit to
resist is astounding...
ZAGON
Speak to me, Father -- who did you tell?
FATHER TOMASSINO
I know what you are. I know what
beasts you are.
299
The drugs have taken hold. The priest's brain is an open
memory bank for Zagon to probe.
ZAGON
I want to know who you told.
FATHER TOMASSINO
(barely coherent)
I told them... you make the ninos...
see... castrating their fathers --
raping... mutilating their mothers
... And...
(breaks down crying)
... and sometimes... to the ninos...

NICO'S POV - HALLWAY
As he slowly pushes the door open.
The hallway is empty.

Nico and Lukich pad in.

Quickly Lukich checks the stairs leading down. Nico crosses
silently past the first apartment door, checks the far end of
the hallway. Nico comes back toward the apartment door.
Lukich approaches from the opposite side. They take up
positions flanking the door, guns drawn. The LOUD MUSIC
CONTINUES from inside.
304
INSIDE APARTMENT
Salvano and Chi Chi look on, revulsed. Whatever is happening
to Father Tomassino is enough to make even cruel men ill.
ZAGON (O.S.)
-- Tell me the truth, Father --
The priest's eyes roll grotesquely; he convulses, sweat
beading on his forehead. He looks like a man in the agonies
of some narcotic hell.
ZAGON
(close to priest)
-- Can we kill him? If you told anyone,
about our plans to kill the senator,
we cannot do it.
FATHER TOMASSINO
Nadie.
Nadie. Nadie.

NICO AND LUKICH IN HALLWAY
O.S. we hear another ELEVATED TRAIN APPROACHING outside.
Nico kicks the apartment door in! He and Lukich burst in,
guns clutched two-handed.
306
QUICK CUTS
The first goon reacts, raises his pistol. Lukich SHOOTS him.
Nico NAILS the second goon, just as Chi Chi aims his sawed-
off pistol-grip shotgun at Nico. Nico has a split second to
dive behind a heavy upholstered chair. Chi Chi's DOUBLE-
BARREL BLAST blows the chair into powder. Almost instan-
taneously Nico sees the priest -- just as Zagon slashes the
priest's throat! Salvano SHOOTS Lukich point blank, in the
shoulder, sending Lukich's gun sailing. Nico, FIRING, grabs
Lukich, dives out the door with him --
307
HALLWAY
Zagon and Salvano OPEN FIRE from the apartment full-tilt.
BULLETS RIP through the WALL, BLASTING WOOD and PLASTER
everywhere. Nico shoves Lukich toward the stairwell --
NICO
Go!
Go!
-- Simultaneously FIRING back through the kicked-in door,
EMPTYING his GUN.
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87
83.
ZAGON
(in Spanish, from
apartment)
Get him! Finish him!
Nico is slamming a fresh clip in, Lukich is stumbling away
toward the stairwell. Salvano and Chi Chi appear in the
apartment doorway. Chi Chi levels his fierce "hogleg" at
Nico's head. At that instant -- A broadside of BULLETS slam
into the wall around Chi Chi. It's Jackson -- on the stairs!
Chi Chi is hit, but spins, FIRES. His shotgun blast catches
Jackson square in the chest, blowing her back like a doll,
down the stairwell, out of sight. Nico reacts with agony,
*
twists on the floor, SHOOTS Chi Chi in the face. Nico pulls
the trigger as fast as he can, sending a HAIL of FIRE through
the doorway, through the walls. Salvano clutches his hench-
man, using his dead body as a shield; Nico's BULLETS blow Chi
Chi apart. Zagon FIRES back, hits Nico in the side by the
ribs! Nico tries to fire back; he's empty!
ZAGON
Now!
Nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof, clawing for a new
clip as he goes. Salvano and Zagon burst into the hallway,
SHOOTING at Nico.

Nico over the sink, shirt off, WATER RUNNING -- applying a

door, law books around a reading stand. Nico is in real
pain, exhausted, weakening --
321
LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Nico at Jackson's desk, its surface spread with the notes
and papers she got from Senator Harrison's aide's place. We
glimpse them: photos of Central American atrocities, dead
bodies, etc. He tries to study them, quickly, but his
attention shifts --
Nico glances around the apartment: more law books, Jackson's
degree on the wall, her rowing machine on the floor, several
framed photos beside him on her desk. Nico turns several
toward him.

Rosa has pulled back the curtain from the second-floor bed-

Nico's grim expression shows he knows just what this means.
BRANCA
Don't worry, they're booked on an early

Nico winces as the doctor finishes applying a bandage.
In
the background we hear a COMMOTION.

A bodyguard tries to fend off the physical and verbal assault
from Sara and Rosa. Sara carries Julian.

Sara rushes to Nico's side.
Nico reaches for her, but

Rosa starts forward, her face in agony at the sight of her
wounded son.
BRANCA
He's fine.
The boy has ribs of steel!
ROSA
(touching Nico's brow)
Enough of your humor.
Sara clings to Nico's arm, tears in her eyes. Rosa

crosses herself. Sara begins to weep. The doctor finishes.

There's a long awkward moment. Then:
BRANCA
(to doctor and
bodyguards)
Leave them. Leave them alone.
QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

Rosa sits in a chair. Nico on the couch, holding Julian.
Sara faces him. Tears have stained her cheeks, but she

Whatever Sara is proposing, Nico is dead set against it.

ROSA
Listen to her, Nicola.

Whatever you think of him, Federico
is family. He is our family.
Nico makes no response.
Instead, he lifts Julian, nuzzles
him tenderly.
NICO
Ever notice how clean babies smell?
Like nothing in the world has touched
them yet.
Sara glances to Rosa. Rosa knows what she wants. Dis-
creetly Rosa rises, exits. Sara and Nico are alone.
SARA
If you won't go to him, I will.
NICO
(in pain)
Don't push me like this --
Her eyes meet his -- loving, but desperate.
SARA
Branca can put us on a plane -- but
where can we fly to? Tibet? The moon?
There's nowhere they can't find us.
NICO
You don't know what the hell you're
talking about.
SARA
I'm talking about everything I've
learned from you in the past five
years.
Nico is in agony.
NICO
You know I can't go to him.
Sara takes both his hands in hers.
SARA
Do you know why I love you? Do
you know what it is about you
that I've always loved?
(as Nico fights his
own emotion)
Pride. It's what you have inside.
You don't live the way other people
live. You trust what you see as
right and won't let anyone or anything
make you stray from it.

The old man never looks directly at Nico, yet we sense keenly
that he is taking the younger man's measure.
FREDERICO LARUSSO
I am only an old man. An old man
with a cancer.
The two are like an old and a young lion, appraising each
other -- using all five senses and more.
NICO
I don't have much time, Uncle.
So
I must speak plainly.
Larusso listens.
Nico waits for a beat.
Then:

NICO
(this is very painful
for him)
-- For as long as I've been old enough
to think, I've hated you and hated
everything you stood for.
Larusso takes this in without a flicker.
NICO
I was so sure that you and I were on
opposite sides of the fence... and
that you and your people were
destroying this country --
Nico pauses, glances away across the grounds.
NICO
-- The most painful realization of my
life was that the people I worked for
and you are not far apart.
(meets Larusso's eyes)
-- And there's not much difference
between what you are and what I was.
Larusso studies Nico a long moment.
Then takes Nico's elbow. *

you would
ask... and I had every
intention
of refusing you.
He glances to Nico.
FREDERICO LARUSSO
But it is a form of wisdom to know
when to cease relying only upon
yourself.
He keeps walking.
FREDERICO LARUSSO
You know, of course, that this Senator
Harrison will never live to make his
speech tomorrow.

You know, too, that as long as this

Larusso stops, takes a small note pad from his pocket.
He
quickly scribbles a few lines.
FREDERICO LARUSSO
Memorize this address.
He holds the paper for Nico to see.
FREDERICO LARUSSO
Have you got it in your mind?
Nico nods.
Larusso tears the paper into tiny shreds.

349
The old man takes his leave of Nico with a warm, if formal
handshake. The guards stand by, waiting.
FREDERICO LARUSSO
Thank you, Mr. Carlucci. I trust you
will give my love to my niece, Rosa.
NICO
I will do that, Mr. Larusso.

hurry.

Still dodging appropriations

Keep your nose in the corner. When

ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT
Fox maintains a slight distance behind Nico as they cross to-
ward some escalators under a sign: "TO PARKING LEVEL 8."

he? He was gonna blow the lid off, so
you cleared Zagon to frost him --

Keep walking.

But the priest found out somehow and
ran here. You couldn't do the Senator's

Several guests and diners wait by the cashier's booth for
their cars to be fetched. Valets hustle with tickets. Fox
and Nico come off the escalator.
FOX
If your name was Joe Smith I never
would have caught it. But how many
Nicola Toscani's are there?
NICO
You got it off the arrest sheet.
Fox hands his ticket to the cashier, motions Nico to the
side, away from the guests, still keeping his distance --
should Nico try to make a move.
FOX
I tried to warn you, old buddy. I knew
you had wiretaps. and I knew you
wouldn't let 'em go.
NICO
Only I was too dumb to crack it. I was
so busy trying to figure a code, I
didn't even recognize Zagon's voice.
It's all crystal clear to Nico now.
NICO
So we kill our own senators now.
FOX
Why not?
The Romans did.
A Cadillac pulls up; the valet hops out, two particularly
florid, well-fed guests get in, tipping the valet.
NICO
(to Fox, watching the
guests)
Are we the Romans?
FOX
We're an empire too.
Fox doesn't like the look Nico gives him.

quote Lenin?

I'm trying to save you, asshole! I got

NICO
Fuck you.
FOX
In five years you're out, with a fat
Swiss account and a GS-15 pension.
Nico stares at his old friend with contempt. He sees the
gun under Fox's coat, but he's too tired and too disgusted
to care --
NICO
You know, Fox, right now in Israel
they're trying some 80-year-old camp
guard for war crimes. And all around
our country there are guys on Death
Row for killing one person, two people.
And probably they all deserve it --
He takes a step toward Fox.
Fox's hand tightens on his gun.
NICO
(emotion rising)
-- but you and I know a couple guys
personally who are responsible for the
murder of at least what... 60,000 non-
military personnel.
(ticks off the beats)
Viet. Lao. Thai. Cambodian.
Librarians, teachers, doctors... women,
children... and that's just a sliver of
it.
Fox tries to maintain a hard face.
But his own guilty
conscience is working --
NICO

We've wiped out entire fucking
countries. And not one agent --
FOX

view)
Stop right there!

You motherfuckers think you're above

Well, you ain't above mine.
Nico holds himself, trembling with intensity. At that
moment -- O.S. from the garage entrance ramp: the SQUEAL

Zagon and his men are forty feet from Nico and Fox, playing
it cool so as not to alarm any innocent bystanders, but the
bulk under their jackets is unmistakably guns.
NICO
Well... well.
What a team we have
here.
ZAGON
(calls, friendly)
We've been looking for you, Nelson.
I
see you've found our friend.
Fox looks shaky, unnerved: Nico's words have hit too close
to home. Now Nico backs away a step, ready for anything.
One of Zagon's agents holds their car's rear door open.
*
NICO
Thanks for the help, Fox.
FOX
I didn't bring him, Nico.
I swear it!
ZAGON
Have you two been sharing fond memories?
Reminiscing about the good old days?
Zagon waves Nico and Fox toward his car. Zagon and
*
Salvano start forward. Fox glances, torn, to Nico, who
has backed away another half-step. Will Nico attack?
Run for it?
100A.
FOX
Stay still!
(to Nico)
Don't fucking move!!
Fox pulls his .45 from concealment, covering Nico. An
EVENING-GOWNED WOMAN, waiting with her husband for their
car, hears Fox's shout, sees his gun.
101.
EVENING GOWN WOMAN
(grabs her husband's arm)
Jack --
The husband sees. So do the other guests. Salvano sees
their alarm; he swings his jacket open, revealing a snub
machine gun. Someone SCREAMS --
ZAGON
Bring in our friend, Nelson.
Salvano's muzzle covers Fox and Nico --
ZAGON
Be a good boy --
372
FOX
His moment of truth.
FOX
Dive, Nico!!
He FIRES -- at Salvano! In the same instant, Salvano pulls
his own trigger! Salvano's MACHINE GUN BURST cuts Fox down,
a milli-second before Fox's .45 SLUG BLOWS Salvano off his
feet! Pandemonium. Fox, dying, slings his .45 to Nico, who
snatches it from the ground just as a HAIL of MACHINE GUN
FIRE THUNDERS around him. Nico dives headlong behind a
concrete column, which is instantly chewed to shreds by
GUNFIRE. Zagon FIRES his MAC-10 on full automatic. A
second agent hurries forward to outflank Nico. Nico pops
from behind the column, DRILLS the agent broadside behind
the ear, blowing the whole side of his head off! Guests and
valets are shrieking in terror, hitting the deck in
clusters, clawing and scrambling over each other for safety.
ZAGON
(to first agent,
advancing)
Move!
Nico springs from cover, FIRING, trying to bolt down the
garage ramp, toward the lower levels. His path puts the
first agent directly in Zagon's line of fire. Zagon doesn't
hesitate; he OPENS UP on Nico, cutting down his own man --
Salvano has gotten to his feet, wounded, but still handling
his gun. He
joins Zagon, rushing forward --

Zagon turns to Nico.

How are you gonna do him, Zagon?

through a hotel kitchen?
The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and
choke. Zagon motions to slacken off. He stops at a
small table before Nico -- unrolls a well-worn felt pouch.
Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter-
rogator's trade come into view -- drug vials, syringes,
scalpels, surgical tools.
ZAGON
I've used these little beauties
many times to extract information --
(lifts a needle to
the light)
-- This'll be the first time I've
ever used them... just for fun.
Zagon sets the syringe down, slips on a heavy, weighted
glove.
ZAGON
(to agents)
Take his arms.
Pistol agent and Bad Dude move in, one on each side,
*
seizing Nico's forearms. Shotgun agent holds his weapon
tight to Nico's head.
106.
Zagon punches Nico square in the face, so hard the chair
reels backward, spinning out from under Nico --
ZAGON
Hold him up!
Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him
again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains
from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands
Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs
off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico
back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico
looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the
opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his
beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes
with defiance.
ZAGON
This is where you came in, Toscani.
Only, now it's where you're gonna
check out.
He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. Pistol agent
and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight. Zagon
injects Nico.
407
NICO
reacts instantly to the hypo -- cursing, sputtering under
the choking noose. He twists wildly trying to free him-
self, but the agents' powerful arms hold him.
ZAGON
That's it. Fight it, cherry.
Fight it, so it speeds faster on
its way --
Nico struggles more violently.
ZAGON
Fight it. Till the vessels burst
in your brain. Till the arteries
rupture in your heart --
Slowly, the struggle goes out of Nico. His muscles go
limp; he slumps -- drooling, babbling incoherently.
ZAGON
That's my boy. That's what I was
waiting for --
Zagon produces his famous knife. He motions Pistol agent
and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms. Noose agent slackens
his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer,
gloating, cooing --
107.
ZAGON
A fool learns from his own
mistakes. But a wise man learns
from the mistakes of others --
(moves closer, blade
in hand)
You should have killed me when
you had the chance, Toscani --
The blade moves to Nico's throat. Suddenly: Nico springs
to life (catching Noose man by surprise and jerking the
cable from his grip) -- grabbing Zagon with his taped
hands by the throat, lifting him bodily, slamming him
ferociously into the wall! Zagon drops to the floor,
half-conscious. Nico spins instantly to find: the Shot-
gun agent right behind him, raising his weapon to Nico's
face, about to pull the trigger. Nico sidesteps, grabbing
the man's wrist. The SHOTGUN GOES OFF, missing Nico by
inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall.
The Noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder
holster. Nico snaps the Shotgun agent's wrist, flipping
him through the air, simultaneously grabbing the weapon,
spinning behind the Noose agent, then using the shotgun
barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in!
Another swing wipes out Pistol agent. Bad Dude, now with
a clear shot, aims his M-16. Nico blows him away with a
double-barreled SHOTGUN BLAST. In a flash, Nico has spun
to Zagon's surgical tool table, lifted a rzor-sharp
scalpel and slashed the tape, freeing his hands. He
yanks the choke cable off his neck --
408
ZAGON - AGAINST WALL
On his feet again. He reaches swiftly to the floor,
snatches up his famous knife. Nico confronts him -- face
battered, bloody -- shaking, battling internal spasms.
ZAGON
Can you feel the chemicals,
cherry? You can't fight 'em much
longer --
NICO
Long enough to finish you.
Sweating, half-spitting, Zagon slashes at Nico like an
animal -- Nico traps the knife, and enters, smashes Zagon
in the face with one lightning blow. We see Zagon's nose
and face completely cave in. Nico comes under Zagon's
elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in
a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against
the joint -- which now starts to rip in half. Zagon is
screaming and cursing, writhing in agony -- The drugs
have hit Nico full force now. He's weakening, his eyes
are starting to roll. Zagon tries one last surge of
strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle
free when: the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken-
ing sound.

108.
As the joint hangs, dangling grotesquely, Nico reaches up
around Zagon's neck, still holding the dangling limb with
one arm. He begins to now do to Zagon's neck what he did
to his arm. We hear a terminal CRACK. Zagon's body
crumples to the floor. Nico, in delirium, staggers
toward the door --
409
A woman at a pay phone.
She turns, drops the receiver
in shock as --
410
NICO
bursts, delirious, from the stairwell door!

MAIN LOBBY - FRONT ENTRANCE
A commotion as Lukich, Agent Neeley and Jackson, arm in a

sling, race in from their car.

MAIN LOBBY - REAR - NICO
weaves wildly forward. He drops to his knees.
Guests
react in astonishment and horror.

JACKSON
is the first to spot Nico.
She runs up to him as he
collapses.
412B
NICO
looks at Jackson.

LUKICH AND NEELEY

reach Nico and Jackson.
LUKICH
(shouting for

Is there a hotel doctor?
Call 911!

NICO
passes out in Jackson's arms. Behind them we see a banner,
announcing Senator Harrison's address. From the ballroom we
hear CHEERS and APPLAUSE. A fiery address is being finished
inside. The senator is now leaving.
415
FULL SHOT - LOBBY
Total confusion. Guests staring everywhere. From a side
office, a man with a medical bag comes running. The senator
sees the group around Nico.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN ON:
416
Nico, propped up on the couch, looking like hell, but de-
finitely conscious and in full command of his faculties.
Sara, Jackson, and Rosa beside him.

TV
A network ANCHOR delivers the headline news.
ANCHOR (V.O.)
Earlier this week, the Harrison
Commission delivered its report
on the growing C.I.A. scandal to
Congress...
The image changes to SENATOR HARRISON behind a battery of
microphones, sitting at a senate hearing-type table, with a
plaque reading "SEN. ERNEST HARRISON" before him.
SENATOR HARRISON (V.O.)
(on TV)
-- officially-sanctioned deceit,
murder and corruption, will
continue until these men are
brought to justice.

NICO

looks up as the real Senator Harrison, Judge Alspaugh and
*
the others enter the room. TV SOUND DOWN. Harrison stops
before Nico, taking a moment to look with respect and ad-
miration at the man propped up on the pillows.

SENATOR HARRISON
Detective Toscani. I wanted to personally
thank you. You are making it possible for
a sliver of truth to finally come out.
He holds out his hand.
Nico takes it.
The senator gestures
to Judge Alspauch.
SENATOR HARRISON
And this is Clayton Alspaugh of the
fifth circuit court.
NICO
Your Honor.
The Judge nods to his stenographer, who swiftly sets up
her equipment, takes a seat. Rosa makes a face at Branca,
who rises, clearing a seat for the Judge. Sara moves
*
in tight beside Nico.
JUDGE ALSPAUGH
Are you sure you're feeling well
enough?
Nico glances to Sara, to the supporting faces around
*
him. Lukich. Neeley. Strozah. Jackson. The others.
*
NICO
(to Alspaugh)
If you're ready to listen, I'm
ready to talk.

CLOSE - STENOGRAPHER'S HANDS
As the Judge's VOICE begins OVER, "slating" the depo-
sitions, the stenographer's fingers start moving.
