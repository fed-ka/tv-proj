Theo drives his ratty old American car along a highway. The
car has Ohio plates. He sucks coffee from a 7-Eleven "Big-
Swig" cup and examines a map. A yellow plastic "Bowler on
Board" sign is stuck to a side window. Theo's music PLAYS.
His eyes nod off, then snap awake.

NIGHTMARE						4
The screen is black, except for three circles in the middle
of the screen. The light shining through them is snuffed out
by three large pink objects. There is a loud POP, like a
thumb being pulled out of a tight hole.
BOWLING BALL
A slow motion low tracking shot of a
bowling ball hitting a polished lane.
BOWLING PINS
Close-up of the milky white surface of
two bowling pins on opposite sides of the
lane - a seven-ten split. The RUMBLING
ball is heard in the distance like a
furious hulking steamroller of doom. The
pins begin to tremble, and then transform
into a Bridal Ken and Barbie. The dolls
burst into flame.
BALL
The ball blasts past the camera and
metamorphoses into Theo's car.
RAPID DISSOLVE TO:

A muzak cover of 'Broke, Busted, and Disgusted' PLAYS in the
background as Theo gingerly pulls a hot taco out of the
microwave oven. ALFIE, the rickety old man who runs the
store, shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping
it down. Theo pokes at the taco with a spork as steam rises.
He pulls a disgusted grimace. Alfie pours himself a cup of
coffee and then attempts to open a tiny container of half &
half. Because his hands are shaking so much, the cream goes
everywhere but into the coffee.
ALFIE
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day
without the stuff. Theo reaches over and
pours for him with a steady hand.
ALFIE
You're not from around here, are you?
THEO
I'm from Akron.
Alfie looks at Theo's bowling shoe attired feet.
ALFIE
You a bowler?
Theo's hand starts shaking uncontrollably. He puts down the
cream.
THEO
I'm looking for a man.
ALFIE
What kind of man?
THEO
A bowler.
Alfie presses a matchbook into Theo's hand and then trundles
off. Theo looks down at the matchbook; it reads "Bowl for
health, enjoy yourself. Babylon Lanes."

Theo walks into an empty run-down forty lane bowling alley
carrying his ball bag. It is dark. The fluorescent lights
switch on and the pin re-set machines whirr into action. SID
and BREEZE, two shady looking guys in a basement-sale suits
walk up lane dividers towards Theo.
SID
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
THEO
I'm not here to bowl.
SID
(gesturing to Theo's bag)
You drag that coconut around for your
health, or do you know how to use it?
THEO
(bristling at the challenge)
I'm looking for somebody.
BREEZE
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
SID
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
THEO
I'm looking for Buzz Fazeli.
Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
BREEZE
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
SID
What do you want with old man Faz?
THEO
Some unfinished business.
SID
If you wanna do business in this town,
there's other people around here got more
weight than old Faz.
A lady dwarf walks by.
DWARF
Evening Sid, evening Breeze.
SID
Evening Tina.
BREEZE
Good luck tonight Tina.
Tina opens a door and goes down some stairs.
THEO
You guys got something going on
downstairs?
SID
We provide some extracurricular
activities for the senior citizens in the
community.
THEO
Basement bingo?
Breeze sniggers into his hand
SID
(smirks)
Yeah, basement bingo.
BREEZE
Lemme see your ball.
Breeze grabs Theo's bag.
THEO
Let go of my bag.
Sid sidles around behind Theo who tries to keep him in sight.
BREEZE
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
SID
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Breeze unzips the bag and pulls the ball out. Theo's temper
is rising, he breathes deeply. He is obviously making a
Herculean effort to keep himself in check.
THEO
I said, let go of my bag.
With lightning speed Theo's hand shoots out and grabs the
middle fingers on Sid's right hand. Sid howls in agony.
SID
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
THEO
Tell your little pal to let go.
SID
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Breeze, astonished, drops Theo's ball into the bag. Sid
cringes in front of Theo.
THEO
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
BREEZE
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge,
past the Peter Pan, last house on the
dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid
drops to his knees and cradles his
damaged hand.
BREEZE
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
THEO
It belonged to my dad.
Theo turns and walks out.
10
Millie and Theo, with Zeus hot on his trail, enter the room.
BUZZ FAZELI, a sixty-five year-old man shaped a lot like a
compressed bowling pin, slouches in a recliner. The room is
decorated with trophies of Buzz's bygone pro-bowling halcyon
days.
MILLIE
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I
leave the door wide open. Let the parade
begin!
BUZZ
Clam it!
Millie is silent. Buzz gets up and approaches Zeus.
BUZZ
Hey, rat. C'mere.
Zeus growls at Buzz as he comes nearer, then clamps onto his
sleeve and hangs from his arm, growling ferociously. In one
smooth motion, Buzz flings the rabid poodle through an open
window and into the night.
MILLIE
Jerk.
She heads outside.
BUZZ
Sit down.
Theo sits on the edge of the couch. Buzz puts out his hand.
Theo shakes it.
BUZZ
Buzz Fazeli.
THEO
Theo.
BUZZ
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer.
You bowl on the tour.
THEO
I'm not on the tour this year.
BUZZ
(nods understandingly)
Need some advice, huh.
THEO
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress
says I'm a thorn in their side.
BUZZ
(dismissive wave)
Don't worry about the Congress, they're
just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
15
THEO
They suspended me.
BUZZ
Why'd they suspend you?
Theo's eyes glaze over, the lights in the room dim, and Buzz
seems to recede into the far distance.
17
TV SCREEN - FLASHBACK				17
In ultra-slow scan we see an image of two bowlers, one is
smiling cockily to off-screen fans and waving, the other is
Theo, his face filled with hate, winding up to smash the
other man in the head with his bowling ball.
THEO (VO)
It wasn't really my fault.
In the far background the hollow booming VOICE of a judge
delivers sentence.
JUDGE (VO)
The American Bowling Congress hereby
suspends Theo Maynard Skinner from all
professional bowling activities within
the jurisdiction of the American Bowling
Congress and its international co-
signers... The ball mashes into the
smirking mans head, causing it to snap
forward. The judge's gavel BANGS and the
crowd ROARS.
18
Theo snaps out of it, the room lights come up, and Buzz leans
in.
BUZZ
I got suspended when I was young, too. I
was pretty cocky in my day.
THEO
They suspended me for 100 years.
BUZZ
100 years!
(knits his brow)
THEO
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you
could help me Mr. Fazeli.
BUZZ
(uneasy)
What do you think I can do?
THEO
(sweating slightly)
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card
back. Where I come from, you're the king.
BUZZ
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy
could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't
do any good for me to talk to the
Congress.
(briskly changing subject)
Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
THEO
I've never had orange whips, I'm from
Akron.
CUT TO:
19
Millie and Buzz are in the kitchen, talking in loud whispers.
Millie fills a blender while Buzz cuts oranges.
MILLIE
He's the guy Buzz.
BUZZ
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the
whips.
MILLIE
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of
you, clippings, maps.
BUZZ
Bowlers don't go around killing other
bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll
give him some tips and an autograph and
he's outta here.
MILLIE
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz?
You're doing something dangerous in that
alley.
BUZZ
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
MILLIE
We should leave this town. I can't take
this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill
you in my house.
20
Buzz rejoins Theo in the living room.
THEO
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You
had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
BUZZ
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
THEO
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it.
The toughest shot on the last frame.
BUZZ
That game was before you was born.
THEO
My mom was there. She told me about it.
The 'Fazeli Split.'
21
The blender is wailing at high speed as Millie throws in a
whole box of laxative, a can of Drano and a jar of pills. Her
hands are trembling.
22
Millie walks into the living room with a silver tray holding
two orange whips; one thick and deadly, the other thin and
safe. There is laughter coming from both men.
BUZZ
And the irony is, thirty years later,
that prick is bowling in the seniors on
TV all over the world, and look at me. Ah
well. The docs made me stop, on account
of my ticker.
(taps his chest)
I don't really miss it, but then...
(chokes up)
...I miss it.
He spies Millie approaching with the tray.
BUZZ
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods.
Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so
that Buzz takes the untainted whip.
Theo
takes the other glass.
THEO
Thanks.
ZEUS
Zeus is on the sofa, GROWLING and tugging
at Theo's bowling bag. The bag rips apart
and the ball hits the floor.
ORANGE WHIP
Theo brings the drink to his lips. The
ball rolls across the room.
BUZZ
The ball rolls into Buzz's feet.
BUZZ
This your lucky bullet?
Buzz picks it up and reads the writing on the ball. He snaps
a look into the kitchen, seeing the empty Drano and laxative
cartons. Buzz slams the drink away from Theo's lips. The
drink explodes across the room. Buzz is up on his feet.
BUZZ
(with intensity)
Where'd you get this ball?
THEO
(stunned - looks at the mess on
the floor, then at Buzz)
It's mine.
BUZZ
Who gave it to you?
THEO
Grace Skinner.
BUZZ
(astonished)
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to
you?
THEO
She's my mom.
Theo stands and takes the ball from Buzz's hands. Buzz is in
shock, staring at Theo.
BUZZ
(regaining his voice)
Who are you? Who sent you here?
THEO
I'm your son. You're a hard father to
find.
MILLIE
Son?
BUZZ
(to Millie)
Millie, please.
(to Theo)
I don't have a son.
I think you better leave now young man.
Buzz gestures towards the front door.
THEO
(calmly)
Grace Skinner Fazeli, you must remember
her?
Buzz takes Theo by the elbow to eject him from the house.
BUZZ
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
THEO
(pulls his arm away)
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
MILLIE
Married?
Buzz grabs a large bowling trophy and waves it at Theo.
BUZZ
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you
are. You got no right to be here! Theo
yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
THEO
I got a right. You're my father.
BUZZ
I ain't nobody's father!
Theo hurls the trophy at Buzz. He ducks and the trophy sails
into a large glass trophy case. Broken glass and trophies fly
everywhere.
MILLIE
(noticing Zeus)
ZEUS!
Zeus is laid out cold near the spilled orange whip on the
living room floor. Millie hunches over her comatose poodle.
MILLIE
My poor baby!
BUZZ
(to Theo)
You see what you did?
(he picks up the ball)
Take your ball and get out.
Theo takes the ball and exits the house.
23
24
Theo stands at the self-serve island sipping coffee. A muzak
cover of 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' PLAYS.
THEO
(resignedly)
99 years, 241 days,
(looks at his watch)
15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling.
Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve
island and begins wiping it down.
ALFIE
Find your bowler?
THEO
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't
the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying
to affix the lid on his cup, but his
hands are trembling, spilling some of the
coffee.
ALFIE
My father used to say to me "Never..."
no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...
(puzzles)
Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
THEO
Maybe I should have left the ball in the
car.
25
A blender WHIRRS. Sheila, in her waitress uniform, carefully
chops something.
She watches an indoor motocross rally on the diner's color
TV. 12-PACK, a hefty construction worker, sits at the
counter.
12-PACK
Hey Sheila, how's that orange whip
comin'?
SHEILA
(mimicking him under her
breath)
How's that orange whip comin'?
THWAP! Sheila is dismembering a Ken doll with a big knife.
She scoops the parts into the blender and switches from pure
to frapp.
12-PACK
So, I heard Junior busted out again?
Sheila puts the glass down in front of 12-Pack with a THUNK.
12-PACK
Hey Sheila, you can whip my oranges
anytime. Sheila puts a Barbie head
earring on her left ear. Buzz comes into
the diner and slides into a booth. Sheila
walks over with a pot of coffee.
SHEILA
Cup of joe Mr. Fazeli?
BUZZ
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't
sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a
cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his
hands trembling.
SHEILA
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you
need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of
Theo pulling into the parking lot. She
puts a Ken head earring in her right ear.
Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
BUZZ
(groans)
Some people will do anything for an
autograph. Theo enters the diner and
walks over to Buzz.
THEO
Millie left to stay with her sister in
Ronkonkoma.
BUZZ
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like
you, you come out of nowhere and upset
things, scattering everything all over.
Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
THEO
What are you doing over at the lanes
that's so dangerous, Buzz?
BUZZ
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a
nervous old Nellie.
THEO
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
BUZZ
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to
kill me. Sheila comes over to take their
orders.
BUZZ
I'll have my usual please, Sheila.
SHEILA
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't
introduced me to your fan.
BUZZ
Sheila, meet...uh...
(leans in to Theo,
sardonically)
I forget the name.
THEO
(uncomfortably)
Theo.
BUZZ
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's
daughter.
SHEILA
(eyeing Theo up and down)
You look like you're something on the
lanes.
BUZZ
Theo's bowled on the tour.
SHEILA
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
THEO
What's your specialty?
SHEILA
Whips...orange whips.
THEO
Then I'll have the number four with one
of your finest whips.
SHEILA
How do you want it?
(their eyes meet)
The eggs.
THEO
(discomfited at the blatant
double entendre)
Uh...over easy.
SHEILA
Coming right up.
Sheila smiles and walks away. Theo watches her slink behind
the counter.
BUZZ
Watch out for that one. She's got a great
average, but she's looking for a prince.
And, believe me, she's
(more)
BUZZ
kissed a lotta tadpoles.
(looking Theo in the eye)
Listen, I been thinking about your
problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you.
It would be unethical. But, there is
something I could do for you.
(leans in, secretively)
Putt-putt golf.
THEO
Putt-putt golf?
Buzz pulls a golf ball from his pocket, flashes it and slips
it back.
BUZZ
It's the next level, the next
dimension...
(deep conviction)
...the small ball.
THEO
(in Buzz's spell)
The small ball.
BUZZ
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think
Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room
for real golf courses in Japan.
THEO
(snapping out of it)
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
BUZZ
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies
are my kind of people. Sheila steps over
to the booth with their food. The Buzz
Burger has three holes cut in the middle
to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz
sees the two sleazeballs park their car
and walk towards the diner.
THEO
(pondering the thought)
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
Buzz stands up abruptly.
BUZZ
I gotta wash up.
Buzz heads for the rest rooms. The door opens with a JINGLE.
SID
Three whips. To go.
BREEZE
When you get a chance.
Sid and Breeze walk over to Theo's booth and slide in. Sid's
middle fingers are taped to an aluminum splint. The BLENDER
kicks into action. Buzz watches the group from the bathroom
hall and tries to catch the conversation.
BREEZE
Hey, you still here?
SID
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
THEO
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
BREEZE
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's
favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the
plate. Buzz walks over to the booth
and
pulls his burger away from Sid.
BUZZ
Get away from that burger.
BREEZE
Sorry Faz, we didn't know you was here.
SID
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
BREEZE
(to Theo and Buzz)
Are you guys bruddas?
The booth party is silent for a moment. Theo LAUGHS.
BUZZ
No, we ain't brothers.
SID
You know why we call him Breeze?
Sid puts a hand near Breezes left ear and blows into Breeze's
right ear. He makes fluttering motions with his hand as if
wind was hitting it. Breeze's face breaks into a smile as he
pushes Sid away.
BREEZE
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm
serious! You guys are related, right?
THEO
He's my dad.
Buzz flashes a warning glare to Theo. Sid grabs some of
Buzz's french fries.
BUZZ
(slapping his hand)
Get your own.
BREEZE
See that, toldja Sid. I knew I seen a
resemblance.
BUZZ
Why don't you clowns get your whips and
get lost.
SID
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual
charismatic self today when he told us to
tell you...
(gazing artfully upwards and
rubbing his chin)
What was that he said...?
BREEZE
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't
like no sticky fingers in the till.
SID
(exasperated)
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
Sheila comes over and PLUNKS down the three whips-to-go.
BREEZE
(to Sheila)
Your pop said to put these on his tab.
Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards
the door.
SID
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is
waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and
steps between his father and the two
sleazeballs.
THEO
I'm coming with you.
Sid shies away from Theo, protecting his hand.
BUZZ
Easy. I got business to do, Theo. I'll
come back and haunt you later.
(drops a twenty on the table,
pats Theo's cheek)
Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Buzz goes outside with a sleazeball on either side. Sheila
takes the twenty dollar bill. Theo grabs his jacket and makes
for the door.
THEO
(to Sheila)
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
SHEILA
Mine, and they never tip.
The sleazeballs hustle Buzz into the front seat of their car
and patch out.
THEO
Do you know where they're taking him?
SHEILA
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there
for my dad. Everybody who has anything to
do with bowling in this town answers to
my dad. Theo splits.
27
28
MILES KASTLE lounges in a cheap chair behind Buzz's desk
toying with one of those motorized wire balancing sculptures
they have in airport souvenir concessions. He is a carefully
groomed middle-aged low-budget version of Hugh Hefner in an
acrylic sweatsuit with 'Miles 'O' Lanes' embroidered on the
front. Sid and Breeze push Buzz into the room. Buzz is poker
faced.
KASTLE
Buzz.
Buzz nods.
KASTLE
(to Breeze)
You got my whip?
Breeze pulls the third whip out of a bag and gives it to him.
KASTLE
(motions to Sid and Breeze)
Lose yourselves.
Sid and Breeze leave the room. Buzz goes to a locker and
begins changing into a flashy MC outfit.
BUZZ
What's on your mind, Miles?
KASTLE
We've been partners a long time now,
haven't we Buzz?
BUZZ
Seven years.
Kastle pokes a straw into the whip and takes a long drag.
KASTLE
This scam we got going here was your
(more)
KASTLE
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it
was a rotten idea, but I put up the
scratch.
(pulls a smile)
And now we got a beautiful thing.
BUZZ
It's a beautiful thing.
KASTLE
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz?
You know what we got? Buzz raises an
eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
MILES
We got balance.
Kastle flicks the little wire man. It bobs and sways.
KASTLE
A partnership is a very delicate balance.
But let's say something tips the scales,
maybe one partner takes more than his
share, then... Kastle tips the wire man
off his perch. The little motor squeals
pathetically.
KASTLE
... oops. We got no more balance.
Buzz looks on with narrowed eyes as he adjusts his cravat.
KASTLE
And look at that; both partners go down
together. Kastle shoves the sculpture
onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it
under his heel. He goes over and puts his
arm around Buzz.
KASTLE
Simple math, Buzz.
(he holds up his fingers)
Two plus two does not equal three.
BUZZ
Miles, I've always been on the square
with you.
KASTLE
I'm sure you have Buzz.
BUZZ
Wish me luck.
Buzz jogs out into a spotlight.
KASTLE
Break a leg...
(sneers)
...partner.
29
29
APPLAUSE erupts as Buzz appears in the spotlight. The dwarf
bowling alley is a pungently smoke-filled room peopled with
shady, washed-up bowlers sitting in chairs behind a bowling
lane. The old-timers are shouting and pounding shots.
BUZZ
(over the PA)
Greetings, ladies, gentlemen.
(the place grows silent)
My dentist told me this one the other
day: How many bowlers does it take to
screw in a lightbulb?
AUDIENCE
How many?
BUZZ
It takes three bowlers to screw in a
lightbulb. One to hold the bulb, one to
turn the ladder, and one to hold their
balls. Thank you, thank you. Just throw
money.
CUT TO:
30
31
Theo sneaks into an empty bathroom. He hears voices and ducks
into a stall. Sid and Breeze shove Buzz into the room.
SID
Seems to me like you ain't got much
choice Buzz.
Sid shoves Buzz over to Breeze, Breeze shoves him back.
BREEZE
You're between Miles Kastle and a hard
place.
BUZZ
Aaay, hands off the tux!
Sid checks under the stalls, sees Theo's feet and whips open
the door.
SID
The busyboy!
Sid yanks Theo out.
THEO
Get your hands off me, you moron.
Theo tries to free himself from Sid's grip. He turns to Buzz.
THEO
What the fuck is this?
BUZZ
What's it look like to you?
THEO
It looks like dwarf bowling.
SID
Very good, busyboy.
THEO
(with intensity)
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
SID
(sarcastically)
What are you gonna do, call the bowling
police?
BREEZE
Heh, heh, heh.
THEO
You said it would be unethical to help
me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
BUZZ
I do what I gotta do to survive.
THEO
You have no right to call yourself a
bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
BUZZ
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be.
I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking
anyone to bail me out.
THEO
I'm your blood.
BUZZ
You wish!
Theo pushes Buzz up against a stack of boxes full of new
bowling pins. Sid and Breeze hover behind them.
THEO
You knew she was pregnant.
Buzz reaches inside a box and pulls out a pin. He waves it
threateningly at Theo.
BUZZ
What makes you so sure it was me? She
coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes
Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men
struggle for the pin.
THEO
Don't say that about my mom!
BUZZ
I had a career. She wanted a little
bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap
into the fray, prying the two men apart.
They wrestle Theo against a wall,
pressing his face into the tiles.
THEO
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
BUZZ
That's a laugh. You're all strung out.
You're a bowling junkie.
THEO
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
BUZZ
You're dead without the pro-tour, and you
know it. Get him away from me. Sid and
Breeze punch Theo in the face.
DISSOLVE TO:
32
DWARF BOWLING ALLEY
32
Theo is dragged through the dwarf alley crowd. He has blood
on his face. Half dazed, he looks up at all the distorted
leering faces that peer down at him. The crowd cat-calls and
laughs at Theo.
33
Theo walks into an ultramodern eighty-lane bowling center,
bowling bag in hand.
A huge banner reads 'Mothers and Daughters Bowl Free
Tonight!' The entire place is filled with pairs of moms and
their daughters - bowling away in matching bowling attire. A
three year-old girl stands staring at Theo.
THEO
Hello.
LITTLE GIRL
Waaaaaaaaah!
A mom grabs the little girl and whisks her away. Theo surveys
the alley and catches sight of Sheila bowling at the far end
of the alley.
39
LANE, SHEILA & LUNA
39
Sheila bowls with LUNA, a 30-ish black guy dressed in a Miles
'O' Lanes jumpsuit and wearing extensions in his hair. Sheila
prods her friend when she sees Theo.
SHEILA
Luna, that's the guy. I saw him do this
spooky bowling rain dance on the bridge.
LUNA
Typical.
Theo walks over. Sheila presents Theo with her ball.
SHEILA
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a
seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane
and sees the two pins standing.
THEO
I'm not here to - I can't...
Sheila can't release the ball from Theo's now-paralytic grip.
SHEILA
(knowing nod)
Bowling block.
40
Kastle, Sid, and Breeze stare at a bank of video monitors,
their faces illuminated by the screens.
BREEZE
Think he'll bowl it?
KASTLE
Nah, he won't do it.
SID
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't
bowl.
KASTLE
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people
call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so
common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
BREEZE
What's this guy here for, anyway?
KASTLE
Maybe he's here to pay his last respects.
SID
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
KASTLE
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on
dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him
and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze
look sideways at each other.
KASTLE
I hired you rent-a-thugs to keep tabs on
the Faz. I want you all over him like a
tent. Find out how that little weasel's
ripping me off. Buzz Fazeli's gonna blow
the lid off dwarf bowling!

LANE, SHEILA & THEO
41
The two of them sit together behind the lanes.
THEO
I came here to have a word with your dad.
SHEILA
What do you want with my dad?
THEO
Business.
SHEILA
Won't your father help you with that?
THEO
(shakes his head)
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's
cracked up to be.
SHEILA
Your dad's one of the only nice people in
this fucking town. My Dad is slime.
Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and
shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
KASTLE
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting
you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't
come and see me sooner.
THEO
You know who I am?
KASTLE
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling
ball in this town without Miles Kastle
knowing about it. You don't mind if I
have a word with Theo, do you bunny?
Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls
him away.
KASTLE
I heard you've been having a little
trouble with the Congress.
(waves at a mother/daughter
couple)
Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle
walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
THEO
You might say I'm at the top of their
shit list.
KASTLE
Maybe I can help you.
(calling to a young bowler)
Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get
hurt with that big ball, honey.
(to Theo)
I've seen tapes of you bowling on the
circuit. You got Fazeli blood running
through you. Your pop was a genuine
talent in his day.
THEO
What's with the bad air between you two,
Mr. Kastle?
KASTLE
(dismissive gesture)
It's nothing, just a slight business
imbalance.
(to a seated mother)
How's Gloria's thumb?
MOTHER (OC)
The blister's worse than last week.
KASTLE
No pain, no gain! Keep trying the ice.
Chin up, sweetie.
(turning to Theo)
This place is a bowling oasis.
THEO
It's very...clean.
They pause and Kastle waves to some bowlers.
MRS. JACKSON (OC)
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
KASTLE
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite
'bowlerina' doing?
MRS. JACKSON (OC)
132, 154.
KASTLE
You keep that up Carmelita and one day
you'll be a champion just like Mr.
Skinner here. What do you think, Theo?
Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
THEO
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133
average. Her ball's flat, she needs to
work on her spin control.
KASTLE
That's right, didn't you have a slight
control problem in a recent
tournament,champ?
(to Carmelita)
Now go take out your "big four", darling.
(to Theo)
Come on, we're making her nervous.
They continue walking.
KASTLE
I get them while they're young. Builds
loyalty.
MRS. JACKSON (OC)
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
KASTLE
(waving over his shoulder)
Four or five years when a girl like
that's bowling on the pro tour for Team
Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on
my investment.
THEO
And the dwarf bowling?
They stop, and Kastle pulls Theo over to an enormous aquarium
near the lounge.
KASTLE
(making sweeping gesture)
Think of this business like a big
aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to
eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies
can swim free at the top.
(more)
KASTLE
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.
(looks at Theo)
Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
THEO
Nice set-up.
KASTLE
If it springs a leak, it'll be because
Buzz is making waves.
THEO
What if he wants to get out?
KASTLE
(chuckles)
He's earned an early retirement.
(sprays his mouth with Binaca)
But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is
history. Lets talk about your future.
(puts his arm around Theo)
I wanna show you something.
42
Kastle and Theo stand in front of the huge bank of video
screens.
KASTLE
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate,
Computerize. That, my boy, is the future.
One of the monitors shows a little girl
bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it
barely tips over the first pin. Kastle
hits a key and the pins explode in an
emphatic strike. The little girl jumps
with joy.
THEO
What ever happened to just bowling?
KASTLE
There's a lot of competition for
amusement out there. You gotta adapt to
survive.
THEO
I like the sport the way it is.
KASTLE
A guy like you could breathe some fire
into bowling. You got ambition like
a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what
you want and anything that gets in your
way - PSSSHHT! -
shish kebabs.
(puts his arm around Theo)
Maybe lady fate washed you up on my
doorstep for your own good.
(pauses for effect)
I think I could help you, Theo.
THEO
(he's been waiting for this)
How Mr. Kastle?
KASTLE
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I
could sponsor you.
THEO
Why would you help me?
KASTLE
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
Kastle turns to his video screens.
KASTLE
But, now that you mention it, you could
afford me one minor dispensation. Theo
follows his gaze to the screen.
KASTLE
While you're in town, I need you to keep
an eye on my daughter for a couple of
days. Her big brother broke out of the
mental hospital... Theo's eyes glaze
over, the lights in the office dim, and
Kastle seems to recede into the far
distance.
43
THEO'S POV - NIGHTMARE
43
As running FOOTSTEPS are heard, the camera whizzes down a
darkened alley towards the pins.
KASTLE (OS)
...and I want someone watching out for
Sheila while he's, uh, loose.
44
Theo snaps out of it, the room lights come up, and Kastle
points to her image on the TV screen. Sheila turns and looks
up at the video camera. Theo and Sheila's eyes seem to meet.
Theo freezes for a moment.
THEO
I could do that.
As the two men shake hands, Sheila "flips the bird" to the
camera.
KASTLE
One thing,
(pointing to Theo's mid-
section)
keep the meat in the freezer.
CUT TO:
46
Alone, Kastle stares at the bank of video monitors and runs a
battery powered fuzzball remover around his collar. The
monitors are deserted. Miles absently pans a camera over and
then sits bolt upright. On the screen he can see Buzz Fazeli,
in a room at Babylon Lanes, surrounded by large piles of
cash, stuffing rolls of bills into hollow bowling pins.
KASTLE
(with rising anger)
Why that filthy, slimey, double-crossing,
misbegotten, two-faced, mangy, son-of-a-
bitch bastard!
The motor in the fuzz ball remover SHRIEKS as Miles squeezes
it to death. It shatters in his hands.
49
Kastle hurries through the darkened bowling alley. He stops
short as a warning alarm begins to sound from somewhere deep
within the building. Lane six lights up and comes to life.
Kastle walks slowly forward.
KASTLE
Junior? Is that you, Junior? Don't be
afraid. Where are you? I won't hurt you.
Kastle stealthily sneaks along beside row upon row of silent
pin reset machines shining a flashlight in front of him.
KASTLE
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for
you, son. The beam of light catches
Junior's face. He is crouched inside the
machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut
and bleeding and his straitjacket torn
and filthy.
JUNIOR
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
KASTLE
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake
and shish-k-bob, just like you love.
Junior cringes away from the light.
JUNIOR
You made me hurt him!
Kastle reaches into his pocket and pulls a gaudy digital
wristwatch from his pocket.
KASTLE
Look what I got for you.
He holds the watch up in front of Junior. Junior looks
curiously at the watch.
KASTLE
Happy Birthday Junior!
The watch begins to play an electronic version of "Raindrops
Keep Falling On My Head." Junior's face lights up.
JUNIOR
Ooooooohhh.
Kastle begins luring Junior out of machine number six with
the watch.
KASTLE
I have someone for you to play with
Junior.
JUNIOR
Someone wants to play with me?
KASTLE
I have someone for you to play Blueface
with Junior.
JUNIOR
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.

Breeze drives. Sid gazes out the window. Enrico Caruso WAILS
from the car stereo.
SID
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All-
American. Breeze sings along with Caruso
and pretends to conduct.
BREEZE
La da da dalala...
SID
(looking heatedly disturbed)
I hate fuckin' opera.
BREEZE
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has
all the drama and excitement of real life
- to music!
SID
How do you know, you don't even speak
Latin?
BREEZE
You listen to the feelings, not the
words.
SID
You got an 8-track tape player on
purpose, just 'cause you knew the only
thing they had on 8-track was fuckin'
opera.
BREEZE
It was a clearance.
Sid seems to calm down.
SID
(wistfully)
You know, Elvis bowled.
BREEZE
No kiddin'.
SID
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport.
No megalomillionaires, no
(more)
SID
gambling. And it was a safe place for
kids, a place where the whole community
could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
BREEZE
(sympathetically)
Sure, Sid.
SID
(becoming rabid)
But not no more. Now people take
advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to
be. There's something evil spreading in
this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss-
ridden -
BREEZE
(getting excited)
- canker sore.
SID
(apoplectic)
Right, eating at the core, eating it's
way out. It makes me sick!
Sid starts pressing buttons on the tape deck
SID
How do you turn this thing off?
BREEZE
Wait! That's an aria!
Sid and Breeze struggle for the cassette. The music DISTORTS
into a warbling gurgle of an aria.
SID
Gimme that!
Sid yanks the cassette out, but the tape becomes tangled in
the player. He pulls at the endless yards of tape and throws
the whole mess out the window.
52
P.O.V. shot running desperately through the house, knocking
things over, smashing things. We HEAR Buzz screaming in
terror. The scream is cut off. With a THUD, the camera falls
over and hits the floor. The golf ball rolls slowly into
view, and stops. Footsteps recede, a door slams, and a car
drives away.
CUT TO:
62
Theo snakes his way along the rows of pin machines, towards
the only light source - lane six. As he leans in to peer
through the machine, a ball EXPLODES into the pins. Junior,
wearing his elaborate bowling claw, is working himself into a
sweaty froth. Junior picks up his ball and sends it CRASHING
into the pins.
THEO
Knock-knock.
JUNIOR
(stops and looks around)
Who's there?
Theo remains silent.
JUNIOR
(getting angry)
Who's there!
THEO
Buzz Fazeli.
JUNIOR
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's
there. I say who's there and then you say
who who. You're not playing right.
(primly)
Knock-knock.
THEO
Who's there?
Junior walks towards Theo.
JUNIOR
Junior.
Theo remains silent.
JUNIOR
JUNIOR!
(boiling)
You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm
going to have to hurt you. Theo and
Junior circle one another.
JUNIOR
You shouldn't touch her.
THEO
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
JUNIOR
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch
her. Sheila told me you played bouncy-
bouncy with her.
THEO
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz?
Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and
knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his
ankles.
JUNIOR
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I
like games.
THEO
(struggling to get away)
What did you do to Buzz?
JUNIOR
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so
I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.
(he grabs Theo's throat)
THEO
(hoarsely)
I don't want to play.
Theo stretches to get a nearby ball, but just can't reach it,
by millimeters.
JUNIOR
To play, I press my fingers on a throat
like this...
(he presses tighter on Theo's
windpipe)
...and then the mans face would go blue
and I should keep pressing...
(Theo's face goes pale blue)
...and I did and then he stopped moving
and he didn't play anymore after that.
Theo bends back a finger on Junior's
hand. Junior lets out a HOWL of pain and
releases Theo's neck. Theo GASPS for air.
JUNIOR
You didn't play fair.
(stands up)
You were almost blue.
Theo gets his fingers in a bowling ball and brings it up to
bash Junior in the head.
JUNIOR
Go ahead Theo, I saw you on TV. I'm your
biggest fan. Junior offers Theo his
unprotected head.
JUNIOR
(yelling)
Come on Theo, GIVE ME YOUR AUTOGRAPH!
Theo bashes Junior in the head with the ball. It bounces off
Junior's head like a Nerf ball and rolls down the alley.
JUNIOR
Thank you, Mr. Skinner! Thank you!
Theo desperately, but fruitlessly tries to get away. As he
crawls over the ball return trough, Junior puts his foot on
Theo's head.
JUNIOR
I can have her,you know.
(looks around and whispers)
She's not my real sister.
(he flashes a lecherous smile)
THEO'S POV A ball pops up at
the far end of the return and
TRUNDLES rapidly towards Theo.
The ball hits Theo's face with
a POW. BLACK OUT We HEAR
"Raindrops Keep Falling On My
Head." THEO'S BOWLING SHOE
ATTIRED FEET Being dragged
down the lane. Theo comes to
and looks down his body to see
the empty lane. He looks up to
see Junior pulling him towards
the pin reset machine. The cut
on Theo's forehead bleeds down
the side of his face.
JUNIOR
(muttering)
Lubrication.
MACHINE NUMBER 6
Junior pulls the dazed Theo into the pin-reset machine and
positions him under the pins. As Junior prepares the
machinery, a control cable on his claw becomes fouled. Junior
begins to thrash about as he tries to disentangle himself and
his malfunctioning arm. Theo rolls away as Junior's flailing
releases the machine. It comes slamming down on Junior just
as Theo slips out of harm's way. He gets up and staggers away
from the machine. Junior's HOWL echoes across the lanes. His
twitching feet protrude from the maw of the device. Lane six
goes dark. Theo limps up the lane.
CUT TO:
64
65
Theo grips the steering wheel with white knuckles. He nods
off at the wheel, the roadway through his eyes wavering and
distorting. He hits himself in the face in an effort to keep
himself awake.
66
66
The house is dark except for a light coming from the closed
bathroom door. Theo cautiously makes his way to the door.
THEO
(whispers)
Buzz? You alright?
WATER is running inside. Theo twists the doorknob and opens
the door with a jolt. Junior lunges out of the dark, mangled
and bloody with bowling pins sticking out of his chest.
JUNIOR
Don't you KNOCK?
Theo SLAMS the door shut.
67
Theo walks into the house. The place is completely trashed.
Theo picks up a golf ball from the floor. He makes his way to
the bathroom door and slowly turns the knob; then pulls back.
He picks up a nearby bowling ball and holds it over his head
as he reaches for the doorknob. This time, he thrusts the
door open. The bathroom is empty. Relieved, he cradles the
ball in his arms.
BALL
Thick crimson red fluid trickles down his
forearm, dripping off his elbow.
Horrified, he pulls his fingers out of
the ball. Blood streams out of the three
finger holes. He drops the ball to the
floor. He goes into the bathroom and
turns on the sink faucets.
Water runs as Theo manically washes the blood from his hands
and arms. He rinses the blood from the holes of his ball and
looks up to the mirror. "NOK NOK" is smeared in blood across
his reflection.
69
Theo nods off for a second and then snaps back. His eyes seem
hypnotized by the lines on the road which seem to swim and
undulate unnaturally. He nods again. And snaps again.
72
78
Theo standing in flowery long Bermuda shorts, matching
airbrush Luau shirt and 7-11 shades. The woman behind the
counter looks like Alfie's twin. (It's actually Alfie in
drag.) It's the same store as before, only with a tropical
motif. Instead of bowling magazines on the rack, there's Mini-
Golf Digest. ALFREDA examines the ball at arm's length,
through her bifocals.
ALFREDA
You a mini-golfer?
THEO
Nope.
ALFREDA
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new
putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to
leave.
ALFREDA
Can I get you something for the road?
THEO
You have orange whips?
ALFREDA
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
THEO
No. I'm from Akron.
79
81
Theo walks through the doors and into the alley packed with
serious bowling types. As he walks towards the back of the
alley, several bowlers stop bowling and stare at him in awe.
LUNA
Theo! Howya doin'?
Theo walks on. Others greet the conquering hero.
BOWLER
Theo! Hey, Theo's back!
TINA
Hello there, stranger.
LITTLE GIRL
(still crying)
Waaaaaaaaaaah!
At the far end, we see Sheila, dressed in a fitted jogging
suit, bowling alone on her lane. Bowlers stop and hold their
balls at their sides. Sheila notices the whole alley is
silent. Theo steps up to the lane, bowling ball bag in hand.
As he straps on his wristbrace he peers down the lane and
sees a seven-ten split; mule ears.
CUT TO:
82
BLACKNESS
82
A loud ZIP and light spills in through three holes. Three
fingers approach the holes, blocking out the light once more.
With a POP, the fingers leave the holes and the ball hits the
lane with a KLUNK.
LANE
The camera races towards the pins along the maple boards.
PINS
Two pins loom in the foreground, one at each edge of the
screen. The ball slams into the right hand pin in super slow
motion with a ROAR. Theo's eyes slowly close. The pin lifts
and hurtles slowly across the frame towards its unsuspecting
fellow pin. Theo's eyes open. With a reverberating EXPLOSION,
the pin is taken out.
83
83
Theo turns to Sheila and takes her in his arms.
SHEILA
Very professional.
THEO
I am a professional man.
SHEILA
(touches his lips)
Lips still for sale?
THEO
(nonchalantly)
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw
in the tongue.
SHEILA
(she pulls away, slightly)
Can you change something this big?
She pulls out a hundred dollar bill.
THEO
I don't know.
Sheila stuffs the bill down Theo's pants.
SHEILA
You'll owe me.
They smooch big time. One by one, balls drop to the lanes
again and pins start CRASHING.
