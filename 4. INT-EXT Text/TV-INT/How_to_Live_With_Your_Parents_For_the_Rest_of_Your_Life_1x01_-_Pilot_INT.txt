                    My stepfather, Max, is a successful 
                    nightclub owner with an aversion to 
                      traditional workout garb.

                    Max should buy sweats.  He looks 
                    like he s fleeing a crime scene.  How To Live                                              2.

                    I think it makes him exciting.

                                  POLLY (V.O.)
                    He s also the world s most resentful

      Max is in bed, his eyes closed.  Elaine and Polly stand near.  
      Max s eyes open.  He grabs Elaine s hand.

                                  MAX
                    Elaine, you let them take my ball.  
                    You were supposed to guard me, like 
                      a sentry...

                                  POLLY (V.O.)
                    Most people have a voice in their 
                    head that says,  look before you 
                    leap.   My mother s voice says, 
                     Look at me, I m leaping!  

      Elaine starts to peak under the blanket. 

                                  POLLY
                    Mom, stop, Mom, stop, Mom, stop...

      Elaine ignores her and gets a good look.  

                                  ELAINE
                    (TO MAX) I think you look better with 
                    just the one.  More distinctive.



      Polly makes Natalie dinner, Elaine munches off of what 
      Polly s making.  Natalie sits at the table.  She s been 
      playing dress-up and looks like Eva Gabor.  How To Live                                              3.


                                  ELAINE
                    (TO POLLY) Exciting news: Max s 
                    friend Kenny wants to ask you out.

                                  POLLY
                    Kenny is sixty.

                                  ELAINE
                    So?  Sixty is the new thirty.

                                  POLLY
                    Sixty is double thirty.

                                  ELAINE
                    I m not a mathematician.  I m a 
                    romantic.  And Kenny is a very 
                    tender lover.

                                  POLLY
                    Thanks. You just ruined Kenny.  

      Natalie crosses back. Polly gives her dinner.

                    Good job.  You totally got the

                    Does Kenny work here?  Is this an 
                    issue for HR?  

                                  POLLY
                    I gotta find somebody.  Who would 
                    know somebody?  Who in this office 
                    stays up past nine?

      Polly sees her assistant, JENN, 23, pull some underwear out 
      of her purse and put them on under her skirt while texting. 



      Max reads the paper. Elaine condenses her mustards.  Julian 
      enters, using his own key, kisses Elaine  hello. 

                                  JULIAN
                    Yo, do you have a brick?  

                                  ELAINE
                    A gold brick?  A brick of heroin? 
                     Brick  from  Cat on a Hot Tin 
                    Roof?   

                                  JULIAN
                    A  brick  brick to put it behind my 
                    wheel. I tore out my parking brake 
                      practicing donuts for when I have to 
                    do them in real life.  

                                  MAX
                    There s one by the tool shed.  

                                  JULIAN
                    Awesome. Thanks, Dad.  Just got a 
                    few more things to do so Polly can 
                    get her apps wirelessly.

                                  JULIAN
                    No.  Apps.

      Julian exits.  Max crosses to Elaine, urgently.

                                  MAX
                    (RE: JULIAN) He s making up words!  

                                  ELAINE
                    How inventive.

                                  MAX
                    He uses that phone installing crap 
                    as an excuse to be up here.  And 
                    now he has his own key?  He and 
                    Polly are divorced.  He should 
                    start a new family and invest in a 
                    tequila business like a normal 
                    person!

                                  ELAINE
                    Ooo, tequila. Good idea.

      She pours tequila as Max crosses and opens the fridge.

                    And he s stealing my cream soda.  
                    There s one less than yesterday.  
                    We need to keep an eye on him to 
                    catch him in the act.  Then, boom! 
                    I don't know what comes after the 
                    boom, but something good.

                                  ELAINE

      Polly is at Jenn s cubicle. Jenn is eating a cheeseburger.

                    Jenn, I know you think of me as

      Polly is inside a dressing room struggling to get a dress on. 
      Gregg and Jenn wait out side -- Gregg trying on hats and 
      looking at himself in the mirror, Jenn texting.

                                  POLLY
                    (CALLING OUT FROM DRESSING ROOM) 
                    Thanks for helping me find an 
                    outfit, you guys. I haven t dated 
                    since before Julian.  And a little 
                    bit while we were together but on a 
                    break.  And that wasn t really a 
                    date so much as a guy I picked up 
                    at a club who is now in prison.

                    God, everyone s having more fun 
                    than me, aren t they?

                                  JENN
                    And I wouldn t bring up the thing 
                    where you live with your parents. 
                    That s what made me lose respect 
                    for you.

                                  POLLY
                    Hmm, yes.  No way to make that 
                    sound sexy. Wow, this is really 
                      productive.  Jenn take notes.

                                  JENN
                    Okay.

      Jenn  writes  in the air.  POLLY ENTERS in the NEW OUTFIT.

                                  POLLY
                    So? Rockin  it or really rockin  
                    it?  (THEN) Please say really 
                    rockin  it... I m terrified.

      Elaine and Max are getting ready to go out.  Elaine does her 
      make up at her vanity table.  Max tries to decide which

                    Who s that?

                                  POLLY
                    My ex-husband, so maintain.

      Julian gets out of his car, as does Polly, trying to cover.

                                  POLLY (CONT D)
                    Hey, hi! That GPS thingy on the 
                    phone? Genius. You did good, you.

                                  JULIAN
                    You look hot.  

                                  POLLY
                    Not really, this is fake leather 
                    that just looks expensive. I was at 
                    a boring work party.

      As Luke opens the car door and spills out on the ground:

                                  LUKE

                      (MAINTAINING HER DIGNITY, TO 
                    JULIAN) So why are you here?

      Julian knows what s going on but chooses to ignore it.

                                  JULIAN
                    Natalie called me... something 
                    about a dog?

                                  POLLY
                    Max s damn dog sculpture!  That s 
                    it!  I m taking the other ball!

      Polly, pissed, crosses to the front door, followed by Julian 
      and a staggering Luke.



      They enter.  As Natalie runs to Julian, climbs on his 
      shoulders:

                                    NATALIE
                    (TO JULIAN) Look, mommy has a 
                      boyfriend.

                                  POLLY
                    (TO ELAINE AND MAX) Who told her 
                    about the date?

                      ELAINEMAX
      I have no idea.She did.

                                  ELAINE

                    Who can say who said what? (TO 
                    LUKE) I m Elaine, by the way.

      Max shakes Luke s hand.

                                  MAX
                    Max.  Nice touch with the flowers.  
                    (URGENT) Julian, what the hell are 
                    you doing on Polly s date?

                                  POLLY
                    (TO ELAINE AND MAX) All you had to 
                    do was watch her for, what?  Five 
                    hours?  Six?  You couldn t just put 
                    the dog sculpture away.  Why do you 
                    insist on confronting people with 
                    things they re afraid of?

                                  POLLY
                    What? Yes you are.

                                    NATALIE
                    No, I m not.  Look!

      Natalie opens the door. A PUPPY comes racing towards Polly.

                                  POLLY
                      Aaaaahhhh!!!!!

      Polly runs into a closet.  The puppy BARKS.  Max, Elaine, 
      Natalie and Julian gather round as Polly castigates them from 
      INSIDE THE CLOSET.  Luke lays down on the floor.

                                  ELAINE
                    I know what s going on here.

                                  POLLY
                    (FROM CLOSET) That must be a nice 
                    change of pace for you.

                                  ELAINE
                    You re projecting your fear of dogs 
                    onto Natalie.

                                  POLLY
                    (FROM CLOSET) Gee, I wonder why I 
                    have that.

                                                                            POP TO:

      They are as they were.  Polly s still IN THE CLOSET.

                                  ELAINE
                    I don t see how it s my fault that 
                    that dog turned out to have

      Polly bumps into a shelf causing a bunch of HATS to fall on 
      her.  Just then, Natalie looks out the window.

                                  MAX
                    Maybe.  But it s totally irresponsible

                                  JULIAN
                    I think tonight proves it s way

      Luke obliges.  Max and Julian share a  Really, dude?  look.



      Polly drives.  Elaine sits in the passenger's seat; Natalie's 
      in the back, in a car seat, distracted with the new puppy.  

                                  ELAINE

                    I can t believe you told Natalie I 
                    was getting a boyfriend.

                                  ELAINE
                    I didn t.  I said if she did, it

                    accent in her life, like oregano in

                    there s no such thing as oregano 
                    sauce.  Because it s crazy.  

                                  ELAINE
                    I m not an accent.  I m an entree.

                                  POLLY
                    You need to pull it back, you. You 
                    need to act like other people are 
                    watching. 

                                  ELAINE
                    I want them to watch.  Everybody 
                    knows that about me.  (THEN) What 
                    is this really about?

                                  POLLY
                    I m scared Natalie will turn out 
                    like me, okay?  I m a divorced 
                    woman, living with her parents, who 
                    sells popcorn.  There are so many 
                    choices I make every day that could 
                    screw Natalie up, and I won t know 
                    which one was bad until she s grown 
                    up and mad at me.  

                                  ELAINE
                    Not even then.  Look, you are 
                      fantastic.  You re a great mother, 
                    you re very thin... you re the best 
                    thing I ever did, and I once had 
                    sex with a Chicago Bull.  I won t 
                    say which one, because I... 
                    don t... remember.

      Polly reaches over and squeezes her mother s leg.  In the 
      rear view mirror, Polly sees Natalie hug the puppy.  

                                  POLLY
                    I swear she said she was afraid of 
                    dogs... now she s just making me 
                    look bad...



      Max looks at himself in the mirror, naked from the waist up, 
      wrapped in a towel.

                                  POLLY (V.O.)
                    I d like to thank my stepfather, 
                    Max. I wasn t happy when he showed 
                    up, but I m happy he stayed.

      Max takes off the towel, looks at himself naked (BLURRED).   
      Elaine comes up behind him.  He shrugs a la,  what're you 
      gonna do?   They kiss.



      Polly looks in on Natalie, asleep in her bed with the puppy.

                                  POLLY (V.O.)
                    I d like to thank my daughter for 
                    making me be brave.  She better
