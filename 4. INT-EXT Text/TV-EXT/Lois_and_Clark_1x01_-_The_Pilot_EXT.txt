		Without stopping to think things through, Clark uses his

		Clark makes it look like the impetus of the blast is enough
		to send them flying, but in fact he is flying them. They
		land several hundred feet from the hangar, in a large
		puddle of mud.



		Lois and Jimmy slowly open their eyes.  Lois looks back at
		the hangar, reduced to rubble.  Scientists and staff from
		the adjacent hangars are running from the buildings.

			What happened?

					CLARK
			I'm not sure... I guess the force

			Look!

		Up in the sky, Baines' helicopter.  A beat, then the

		We are now in line with the colonists.  One in particular
		gets our attention.  It's Lois, dressed in a colonist
		outfit and apparently about to successfully stow away.
		When Lois reaches the entrance, she walks inside the
		capsule.



		Hundreds of spectators watch and wait to see if the
		transport will be taking off.  Suddenly, they see
		something else -- our hero, in full costume, flying across
		the field to the launch pad.

		A bunch of good old boys in a flat bed truck are polishing
		off their third six pack.  They stare up at the flying

			What the hell is that?

					SECOND MAN
			Is it a bird?

			Nope.  It's just a guy in a pair of
