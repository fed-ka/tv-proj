    MRS KING, MR FLATLEY

    MRS KING S face wears an expression of horror as she stares 
    at messy piles of different colouredfolders spread out on 
    the desk before her. 

                                  MRS KING
                    Mr Flatley, I asked to see the 
                    school records two months ago! 
                    Why have you filled the room with 
                    waste paper?

    MR FLATLEY seems unphasedby her sarcasm.

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    This isn t waste paper! It s our 
                    filing system. Invented it myself 
                    actually. It s rather brilliant. 
                    Even if I do say so myself.

                                  MRS KING
                    But this is chaos!  

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    No no. It s all perfectly 
                    logical.

    MR FLATLEY tidies the files into neat lines.

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    Each child has a nickname to help 
                    me remember who they are. And 
                    each file is arranged 
                      alphabetically according to these 
                    nicknames.

    MRS KING narrows her eyes as MR FLATLEY continues 
      excitedly.

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    For example...

    He picks up a yellow file marked with a  C .

                                  MR FLATLEY
                      RobbieSmall is under C for Cake.

                                  MRS KING
                    Why cake?

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    Easy... Small plays for the 
                    football team... footballersget 
                    yellow cards... yellow cards 
                    aren t as nice as birthday 
                    cards... and if it s your 
                    birthday you ll want some cake.    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 3.


    MRS KING S jaw has dropped open. She begins rapidly 
      examining the files laid out before her.

                                  MRS KING
                    The whole school administrative 
                    system is based on this?

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    Well, I ve simplified things for 
                    you of course. The childrens 
                    files are also colourcoded 
                    according to the number of 
                    letters in their surnames. 

    MRS KING shakes her head angrily.

                                  MRS KING
                    Little wonder the school s in 
                    such a mess. It ll take a genius 
                    to sort this lot out! What class 
                    is Rose Guptain at the moment?

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    Oh... I gave her the morning off. 
                    Some very important thingymebob
                    she had to do.

    MRS KING rolls her eyes. 

                                  MRS KING
                      Unbelievable. 

    She leaves, slamming the door behind her. MR FLATLEY rather 
      obsessively rearranges a pink file in the correct row.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      OSCAR, ROSE, CARRIE, FRANK, CHIEF AGENT SHAW, AGENT LILL, 
      AGENT KHAN, N/SMI9 AGENTS

      OSCAR, ROSE and CARRIE are attending an urgently convened 
    MI9 seminar in an atmospheric film-noir smoke-filled room. 
      FRANK is also in attendance. They re at the bottom end of 
    the table that has clearly been set out in some order of 
      hierarchy. CHIEF AGENT SHAW stands by a flip-chart at the 
      head of the table, flanked by AGENTS KHAN and LILL. A 
      Projector shows first  MI9  then  OPERATION SWEET TOOTH .

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    My operation had been planned to 
                      perfection. A tip-off seems the 
                    only explanation for our failure.  

      AGENTS KHAN and LILL nod. ROSE leans across to OSCAR.    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 4.


                                  ROSE
                    I can t see a thing through all 
                    this smoke. 

                                  OSCAR
                    I think the air con s broken. 
                    Can t you sort it, Frank?

                                  FRANK
                    I m here in my capacity as a 
                    senior MI9 agent - not as a 
                    caretaker!

                                  CARRIE
                    Yeah, but I bet you d have it 
                    fixed in no time.

      FRANK raises an eyebrow, gets out his screwdriver and then 
      ducks under the table.

                                  FRANK
                          (as he works)
                    I did once install a whole air 
                    conditioning system for a shanty 
                    town in Latin America.

    The smoke slowly clears. CHIEF AGENT SHAW is still talking.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    ... his weakness for pastries is 
                    the last lead we have on the 
                    Grand Master... 

      CHIEF AGENT SHAW turns the flipchart.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    What we need now is newideas. 
                    Out of the box thinking...

    He writes  1  on the paper and turns expectantly to the 
      table. CARRIE S hand goes up. He chooses not to see it. 
      There are no other hands raised. 

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Agent Lill?

      AGENT LILL - not inspired - tries to think.

                                  AGENT LILL
                    Er, we could... Uh, introduce ID 
                    cards and maybe he d fill one in?

      CHIEF AGENT SHAW writes on the chart.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    ID cards... good...    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 5.


      OSCAR and ROSE roll their eyes. CARRIE S hand is still 
      raised. AGENT KHAN whispers to AGENT LILL who raises her 
      hand again. CHIEF AGENT SHAW nods.

                                  AGENT LILL
                    Offshore savings accounts, sir. 
                    We look to see if the Grand 
                    Master has any in his name?

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Good, good, I like it...

      OSCAR whispers to ROSE.

                                  OSCAR
                    Bank accounts? Get more obvious!

      CARRIE S hand is still raised.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Anyone else?

    He chooses not to see CARRIE.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Agent Khan?

    But before AGENT KHAN can speak, CARRIE is on her feet.

                                  CARRIE
                    I ve got an idea sir.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Ah, yes... we must give youth a 
                    chance. (BEAT) I suppose. 

    He puts the top back on his pen. 

                                  CARRIE
                    I ve been looking at the data and 
                    I think we ve missed a trick.

      AGENTS LILL and KHAN exchange a complacent smirk.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Go on...

                                  CARRIE
                    It s the rabbit. We all know The 
                    Grand Master has a rabbit, right? 
                    General Flopsy...

      OSCAR and ROSE exchange a look. Where s she going with 
      this?    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 6.


                                  CARRIE
                    And it goes everywhere he goes. 
                    So maybe we could sort of catch 
                    the Grand Master if we can get to 
                    General Flopsy?

      There s silence in the room. CARRIE sits down. AGENT LILL 
      laughs, followed by AGENT KHAN and then all the other 
      AGENTS except for our team and CHIEF AGENT SHAW who doesn t 
      look at all amused. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

                                  CARRIE
                    I still say it was a good idea. 
                    Their pets mean a lot to people - 
                    even someone like the Grand

                                  ROSE
                    I agree. Maybe something 
                    unexpected is just what s needed?

      OSCAR looks witheringly at CARRIE and ROSE. He takes a 
      magazine out of his bag. ROSE looks up to see MRS KING 
      standing over her.

                                  MRS KING

      ROSE and MRS KING are sorting through MR FLATLEY S files. 
      ROSE has taken a letter from a red file.

                    You ve been a great help.

      Closing the door, MRS KING turns and rushes back to the

                    specially trained squirrels and 
                    rabbits that won the Cold War.

                                  CARRIE
                    It was?

                                  HUTCHINSON
                      Absolutely. The squirrels stole 
                    microchips and hid them in trees.

      OSCAR, AVRIL, N/SKIDS

    The bell has just gone and the class begin to leave for 
      their next lesson. OSCAR lounges at the back of the class, 
      reading Krazy Cars Weekly. AVRIL sits next to OSCAR. 

                                  AVRIL
                    You do know cars are choking the 
                    earth? Have you got no interest 
                    in your carbon footprint?

      OSCAR looks at his shoe.

                                  OSCAR
                    What footprint? 

                                  AVRIL
                    The effect you re having on the 
                    world. Cars are destroying it.

                                  AVRIL
                    That s just as bad. How long have 
                    you been reading this dumb mag?

      OSCAR shrugs.

                                  AVRIL
                    Let s say five years, times fifty 
                    two... that s like two hundred

                                  OSCAR
                    Huh?

      AVRIL sighs impatiently.    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 10.


                                  AVRIL
                    You just don t care about saving 
                    the planet at all do you?

    For a moment she almost gets under OSCAR S skin. He reacts.

                                  OSCAR
                    You haven t got a clue what I do.

                    Come on then... what do you do 
                    that s so great?

      OSCAR suddenly realises he can t say anything.

                                  OSCAR
                    Nothing. 

      AVRIL walks away, enjoying her moment of triumph. OSCAR 
      shakes his head. Suddenly his attention is caught by 
      something in the magazine. He grabs it and reads it closer. 
    We see his POV a full page ad for a new sports car -  The 
        HefirelloOsburn-car .OSCAR takes his pen and blocks out 
    the middle 4 letters of the two words - 

                                  OSCAR
                    Hello Oscar!

    We now see it reads  Hello Oscar!  OSCAR looks shocked. He 
      looks around to see no-one else is looking, then examines 
    the other words in the picture. We see him blocking out 
      more letters in words within the text and pictures (on 
      number plates etc). 

                                  OSCAR
                    Must meet. DeightonLake...

    We see the whole message now revealed:  Hello Oscar. Must 
      meet. DeightonLake. Thursday 12th. 1pm.Tell no one. Mum. 

                                  OSCAR
                    Mum? 

    He looks at a calendar wall chart - it shows today as the 
      12th. OSCAR s communicator flashes. He answers it.

      OSCAR stares moodily into the distance wondering what to 
    do. He picks up the magazine and leaves the classroom.

      NEWS PRESENTER, MAURICE HUTCHINSON

      A REAL NEWS PRESENTER interviews MAURICE HUTCHINSON.

                    With me is Maurice Hutchinson of 
                    P.R.A.T- the Pet Registration

                    is this new illness that rabbit 
                    owners should be worried about?  

      MAURICE S nose twitches. 

                                  HUTCHINSON
                    Well firstly it s only WHITE 
                    rabbits that are affected. The 
                    illness is called  Blue Ear 
                    Disease .

                                  NEWS PRESENTER
                    And what symptoms should worried 
                    owners be looking for?

                                  HUTCHINSON
                    In the initial stages, twitching 
                    of the nose.

                    And if your white rabbit has a 
                    twitching nose, what should you 
                    do?

      MAURICE wipes his nose like a rabbit using its paw.

                                  HUTCHINSON
                    You must bring it in to an 
                    official P.R.A.Tvet where we can 
                    test for Blue Ear, and if

                    Nice work, Carrie. All rabbits 
                    have twitching noses so 
                      identifying that as the main

                    Each P.R.A.TVet will take a DNA 
                    sample for us to check against

                    when we had him confined during 
                    the U.SPresident mission.

                                  CARRIE
                    Once we get a match between the 
                    two samples we ll know that 
                    rabbit must be Flopsy.

      SCENE OMITTED1515


      OSCAR

      OSCAR skulks along the corridor. He sees a small anonymous 
      locker room which OSCAR slips in and turns on the light. 
      There are three or four lockers but OSCAR knows which one 
      he s looking for. He takes out the  Magno-Thumb and uses 
    it to pick the lock. The locker opens and OSCAR begins 
      rifling through the various items inside. OSCAR finds what 
      he s looking for...    He takes out and examines a large 
      tube of ointment, reading the small print to himself.

                                  OSCAR
                     Rare tropical diseases ...

    He sees something else in the locker. He reaches in and 
      pulls out a small locket. He looks at the locket. Moved. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

                          (Lovingly)
                    Oh, Oscar, how do you always 
                    manage to get in such a mess. 

                                                                          CUT TO:


      OSCAR, CHIEF AGENT SHAW

      OSCAR is looking at the locket in his hand. A tear in his 
      eye. The door opens, CHIEF AGENT SHAW enters. OSCAR palms 
    the locket and wipes the tear away.     MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 18.


                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    The creche is on the 2nd floor. 
                    Oh I forgot you re an  agent  
                    aren t you.

      OSCAR holds up the tube of cream.

                                  OSCAR
                    Yeah. Uh just cleaning out this 
                    locker. Agent re-assigned.

      CHIEF AGENT SHAW seems satisfied.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Wonderful, they found a dangerous 
                    mission to suit your abilities. 

      OSCAR smiles, trying to hide the anger within. CHIEF AGENT 
      SHAW takes something from a locker and leaves and OSCAR 
      looks at the tube again, suspicious. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

                    Can we talk?

      FRANK puts down his gadget.

                    Sure.

      OSCAR looks across at ROSE and CARRIE at their computers.

      OSCAR, FRANK

      OSCAR has almost finished his story, he is showing FRANK 
    the tube of cream.

                                  FRANK
                    Thanks for being so honest with 
                    me. Let s take a closer look at 
                    this medication you found in the 
                    locker. SKUL may have tampered 
                    with it in some way. 

      FRANK puts the cream under a microscope. 

                                  FRANK
                    Mmm... looks like a simple anti-
                    inflammatory with a methylparaben 
                    coating.

    He takes the top off and squeezes it onto a glass plate. 
      FRANK and OSCAR watch in astonishment as the cream forms 
      itself into words (morph style). It spells out names and

                    If they got this info out of mum 
                    she must be in a really bad way.

                    turn this situation to our 
                    advantage?

      OSCAR picks up the tube of cream.

                                  OSCAR
                    Yeah... what about if we gave

                    I knew it... He s been off his 
                    greens all week. You have to let 
                    me stay for the operation.

                                  ROSE
                    Out of the question.

                                  THE GRAND MASTER
                    But he needs me!

    The GRAND MASTER holds up his handcuffs.

                                  THE GRAND MASTER
                    You ve already won. You owe me 
                    this much at least.

                                  ROSE
                    OK, but one wrong move and you re 
                    out of here.

                    I ve prepared the operating

      ROSE, CARRIE, GRAND MASTER, HUTCHINSON, FLOPSY

    The sound of a beeping heart-monitor leads us into the 
      operating theatre, past an electronic pulse read-out to where 
      FLOPSY is on the operating table. CARRIE, ROSE, and The 
      GRANDMASTER are all in attendance. They all wear surgical 
      masks. The GRAND MASTER is handcuffed. MAURICE HUTCHINSON is 
      performing the simple operation. He pauses for a moment, 
      sweating profusely. ROSE dabs his brow. 

                                  HUTCHINSON
                    Almost there. Swab...

      CARRIE hands him a swab in a kidney-dish.

    We notice the GRAND MASTER palm a small hooked instrument.

                                                                          CUT TO:

    The heart monitor beeps steadily. HUTCHINSON begins taking 
    off his rubber gloves while ROSE dabs him down.

                                  THE GRAND MASTER
                    Is that it? How is he?

                                  HUTCHINSON
                    Fine.

                                  THE GRAND MASTER
                    He always was a fighter.

                                  HUTCHINSON
                    We won t be able to move him for 
                    a while though.

    The GRAND MASTER leans tearfully over to FLOPSY.  

                                  THE GRAND MASTER
                    Goodbye, General. I ll see you in 
                    a few days.

                                  ROSE
                    I m sorry, but I don t think they 
                    allow rabbits in prison.

                                  THE GRAND MASTER
                    Prison? Whatever makes you think 
                    I m going to prison?

    His hands free, he hits a switch and the lights go out. 
      It s black. We hear a door bang.

                                  CARRIE (O.S.)
                    He s getting away!

      A BEAT, then the lights come back on. CARRIE tugs at the 
      door, now locked. The cuffs are dangling from the door knob

                                  ROSE
                    I ll call Oscar!

      ROSE takes out her communicator. Just then, we hear the door 
      unlock. It opens.

                    Heard you ve got The Grand 
                    Master. Nice work! Where is he?

      CARRIE and ROSE exchange an uncomfortable look.

                                                                          CUT TO:    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 28.

      CARRIE and ROSE look glum.

                    Don t take what Chief Agent Shaw 
                    said to heart, he s just jealous 
                    because you came closer to 
                    catching the Grand Master than he 
                    did. 

      OSCAR looks even more depressed, he is looking mournfully 
    at the locket in his hand.

                                  OSCAR
                    I blew my one link to my mum. 
                    Plus I ve probably made things 
                    worse by trying to trick SKUL.

                                  CARRIE
                    There s still someone who can get 
                    us out of this mess.

      CARRIE crosses to GENERAL FLOPSY, in a cage by HUTCHINSON, 
    who checks his pulse with a stethoscope. The others look 
      puzzled.

                                  CARRIE

                    Carrie s right, we saw how much 
                    The Grand Master loves Flopsy.

                    recovered so well. Good luck with 
                    the rescue mission.

      CARRIE heads off and HUTCHINSON heads for the door. He s 
      about to exit when another hand grabs his own. He looks up 
    to see --- MRS KING.

                                  MRS KING
                    I know why you re here.

      HUTCHINSON twitches like a nervous rabbit.
