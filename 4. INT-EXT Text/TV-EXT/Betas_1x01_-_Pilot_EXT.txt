        A hip-hop themedTaco Truck ( Tacos, Nah mean! ) is parked at 
      the curb in front of the bar. Drunken TECHIESwolf burritos 
      and smoke e-cigarettes. Trey stands by the window, talking to 
      the thuggish PROPRIETOR of the truck, while--

        Mitchell and Hobbes sit on the sidewalk, eating tacos and 
        drinking sodas. Hobbes spots Mikki and Dane standing in line.

                                    HOBBES
                      Look sharp. Your future ex is here.

                                    MITCHELL
                        What reyou-- Oh God. No, wait--

      But Hobbes is already making his way over to Mikki and Dane. 
        Mitchell reluctantly follows.

                                    HOBBES
                          (to Dane)
                      What s crackin , Chin Curtains?

                                    DANE
                      I was just telling Mikki that I m 
                      spinning at The Cellar on Friday. 
                      You guys should come check out my 
                      set.

                                    HOBBES
                      Yeah, I will neverbe drunk enough 
                      for that. Mikki. A pleasure. I m 
                      Hobbes. And this-- is Mitchell. Boy 
                      genius and turntable prodigy.

                                    MITCHELL
                      Hi, hey, hello. It s nice to uh, 
                      finally... I ve been watching you 
                      across the office for like, weeks. 
                      I mean, not-- notin a creepy way.

        Cringe. Mikki offers a half-smirk in response.

                                    DANE
                      What kind of stuff do you spin?

                                    MITCHELL
                      Oh... all... kinds of stuff.
                            (Dane waits, curious)
                      You know, mad crazy beats, like--
                                    (MORE)    1/28/201315.

                                      MITCHELL(CONT'D)
                            (beat-boxing)
                      And the--
                            (scary dubstepnoises)

        A bizarre performance. But before Mitchell can dig himself 
        deeper, Hobbes  trips  and SPILLS his drink on Dane s shirt.

                                    HOBBES
                      Oh, shit! Sorry, man. We better get 
                      you to a sink.

                                    DANE
                      Careful! This shirt s hand-painted.

        Hobbes leads Dane away, shooting Mitchell a look--  Make your 
        move!  Mikki stares at him, bemused. When she finally speaks, 
      her tone is completely deadpan. This is just how she rolls.

                                    MIKKI
                      Nice beat-boxing. Are you 
                      classically trained?

                                    MITCHELL
                      Ha!  Classically trained.  LOL. 
                      Totally. That s-- wow.

        Another awkward beat.

                                    MIKKI
                    Do I make you nervous, Mitchell?



        Smooth rock plays as Trey drives. In the passenger seat, Nash 
        SCRATCHES at the woefully unfashionable JEANS he s wearing.

                                    NASH
                      I feel like my legs are 
                        suffocating.

      The car approaches a modern mansion, a GLORIOUS GLASS 
        STRUCTURE perched on WolfbackRidge Road. We see the 
        unmistakable trappings of an exclusive PARTY in progress. 
        VALETS help guests from FANCY CARS, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE drink 
      and laugh on the expansive deck.

                                    NASH (CONT D)
                      What is this?  What s going on?

                                    TREY
                      Looks like The Murch is having a 
                      few people over.

                                    NASH
                      You told me we were going to a 
                      meeting. This is-- this is why you 
                      made me wear pants! You liedto me.    1/28/201317.


                                    TREY
                      No, I managed expectations. If I 
                      told you we were going to a party, 
                      you d be in the fetal position 
                      humming Hall and Oatesright now. 
                      Now stay close and don t say 
                      anything.

                                    NASH
                      What? Why?

        A VALET opens Trey s door, ending the debate.



        A BORED ATTENDANT waits with an iPad, checking a GUEST LIST.

                                    TREY
                            (nervous, speedy)
                      Hey there. Larry Page and 
                        ShamitRamdi. We should be on the--

                                    BORED ATTENDANT
                      Have a great time.

      Trey smirks to himself, pushes Nash ahead of him into...



      Trey checks his watch, impatient. Looks across the DECK and 
      sees LISA, the woman from Barcade, standing alone, taking in 
      the sunset. He approaches. She sees him coming--

                                    LISA
                      And just like that, a stunning 
                      view... ruined.

                                    TREY
                      I didn t catch your name last 
                      night. Trey Thornhill.

      He extends his hand, but she doesn t return the offer.

                                    TREY (CONT D)
                      I just came over to tell you that I 
                      wasn t hitting on you last night.  
                      You re not even my type, I prefer 
                      tall women with blond hair. No 
                      freckles, dancer s build, a little 
                      extra in the trunk is fine, far 
                      less conservative fashion sense--

                                    LISA
                      Are you for real? I need to get 
                      this on video.    1/28/201324.


                                    TREY
                    My point is, I was conducting 
                      research when I approached you and 
                      while I can see how you d 
                        misinterpret my intentions, I 
                      assure you they had nothing to do 
                      with sexual desire.

                                    LISA
                      Well thank God for that.
                            (wait--)
                      Did you say research?

                                    TREY
                      Yes. I m developing an app that s 
                      going to revolutionize social 
                      networking. I m here to pitch it to 
                      George Murchison.

                                    LISA
                            (not impressed)
                      Sounds promising.

                                    TREY
                    It is. Very promising. I promise.

      Just then, Nash steps outside with Lau, buddy-buddy. Trey is 
      taken aback--

                                    TREY (CONT D)
                      What the shit?

      Lisa turns, sees Lau too--

                                    LISA
                      Ah! There he is. Michael!
                            (waves Lau over)
                      Well, Trey, it s been strange.

                                    TREY
                      You re with Michael Lau?

                                    LISA
                      With, with? God no. George 
                      Murchison invested in him. And as 
                      Mr. Murchison s Senior Analyst, 
                      it s my job to make sure that 
                      investment pays off.

      Panic takes hold as Trey realizes what he just stepped in.  
      Lau smiles at Trey, goes for a high five--

                                    LAU
                      Thornhillin the hay-ouse!    1/28/201325.


      But Trey leaves Lau hanging, too stunned to react.  

 END OF ACT TWO. 

                                    ACT THREE



      Trey speed-walks away from Lau and Lisa, grabbing Nash by the 
      elbow and dragging him with--

                                    TREY
                      That s Murch s gatekeeper, and she 
                      doesn t like me.  We need to find 
                      him while she s busy with Lau--

                                    NASH
                            (mouth full of satay)
                      But he said to call next week--

                                    TREY
                      We re done waiting. Time to see the 
                      wizard.


        doesn t like u.

                                                                      CUT TO BLACK.
