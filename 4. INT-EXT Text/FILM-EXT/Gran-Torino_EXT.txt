Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk. He deliberately
stops at the boundary of his property.
The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now
mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged
to Polish families.
Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on.
Walt can see through the window that the living room is
jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong.
And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full-
blown, unrepentant racist.
Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.
WALT
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats
can they cram into a living room?
Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.

People are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling,
stiff-jointed old Pollacks.
Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are
more Hmong going up the sidewalk. They laugh and chatter
and carry big dishes of food and fruit. They are a happy
bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home.
The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony. A three-day-old
baby is named and three souls are located for the
newborn.
CUT TO:
ANOTHER ANGLE
Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old
ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables
to their dead battery.
Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a
brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window.
MITCH
I'd really like to help, Dad, but
we have to get the kids home,
they're getting restless.
Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser
and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance.
WALT
Fine. Go.
MITCH
I'll call in a few, see how you're
doing.
Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off.
WALT
Kill you to buy American.

The house is a buzz of activity. The older Hmong speak
their native language, the younger generation speaks both
English and Hmong.
(NOTE: Hmong is subtitled when necessary.)
Tao's Grandmother (PHONG) complains to a MAN.
PHONG
(SUBTITLED)
There's no man in this house,
that's why my daughter should
remarry. Being a second wife is
better than having a woman be the
head of the household. It's not
our way.

He's the man in the house.
PHONG

Tao's not a man.
(GESTURES)
Look at him in the kitchen,
washing dishes like a woman. Even
his sister gives him orders and he
obeys.
The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of
dishes. An older relative drops dishes in the sink,
without acknowledging Tao's presence. It's clearly an
insult.
In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong Soul Calling ceremony
starts its next phase. An elder, the family SHAMAN, is
present and begins the ritual.
As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch. Tao slips
on his coat and goes out the back door.

Tao wobbles as he pedals his bike through the snow.
Tao passes Walt's garage and is startled as Walt appears
from a shadow, JUMPER CABLES in his hands. They make eye
contact as Tao passes.
Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy.
WALT
I thought these zips were supposed
to be such hard workers. Christ,
I had my own car when I was his
age.

Tao exits the store, gets on his bike and rides off.

A few blocks away, Tao rides past a snowbank when --
WHAM! A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his
front wheel. Tao flies over the handlebars into the
snow.
A chorus of laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand
around the stunned, prone Tao.
HEAD LATINO
Whatta you gonna do, gook? You
gonna Kung Fu' us?
Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike.
LATINO #2
Surprised it ain't a girl's bike.
The Latinos laugh. Tao remains on the ground.
HEAD LATINO
You gonna get up or what?
Tao doesn't move.
HEAD LATINO
Tell you what, I'll let you take
the first swing. You drop me and
you can have your bike back.
Tao smiles, he can't help it.
HEAD LATINO
What the fuck you smiling at,
gook? Something funny?
He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet.
HEAD LATINO
You better get the fuck outta
here, bitch.
He pushes Tao backwards. Tao falls back into the snow.
This time Tao crab-walks back away from the Latinos.
The Latinos stroll away with Tao's bike.

Walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors' houses.
Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors'
houses are rundown.
Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped
screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has installed
a chicken coop.
Walt looks down at Daisy --
WALT
Damn chinks let their yards go to
hell. Polarski would turn over in
his grave if he could see what
they did to his lawn.
Tao walks past. Walt watches him pass.
WALT
I don't know why these goddamned
slopes had to move to my block.
This used to be a nice
neighborhood.

Tao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking
chair. PHONG nods back to Tao, then turns her evil eye
back on Walt, whom she's been seething at all morning.
PHONG
(SUBTITLED)
Why doesn't that stupid, hairy
white man move? He must be too
dumb to realize he's not welcome
here. All the Mee-Khah left in
the neighborhood should just move
away. Look at him strut like a
rooster.
She sees Walt glance at her and spit. Phong glares back
and spits beetle juice, which has turned her teeth black.

Tao walks down the street, his head in a book. He
finally realizes there's a blue Chevy following slowly
behind him.
The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace
with his step. Tao looks over to the occupants of the
Chevy.
It's two LATINOS. Tao quickens his pace, but the Chevy
easily keeps up with Tao.
LATINO DRIVER
Is you a boy or a girl, I can't
tell?
LATINO #2
What you reading, gook, Jackass
And The Rice Stalk?
Tao laughs, but keeps walking.
LATINO DRIVER
That's right, you keep walking.
Fucking slopes everywhere you
look, man. Why gooks come up in
here and fuck up our neighborhood?
Down the street -- is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC with a big
SPOILER on the back. Inside are five Hmong gangbangers.
The Hmong gangbangers notice Tao being followed by the
Latinos. SPIDER, the driver, squints and then points at
Tao.
SPIDER
Dude, that's my little cousin,
Tao.
SMOKIE
You sure about that, Spider?
SPIDER
I'm sure. Do we do something...
or what?
Smokie is the gang leader. He looks at Tao for a second.
SMOKIE
Your cousin tight with anyone?

Smokie nods to Spider, they roar up and stop right across
from Tao and the Latinos' car.
SMOKIE
You better not be giving my bro
here a hard time or you're gonna
wish you never been born.
LATINO DRIVER
Oh goody, more Rice Niggers.
The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL.
A Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays
a sub-machine gun. The Latinos are way out-gunned.
LATINO #2
Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats. Go
back to your fucking rice paddy.
The Latinos screech their tires and are gone. The Hmongs
in the car smile and congratulate themselves.
Tao simply keeps walking down the street!
SMOKIE
Where the fuck does he think he's
going? Turn us around and go
after that cousin of yours.
They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with
him as he walks.
SPIDER
Hey, cuz, slow down, where you
going? You should really think
about hanging with us, man. If we
all stick together, shit like that
won't happen, with those Spicks.
Tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer.

You can't be such a little girl.
You join up with us, we'll keep
you out of trouble, cuz.

of Latino gangbanger types.
SMOKIE
You think about it and we'll see
you tomorrow.

Tao digs in the garden. Tao's younger sister SUE sits
and reads JANE magazine on the porch.
The tricked-out Honda with Blue Neon lights pulls up.
Spider, Smokie and two other Hmong gangbangers get out.
SPIDER
Hey, cuz. Hey, Sue.
SUE
What do you want?
SPIDER
Came to talk to my cousin Tao.
Smokie looks over to Sue.
SMOKIE
Spider, who's the other cousin?
SUE laughs at the name Spider. Sue is seventeen, has
long straight hair with red highlights.
SUE
Spider'? Is that what he just
called you, Fong?
SPIDER
This is my little cousin, Sue.
Smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue.

Sue rolls her eyes and goes inside. Smokie stares at
Tao.
SPIDER
You think about what we talked
about?
A PAUSE. Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a
cigarette. Tao shakes his head no and looks at the
ground.
SMOKIE
That's exactly the point, Tao.
Spider told me how everyone thinks
you're a pushover, how everybody
walks all over you and shit. I
mean, look at you, out here
working in the garden like a
woman.
Tao nods silently, but still looks at the ground.
SMOKIE
It ain't no big thing. You just
need a little guidance.
Tao looks up at Smokie. Tao looks a little skeptical.
SMOKIE
It's true, man. Shit, I used to
be kind of a quiet little punk
like you, everybody fucking with
me. But finally I said no more.'
You, you're lucky, Tao, we got
your back. Me? I didn't have
nobody. Had to mold my own tribe.
SPIDER
Smokie's right. We're family,

Tao squirms out of Smokie's grasp. Smokie yells at Tao
as he runs away...

Should we go after him?
SMOKIE
Naw, he's got nowhere to go.

Walt has parked the Gran Torino at an angle across his

Walt looks up again and his eyes sweep the neighborhood
in defiance. A couple of Hmong teenagers look at the
car.
WALT

That's right, ain't she pretty.
Walt drops down heavily into an old lawn chair and pops

Dusk is falling. Walt finally gets up, folds up his lawn
chair and walks stiffly back into the garage.
Walt flips on the outdoor light, highlighting the Gran
Torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway. The
whole scene looks like a mid-sixties car ad in Popular
Mechanics.
Walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen
light comes on. The Gran Torino remains in the driveway.
It's a challenge, an invitation. Walt is daring the
thief to come back. And Walt's ready this time.

The tricked-out Honda drives up, but doesn't stop at
Walt's. It pulls up in front of Tao's house. Tao and
Sue exchange looks out on the front step.
Smokie, Spider and two others get out, walking
confidently up the sidewalk towards them. They grin,
they're cocky.

Another big, tough gangbanger with

Smokie leers at Sue. It makes her uncomfortable.
SMOKIE
I got my eye on you too, little
girl.
SUE
Whatever.

Come on, Tao. Let's go.
Tao says nothing. He looks at the ground.

Don't go, Tao.

Tao tries to squirm away. Smokie grabs him by the hair
and opens his coat to reveal the PISTOL in his belt.
SMOKIE
I'm not gonna say it again. Let's
go. Now.
Tao is shoved towards the car.
Suddenly -- Sue jumps on the back of one of the
gangbangers and knocks him to the ground. Tao breaks
free.
SUE
Run, Tao, run!
Sue is slapped to the ground.
SUE
RUN!!
Tao is tackled by Smokie and punched in the face. Tao's
mother comes out the front door.
Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other
gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay.
A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into
the yard. All the gangbangers overreact and pull their
pistols. The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face
and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel.
Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie. It becomes
a pushing, rolling, surging melee.
This mess boils over and spills into Walt's front yard.

WALT
Get off my lawn.
SMOKIE
Listen, old man, you don't want...
WALT
I said get off my lawn. Now.
Walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers.
The guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big
military rifle Walt holds.
SMOKIE
Are you fucking crazy? Go back in
your house, old man.
WALT
Get off my lawn.
SMOKIE
I'm not fucking around, Gramps.
Walt spits out the side of his mouth. He grins.
WALT
Don't think for a second I won't
blow a big hole in your face and
it won't bother me a bit, not any
more than if I shot a deer. Now
get off my goddamned lawn.
Two of the Hmong gangbangers take a step back. Walt
senses their fear. Only Smokie holds his ground.
WALT
Believe me, kid, I'll blow your
damn head off, go back to bed and
sleep like a baby. I couldn't
care less.
SMOKIE
I'm not gonna warn you again!

Smokie and the gangbangers give Walt fierce looks, but
melt back towards their car.
As they get into the car -- Smokie has to say something.
SMOKIE
You better watch yourself, old
man.
The Honda screeches its tires and goes off down the
street.
Walt looks at Tao, Sue, Mom and Grandma who stand in
stunned silence in his front yard.
A PAUSE. Finally, Sue speaks up...
SUE
Thank you.
Walt lowers his rifle and spits on the ground.

Coming down the alley is another Hmong couple, they smile
carrying a basket filled with Asian vegetables.
Walt holds up his hand like a traffic cop.
WALT
No. No more.
The Hmong couple nod, say something with a smile and turn
around.
NEXT DOOR
Tao, his mother and Sue argue in the yard. They gesture
towards Walt's house. The women buzz around Tao, all
speaking in his ear at the same time.
Phong yells at them from the porch, but they ignore her.
Walt watches as the mother and Sue march Tao towards his
house. Tao looks like a whipped dog.
WALT
Why won't these people leave me
alone?
Walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts
up his hands, indicating they've come far enough.
Sue holds up a plant.
SUE
We brought you some shallots to
plant in your garden.
WALT
I don't want them.
SUE
They're perennials, they come back

No, I'm not.

Too bad, they think you are and
that's why they're bringing you

Sue walks with her ridiculous Wigger (urban white kid)
boyfriend, TREY. Trey wears big baggy pants, a sports
jersey and an Oakland Raiders visor upside-down and

They walk past three BLACK GUYS leaning against a
building. The TALL BLACK GUY spots Sue and smiles.
TALL BLACK GUY
Hey, girl, you come over here and
talk to me. Come on, baby, don't
be shy.
Trey and Sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can
to avoid the black guys. They try to ignore them.
TALL BLACK GUY
Come on, sweetie, don't be like
that. You talk to me, don't be
all stuck up and shit.
ACROSS THE STREET
Walt waits at a stoplight. He watches Sue and Trey and
the three black guys who block their path.
One black guy flips Trey's VISOR onto the ground. The
Tall Guy makes kissy faces at Sue as he touches his
crotch.
Walt sits there for a second; he shouldn't help, but Walt
solves every situation by being aggressive.
Walt drives off, then makes a U-turn.
The Tall Black Guy now focuses on Trey.

WALT
You... and your buddies. What's

offs in the middle of the day,
slowly walking across the street

little girls around, for Christ's

But you might just be dumb enough
not to recognize that your luck
just ran out.
All bravado drains away from the black guys. Walt is a

Walt grins slightly and spits on the ground.

Fuck this guy. He ain't worth it.
The trio walks slowly across the street, forcing a car to
miss a green light.
Trey puts his hand out to shake Walt's...
TREY
Man, thanks a lot, mister.
Walt doesn't extend a hand, he lets Trey stand there like

Christ all Friday. What's wrong
with kids today?
Walt gets up to go help, but before he can get to the
sidewalk, another neighbor has gone over to help...
It's TAO. Tao bends down and carries her bags up to her
door.
WALT
Well, I'll be damned.

Mitch and Karen storm out to their Land Cruiser. Mitch
carries the Gopher Grabber Tool and Karen has the big
numbered phone in her hand.
MITCH
I told you, I told you this was a
bad idea.
KAREN
I know, you were right.
MITCH
Son of a bitch! He just won't let
anyone help him.
KAREN
Well, we tried. Now we can just
drop it. No one can say we didn't
try.
MITCH
To hell with him, kicking us out
on his birthday?! We should've
stayed home with Ashley and Josh.
They knew better, they wouldn't
even come. The goddamned kids are
smarter than we are!
Mitch screeches the tires as they take off. Walt waits
for them to clear out, before coming out on the porch
with a can of Pabst.
Daisy comes out and lies at his feet.
Walt covers his mouth as he coughs. A dime-sized circle
of dark, red blood is left in the palm of his hand.
Walt looks at the blood as he takes another sip of beer.

Walt continues to sit on his porch, a long row of empty
Pabst beer cans are lined up on the railing.

Walt looks at a photo in his wallet, his and Dorothy's
wedding photo. Walt looks down at Daisy --
WALT
We miss Momma, don't we, Daisy.
A vehicle pulls up to Tao's house. A party is in full
swing.
Sue comes out and helps the Hmong women unload big
platters of food and carry them to the house.
Sue catches Walt's gaze and steps over to his porch.
SUE
Hey, Walt, what are you up to?
Walt points his index finger at the can of Pabst in his
hand.
SUE
We're having a barbecue. You want
to come over?
WALT
What do you think?
SUE
There's tons of food.
WALT
I'll bet. Just keep your paws off
my dog.
SUE
No worries, we only eat cats.
WALT
Really?
SUE
No, I'm kidding, you moron. Come
on, come on over. You can be my
special guest.
WALT
I'm fine right here.
Walt reaches into the cooler for another beer. It's
empty, just water and ice.
WALT
Son of a bitch.

Walt?
WALT
A piece of cake and some beef

SUE
Come on over and get something to
eat. We've got beer, too.
Walt exhales loudly --
WALT
Oh, what the hell. It's my
birthday, I may as well drink with
strangers instead of myself.
Walt gets up and walks with Sue towards her house.
SUE
Happy Birthday, Wally.
WALT
Don't call me Wally.

Walt empties the lawnmower bag as two elderly Hmong Women
come over, each carrying a FLOWER BOUQUET.
WALT
No. No thanks. No more flowers.
The elderly Hmong Women nod and speak rapid sentences in
Hmong to Walt. He has no idea what they are saying.
WALT
No more. Please, keep your
flowers.
The Hmong women nod, smile and chatter away, ignoring
Walt. They walk past him and set the BOUQUETS on his
porch.
WALT
(DEFEATED)
Okay, just put them on the porch.
But that's it. No more.

Walt pulls up in his pickup truck. Sue and Vu wait on
Walt's porch. Tao stands out on the sidewalk.
Walt gets out of his pickup.
WALT
What now? What?
Vu rambles on in Hmong. Walt looks at his watch. He
looks at Sue for the translation.
SUE
Tao is here to make amends, he's
here to work for you.
WALT
No he's not.
SUE
Mother says that Tao dishonored
the family and now he has to work
off his debt. He'll start
tomorrow morning.
WALT
No. The kid is useless, I don't
even want him on my property. I
thought we already went over that.
SUE
It's very important to my mother
that you accept. It'd be an
insult to refuse.
WALT
How is this all of a sudden turned
around on me? The goddamned kid
tries to steal my car and somehow
I'm the bad guy if I don't accept?

SUE
My family is very traditional and
it will very much upset them if
you don't let Tao repay...
Tao interrupts from the sidewalk...
TAO
Come on, Sue. If he doesn't want
to, let's just go.
Sue and Vu yell at Tao to shut up at the same time; Sue
in English, Vu in Hmong.
SUE/VU
Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!!
Tao looks at the ground.
A PAUSE. Walt sees the earnest looks on the Hmong
women's faces. Their expression begs Walt.
Walt gazes back at Tao. Walt looks disgusted, he exhales
loudly...
WALT
Fine. Great. Tomorrow.
Walt walks past them and into his house.
WALT
Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These
Hmong broads are like badgers.

Walt sits drinking coffee and reading the newspaper. Tao
walks sheepishly over to the property line.
WALT
Son of a bitch, I didn't think
he'd show.
Walt waves Tao over. Tao barely looks at Walt.
WALT
Okay. What are you good at?
TAO

WALT
That's about what I expected.
Okay, why don't you go over by the
spruce tree and count how many
birds feed at the bird feeder.
TAO
Count the birds?
WALT
Yeah, you can count? You slopes
are supposed to be good at math,
right?
TAO
Yes, I can count.
53

Tao stands in Walt's garden with his arms folded. Walt
walks over to trim weeds around the garden fence.
Walt doesn't even look at Tao. Finally...
TAO
You want me to do that?
WALT
No.
TAO
Why not?
WALT
I want it done right, that's why.
TAO
But you've got me just standing
here. What am I supposed to be
doing, anyway?
WALT
Scaring away crows.
Tao shoots Walt a dirty look.

Walt waters a flower bed. Tao comes over and stands
there. Walt finishes watering before even looking at
Tao.
TAO
What do you have for me today?
You want me to watch paint dry or
maybe count the clouds that pass
by?
WALT
Don't get flip with me, zipper
head. I ain't the one who tried
to steal and don't forget it.
TAO
Go ahead. I don't care if you
insult me and say racist things.
I'll take it.
WALT
That I know. You have no teeth,
kid. That's your problem. You
have no balls.
TAO
Look, I'm stuck here. Why don't
you give me something useful to
do.
WALT
Because unlike you I'm not
useless. I maintain my property,
whereas you swamp rats let your
houses go to hell.
Walt looks across the street at one very dilapidated
house.
WALT
Wait a minute... How long do I
have you for?
Tao pauses... he doesn't want to answer.
WALT
How long, Toad?

Till next Friday.
Walt laughs out loud. It makes Tao cringe.
WALT
Go get my ladder out of the
garage.
CUT TO:

Tao is at the top of the LADDER. Walt and the Hmong
neighbor grin at him from the bottom.
WALT
When you're done caulking the
siding, nail that gutter back up,
I can see it right out my kitchen
window, it's been bugging me for
three years.
The neighbor says something in Hmong to Walt.
WALT
You said it, brother.
56
56
Tao digs up a big TREE STUMP out in the rain. It's hard,
draining labor and Tao is covered with mud.
Tao's shovel hits rocks and roots and clay. Misery.
57
57
We see Tao do various chores; scrape paint, hang screen
doors, reattach house numbers, trim bushes, etc.
Walt scrutinizes his every move. Tao is a virtual slave.
58

Walt watches with great satisfaction as Tao paints one of
the neighboring houses. The neighborhood is really
shaping up.
Walt sips his coffee with a slight grin. He is really,
really, really enjoying this.

A very old Hmong man and his very young GRANDSON walk up
Walt's driveway. The Grandson translates for grandpa.
GRANDSON
Grandpa says he want to know if
you can have Tao clear out the big
wasp nest under our porch?
Walt reaches in his pocket and studies a small note pad.
WALT
I don't see why not.
(GRINS )
Tell him sometime after lunch.
59
59
Tao walks up the sidewalk. Before ringing the doorbell,
Tao looks down at his hands which have several CALLOUSES
on them.
Tao rubs his hands with a smile. This has been the first
time Tao has really risen to a task presented to him.
Tao reaches for the doorbell...
65
65
While Walt fills a bird feeder, he notices Tao next door.
Tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder,
trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw.
Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao.
WALT
Hey, moron.
Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.
TAO
What?
WALT
I appreciate you're doing
something on your own, but you're
the only person I know dumb enough
to get himself killed trimming
tree branches.
TAO
What now?
WALT
You don't stand on the top step of
a ladder and if you cut through
that branch you're hacking away
at, you'll end up kaput.
Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black POWER LINE is
five feet below the branch he's almost severed.
WALT
Go grab the extension ladder from
my garage and I'll show you how to
do it right, zipper head.
CUT TO:

Tao ties up bundles of branches and twigs. Walt lights a
cigarette, looks up in the tree and nods.
WALT
Looks good. Good job.
Tao nods.

WALT
Make sure you put the ladder back
when you're done raking up the
leaves.
TAO
I know. I will.
Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the
cooler and watches Tao rake.
A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past
Tao.
Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass.
WALT
This kid doesn't have a chance.
The Honda now slowly passes Walt's house. Walt just
stands there, sipping his beer.
The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at
Walt.
The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens.
Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN. He closes one
eye to better aim his imaginary gun and moves his thumb
several times as if firing. Bang -- bang -- bang.
The Honda takes off. Walt watches it drive off and
lights another cigarette.
Walt doesn't notice, but Tao witnessed this whole
interaction from his yard.
74
74
Tao and Walt ease the freezer down the back steps and
pause to take a break. They both breathe hard.
TAO
That thing weighs a ton.
WALT
Yeah, but it runs like new. They
don't make them like that anymore.
TAO
What are you going to do with it?
WALT
Sell it. I haven't used it in
years and it was always in the way
down there.
TAO
How much?
WALT
Oh, I don't know. Sixty bucks,
maybe. Why, you need a freezer?
TAO
(NODS)
Our downstairs one died.
Walt thinks for a second.
WALT
Twenty-five and it's yours.

Walt and Sue sit eating Laab as they watch Tao, who

Sue laughs and shakes her head.
SUE
Kind of ironic, huh?
WALT
What?
SUE
What the hell do you think I'm
referring to? Toad washing the
car he tried to steal from you.
WALT
It seems like justice to me. And
if he misses a spot, he's doing it
all over.
SUE
It's nice of you to kind of look
after him like this. He doesn't
have any real role models in his
life.
WALT
I ain't a role model.
SUE
You're a good man, Wally. I wish
our dad would have been more like
you.
WALT
Don't call me Wally.
SUE
No, I'm serious. He was hard on
us, really traditional, really old
school.
WALT
I'm old school.
SUE
Yeah, but you're American.
WALT
What's that supposed to mean?
Sue shrugs him off. They look at Tao for awhile.

SUE
You like him, don't you?
WALT
Him? Don't be crazy. He tried to
steal my car.
SUE
And you spend time with him and
you teach him how to fix things
and you saved him from that fuck
cousin of ours and...
WALT
Hey. Watch the language.
SUE
And you're a good man.
WALT
Hand me a beer, Dragon Lady.
Sue hands him a beer and Walt pops the top.
WALT
So tell me the problem with Hmong
boys again. I'm not completely
clear.
SUE
Hmong girls slip in and out of the
culture more easily. Date who we
want, stay close to our mothers,
but are able to keep a foot on
each side of the fence. The boys
fall through the cracks.
WALT
Why?
SUE
It's tough. The boys float
around. The fathers belong in a
totally different world and the
boys have no one to turn to. Does
that make sense?
WALT
Not sure. No.
SUE
The boys don't ask their fathers
for advice, because over here,
their fathers no longer have the
answers.

boys go to jail.

It's more common than not.
Walt reflects on this for awhile, then changes the
subject.
WALT
You still going out with that
clown?
SUE
No. I dumped him. He was a dim-
wit.
Walt nods.
WALT
Good girl.

Walt and Tao spread mulch around Walt's vegetable plants.
TAO
You know, the Hmong consider
gardening to be women's work.
WALT
Is that why I see you out in your
garden all the time? Besides,
zipper head, we ain't in Hu-Mong.
TAO
Funny.
Walt lights a cigarette.

You should quit those. It's bad

You've never thought about it?
TAO
Of course I have.
WALT
Well, while you're thinking about
it, try not to stomp all over my
chives, you dipshit.
Tao looks down; sure enough, he's standing on Walt's
chives.
TAO
Sorry.
WALT
Put some mulch around the
cucumbers.
Tao spreads more mulch.
TAO
I was thinking about sales, maybe.
WALT
My oldest son's a salesman. He
sells cars.
TAO
Does he do well?
WALT
License to steal. I worked in a
Ford plant for thirty years and my
son sells goddamned Japanese cars.

TAO
Does your son come over much?
WALT
How are you going about getting
into sales? You thinking about
school?
TAO
Kinda.
WALT
Well, you should.
TAO
School costs money.
WALT
Maybe you should get a job and
save instead of spreading mulch in
my garden.
TAO
Maybe you could just pay me.
WALT
That's funny.
TAO
What kind of job could I get?
WALT
Good question. Who the hell would

You said yourself I'm worthless

That's exactly the point. I know

Yum too.

Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it

destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building.
SMOKIE
You can't just walk away from us,

Walt swings the barrel of the big Colt .45 at the

It's a cat. Walt puts his pistol away. Smokie exhales.
WALT
It's just you and me. Nobody

You lay off Tao. Tell your guys
he ain't worth it or whatever the
hell you want. You don't talk to

ugly.
Walt kicks Smokie again and stalks off into the dark.

Walt pulls up his driveway and parks. Daisy jumps out
and Walt carries his rifle into the house. Walt walks
stiffly.
Walt gets to the door and drops his keys. When he bends
down to pick them up, you can really tell he's sore and
hurting.
Walt groans as he goes inside. He's feeling his age.

Vu, Sue, Tao and Wa Xam all sit in lawn chairs, talking
and laughing. Walt flips the inch-thick STEAKS on his
Weber.
WALT
How do you want your dog... I mean
steaks cooked? Medium, medium
well?
TAO
Funny.
Walt pops open a beer and grabs an appetizer that Vu
made.
WALT
Is this Hmoog or Laab?
SUE
Laab.
WALT
Isn't it usually a little spicier?
Tao, Wa Xam and Sue laugh.
SUE
Oh whatever, Wally.
WALT
It does. Usually it's got more
zing.
SUE
Jesus Christ, look at you. I've
never seen you like this.
WALT
What?

SUE
Look at you smile, old man.
Kicking back, having a good old
time. You're sure pleased with
yourself today.
TAO
And it's a little unnerving if you
ask me.
WALT
Aw, go on.
SUE
No, admit it. You are. You're
feeling pretty good, aren't you?
WALT
Well, who wouldn't? I'm
surrounded by beautiful women,
it's a beautiful day. Great food,
good friends. Hell, even Toad
isn't driving me nuts for once.
TAO
It never ends.
WALT
I'm just kidding. Let me tell you
something, Yum-Yum. If Tao
doesn't ask you out soon, I will.
SUE
Don't listen to him, Wa Xam. He's
a white devil.
WA XAM
(LAUGHS)
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you
to it.
WALT
I'll be damned. Movie? Dinner?
Wa Xam and Tao nod. They're a bit embarrassed.
SUE
Yeah, they're taking the bus.
WALT
The bus?! That's no good. A
charming young lady like this
deserves to go in style.

TAO
Like what? Take a limo?
Walt nods towards the GRAN TORINO.
TAO
The Gran Torino? You'd let me
drive it?
WALT
Sure. Why not.
TAO
Really?
Walt smiles.
WALT
Really.
They shake hands.

Walt is up their front steps and in the house in seconds.
Walt goes from room to room, from Vu to Phong finally to
Tao -- making sure no one's been hit.
WALT
Is everyone okay? Is anyone hit?
Sue? Vu? Tao, where's Tao?
Tao sits up from behind the couch. Blood pours down his
neck. He's stunned.
WALT
Oh no.
Walt lays Tao down and rips open the collar of his shirt.
Walt probes around Tao's neck.

TAO
What... what is it?
WALT
Hang on... you're just cut, is
all.
TAO
Is everybody else okay?
WALT
Yeah.
Walt looks around at the BULLET HOLES in the walls. Tao
follows his gaze.
TAO
It's a miracle no one was killed.
WALT
They aimed high.
Sure enough -- most of the bullet holes are above head
level on the walls.
WALT
Where's Sue?
TAO
She went to our aunt's.
WALT
Call her.
TAO
What?
WALT
I said call her. Get the
goddamned phone and call and see
if she's there.
Tao scrambles for the phone and dials.
Tao speaks Hmong to whomever answered. Tao starts to
speak faster. He looks at Walt and shakes his head no.
For once -- Vu and Phong understand what Walt was talking
about. There is anguish on every face in the room.

Walt bursts in the door, throws himself in an easy chair
and CRIES. He tries to stop and cries harder.
It's the first time Walt has cried in fifty years. He
wails, crying for Tao, Sue, his wife, kids and himself.
He lets it all out. Daisy jumps in his lap and he hugs
his old dog as he bawls.

Walt meticulously mows his lawn. He carefully trims
around the fence and birdbath.

Walt walks out his front door with Daisy on her leash.
He walks over to Tao's house.
Phong sits in a lawnchair and glares at Walt. She yells
in Hmong as Walt walks straight up to her.
WALT
Aw, pipe down, you hag.
PHONG
(SUBTITLED)
You're an evil man. I've seen
your kind before. Back home,
white soldiers came to our
villages and filled our young
men's minds with ideas of glory.
Then you'd lead them away to their
deaths.
Walt, of course, has no idea what she said.
WALT
Fine, I hate you too.

Walt holds out the DOG LEASH to Phong. She looks down at
Daisy and back at Walt. She lashes out again in Hmong.
WALT
I need you to watch my dog.
Walt holds the leash closer. Phong folds her arms in
defiance. Walt exhales loudly.
Walt lifts up one of the LEGS OF HER LAWNCHAIR and slips
the loop of the leash underneath it so Daisy can't follow
him.
WALT
Her name is Daisy.
Walt bends down on one knee and lovingly pets Daisy. He
scratches her belly.
WALT
You take it easy, old gal. You
good old girl.
Walt gets up and walks away without looking back.
Phong is stunned; she is silent for once.

Father Janovich paces back and forth. The SQUAD CAR
pulls up to him, which is exactly what he's been afraid
of all day.
OFFICER
Sorry, Father, we have to go.
FATHER JANOVICH
I'm telling you. If we're not
here, there will be bloodshed.
OFFICER
We've been here for hours. We
can't afford to anchor a unit to
one location.
FATHER JANOVICH
I'm begging you to stay.
OFFICER
I just got word from my Sergeant,
we're pulling the plug.
FATHER JANOVICH
I'm staying.
OFFICER
No you aren't. My orders are
specific. You came with us,
you're leaving with us.
Father Janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting
into the SQUAD CAR. The SQUAD CAR drives off.
Walt pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams
the door. He looks at the duplex. It's a total eyesore.
WALT
(MUTTERS)
What a goddamned mess. You slopes
should be ashamed of yourselves.

Walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the
duplex.
Six very scared, very jittery Hmong gangbangers look out
at Walt from various doorways and windows.
WALT
Is that all you swamp rats or is
there more vermin scurrying in the
shadows?
Smokie and Spider step out and stand on the porch.
Smokie smiles at Walt. Walt spits on the ground.
SMOKIE
I wasn't sure that you'd...
WALT
Shut up, gook. I'm not here to
listen to one goddamned syllable
of what a shrimp-dicked little
baby midget like you has to say.
Spider pulls his PISTOL.
WALT
That's right, boy. Defend your
boyfriend after he or you or
whoever rapes a member of your
family. Your own blood, for
Christ's sake. Go ahead, pull
your pistols, just like a bunch of
ridiculous miniature toy cowboys.
Smokie and several other Hmong gangbangers pull their
guns.
WALT
You have no honor. You're the
scum of the earth and when you're
gone, do you think anyone will
care? No one will mourn. You
won't be missed.
All the Hmong are spooked at Walt's absolute lack of
fear.
SMOKIE
Where's Tao, old man? He too
scared to come and stick up for
himself?

WALT
No. Tao is too good for this.
You pukes aren't worth one second
of his time.
Walt slowly puts a CIGARETTE in his mouth. Even this
slight movement has the gangbangers waving their PISTOLS
around.
Walt laughs.
WALT
You boys are a little bit jumpy.
SPIDER
You watch it, old man.
WALT
No, I think you'd better watch it.
Walt looks around. Other than the gangbangers, a small
group of people have gathered to watch this showdown.

WALT AND COMPANY...
WALT
Anybody got a light? No? I got
one.
Walt's slight grin fades. He mutters to himself...
WALT
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Walt reaches into his coat pocket. Six Hmong gangbangers
simultaneously level their PISTOLS and FIRE.
BULLETS FLY. Walt is struck down. People scream.
Walt falls dead. A ZIPPO lighter clutched in his hand.
Walt never intended to kill anyone. Self-sacrifice.

Tao and Sue arrive just as Smokie, Spider and company are
being driven away in Police cars.
Tao looks at Smokie in the squad car. Smokie no longer
looks tough or hard, he just looks scared.
On the street, Walt is being bagged by the ambulance
crew. Father Janovich prays over him.
Tao steps up to a POLICE OFFICER.
TAO
What happened?
POLICE OFFICER
You have to step back.
TAO
He was a friend of mine.
POLICE OFFICER
I said step back.
Tao turns to the HMONG POLICE OFFICER.
TAO
What happened, man?
The Hmong Police Officer looks at the WHITE POLICE
OFFICER and then to Tao.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER
You heard him, step back.
Tao speaks to the HMONG OFFICER in their native language.
TAO
(SUBTITLED)
Please, man, it's important. He's
my friend. Tell me what happened?
HMONG POLICE OFFICER
(SUBTITLED)
The old guy reaches for a lighter
and they gunned him down. The
gang said the old guy was here to
kill them, but he didn't have a
weapon.
TAO
(SUBTITLED)
What's going to happen?

HMONG POLICE OFFICER
(SUBTITLED)
We actually have witnesses for
once. These guys are going away
big time.
The WHITE OFFICER yells at the HMONG OFFICER.
POLICE OFFICER
Officer Chang, get those people
back.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER
Yes, sir. You have to step back
now.
Tao hugs his sister. Sue openly weeps. Tao holds it in.
He looks at his friend Walt as the bag is zipped over
him.

Tao and Sue wait in front. Tao wears a suit, Sue is in a
traditional Hmong dress. A TAXI pulls up and they get
in.
Sitting on the porch is Phong who rocks back and forth in
her rocking chair. Phong holds Daisy in her arms, gently
petting the old dog.
