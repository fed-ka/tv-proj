KELLER runs into the house and up the dark stairs.
KELLER bursts into the bedroom where KATE is screaming
at the crib, her look intent on the baby and terrible.

His face has something like fury in it, crying the child's
name; KATE almost fainting presses her knuckles to her
mouth, to stop her own cry.
FADE OUT
The stairs in the Keller House. In the foreground we see
the bannisters, in the background the wall. A shadow.of
the erratic, staggering figure of 5 year old HELEN appears
on the wall, moving slowly. The two Negro children
scamper past -- their excited laughter coming to us, in
contrast to the mute HELEN. In CU, in the FG, HELEN'S
little hands come into the frame, grasping the bannister
rail.
There is a Christmas tree with decorations and in a WIDE
SHOT we see HELEN, 7 years old, reaching up into tree.
At a window we see the faces of Percy 8 years, and Martha,
7 years, looking in. HELENrS hand gets a Christmas ball
and rips it down, shattering at her feet. CRAB IN AND
AROUND coming to the side of the tree, seeing HELENtS
hands, another ball, she pulls it down. We see her face,
blurred out, through the pine branches and needles, and
beyond her the other children watching.

CAPTAIN X LLER is at work at his deal. JA ES is at

slowly by A"MITT W, leaving behind JAILS & FELLER.

her own eyes in question.

Eyes?
HELEN nods energetically.
She wants the doll to have eyes.
Another kind of silence now, while KATE takes pins and
buttons from the sewing basket and attaches them to the
doll as eyes. KELLER stands, caught, and watches
morosely, AUNT EV blinks and conceals her emotion by
inspecting her dress.
AUNT EV
My goodness me, I'm not decent.
KATE
She doesn't know better, Aunt Ev.
I'll sew them on again.
AUNT EV
(INDULGENTLY)
40 It's worth a couple of buttons,
Kate, look.
HELEN now has the doll with eyes, and cannot contain
herself for joy; she rocks the doll, pats it vigorously,
kisses it.
This child has more sense than
all these men Kellers, if there's
ever any way to reach that mind
of hers.

HESITATINGLY OVERTURNS IT.

twist.
KELLER
Now what?
KATE
She wants to talk, like -- be like
you and me.
She holds HELEN struggling until we HEAR from the child
her first sound so far, an inarticulate weird noise in
her throat such as an animal in a trap might make; and
KATE releases her. The second she is free, HELEN
blunders away collides violently with a chair, falls,
and sits weeping. KATE comes to her, embraces, caresses,
soothes her, and buries her own face in her hair, until
she can control her voice.

Every day she slips further away.
I don't know how to call her back.

Oh, I've a mind to write to Boston

her, maybe they'll know somebody
who can.
