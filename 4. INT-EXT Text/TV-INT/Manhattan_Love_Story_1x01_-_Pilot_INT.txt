  We re in the Village, streets still crowded with people 
  heading home from work, shopping, going to dinner...

  PETER is walking towards the camera.  He s 30ish, a good 
  looking guy.  His eyes move back and forth, looking at the 
  people heading towards him.

  PETER S POV:

  We see that his gaze is flitting from woman to woman, landing 
  on each one briefly.  The men don t even exist to him - 
  they re blurs on the way to the next woman.  He s deciding 
  whether or not he d sleep with every woman that he sees.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                Yes.  (NEXT)  No.  (NEXT)  Yes, but 
                don t have a shot.  Maybe when I was 
                in college.  If she was drunk and 
                trying to get back at her boyfriend 
                who cheated on her.  (NEXT, SHE S IN 
                HER 50s)  Yes.  But for how long?  
                Five more years?  I wonder what the 
                oldest woman I d have sex with is.  
                When I m sixty, will sixty year old 
                women look good to me, or are they 
                just my only option?

  Peter spots a gorgeous woman with huge breasts, cleavage 
  showing.  The bottom half of her body is blocked from view.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                God yes.  Yes, yes, a thousand times-

  The rest of her comes into sight:  she s hugely pregnant.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                Yes.  Probably.  I don t know.

  Looks back from the belly to the breasts.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                Yes.


  Same type of crowd, and this time we pick up DANA walking 
  towards the camera.  30ish, pretty, smiles and nods to 
  everyone whose eye she catches, unlike most New Yorkers, who 
  just keep their heads down as they move through the city.

  DANA S POV:                                                                                      2.

  Her gaze is also moving from woman to woman, but instead of 
  figuring out if she d sleep with them, she s focusing on 
  their purses.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                No, yes, yes if I m meeting the queen, 
                not a chance...

  Dana notices a man - not just any man, an incredibly handsome 
  Adonis of a man.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Wow.

  She looks next to him - there s another man, maybe even more 
  handsome, if that s possible.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Wow.

  She looks down - they re holding hands.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Of course.

  Dana stops at a red light.  A woman stops next to her - Dana 
  glances over.  Glances down.  The woman and Dana are wearing 
  the exact same pair of distinctive shoes.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                God, I can t believe how much better 
                they look on her than me.  I look like 
                one of Cinderella s stepsisters, 
                  squeezing her gruesome fat feet into a 
                glass slipper.  Do I have weird 
                ankles?  Is there an exercise for 
                ankles?

  The light changes and the woman walks away.

  Dana continues down the street, and during a lull in 
    pedestrians, one man comes around the corner and into sight:  
  Peter.  He s the first person to meet her eye.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Not bad.

  PETER S POV:

  Peter looks at Dana looking at him.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                Yes.

  [Note:  When Peter and Dana meet for real, they won t 
  remember this encounter - it s just a little bit of kismet to 
  start the series.]

                                  END OF COLD OPEN                                                                                      3.


                                        ACT ONE


  Every room in the apartment has been decorated expensively, 
  but tastefully.  Not an orchid or framed vintage New Yorker 
  cover out of place.

  Two people here:  first, DAVID is sitting at the kitchen 
  table, reading his iPad.  Handsome, slick...  and way too 
  worried about what people think of him.  He s the kind of guy 
  who reads books he doesn t understand just so he can say he 
  read them.  

  David s wife is AMY, and she s putting breakfast on the 
  table.  Amy is Dana s age, and as perfectly put together as 
  her apartment.  Amy is sure she knows the correct course of 
  action for herself and every other person in her life.

  Dana comes into the room, dressed and ready for work.

                              AMY
                First day of work!

                              DANA
                First day of work!

                              AMY
                Love the outfit.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Do you?  Or is there one thing that 
                only you could think of that would 
                make it a hundred percent better?

  Amy pulls off her necklace, puts it around Dana s neck.

                              AMY
                There.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Close one.  I almost dressed myself.

                              AMY
                Oh, and David s brother is going to 
                call today to ask you out.

                              DANA
                Is that my horoscope?  It s awfully 
                  specific.

                              AMY
                His name s Peter.  He s great.
                      (to David)
                You told him, right?

                              DAVID
                He can t wait.                                                                                      4.

                              DANA
                I just got to New York.

                              AMY
                Dating works the same here.

                              DANA
                I m just...  New city, new job, I m 
                focusing on other things.  First day 
                of work, remember?

                              AMY
                  Manhattan s too expensive for a single 
                woman.  If you want to eat at great 
                  restaurants, you need a boyfriend.

                              DAVID
                Very nineteen fifties housewife.  
                That s why I love you, babe.

                              AMY
                Besides, we can do couples stuff and 
                you won t feel like a third wheel.

                              DANA
                I ve been here three days.  I didn t 
                realize it was getting awkward.

                              AMY
                Not yet.  You re going to love him.
                      (then)
                Here, I baked some muffins for you to 
                share with everyone. 

  Amy hands Dana a basket and bustles her towards the door.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Did I say  yes?   I can t remember.  
                She s like a Jedi.


  An old office stacked up with paper and samples - trophies 
  and awards of every size, shape and material.  Judging by the 
  dust and furniture, this place has been here for decades.  

  A few offices ring the bullpen in the middle.  We go inside 
  one of those offices to find...


  Peter s at his desk, tapping away on his computer.  He s got 
  the confidence of a guy who s in control of his world... 
  well, at least his work.

                              PETER
                Where are you?                                                                                      5.

                              DAVID (V.O.)
                In the lobby.  Walking in in literally 
                ten seconds.

                                                                      INTERCUT WITH:


  David s in the back of a cab, on his cell phone.

                              DAVID
                You ve got to call one of Amy s 
                friends and ask her out.

                              PETER
                Do I know her?

                              DAVID
                Nope.  Just moved here, they haven t 
                seen each other since college.

                              PETER
                I m not a real fan of blind dates.

                              DAVID
                  I already told Amy you d do it.  You 
                want to tell her I was lying?

                              PETER
                I think you should tell her.

                              DAVID
                Yeah, that s not gonna happen.  Her 
                name s Dana, she was Amy s sorority 
                sister.

                              PETER
                Well, that s promising.

                              DAVID
                That s nothing.  Rumor has it that 
                they used to get drunk and hook up.

                              PETER
                Hook up, dance at a party and kiss 
                each other when they knew everyone was 
                  watching, or-

                              DAVID
                Hook up, back in their room, door 
                locked, tie on the door, illegal in 
                Texas full sapphic debauchery.  

                              PETER
                God damn.

  In David s cab, he notices the cab driver listening to him.  
  He swipes his phone, pulls up a picture of Amy, holds it 
  forward for the cab driver to see.                                                                                      6.

                              DAVID
                My wife.

                              CAB DRIVER
                  I wouldn t kick her out of bed.

                              DAVID
                Right?

  David turns his attention back to the call:

                              DAVID (CONT'D)
                Amy refuses to confirm it, but she 
                doesn t deny it, either.  It haunts 
                me.  I ve got to be honest, it s half 
                the reason I married her.
                      (then)
                I m sending you her info.

  Peter and David hang up.  

  Back on Peter, as his phone chimes with a text.  He turns 
  back to his computer, starts typing.  After a moment, his 
  sister (CHLOE) sticks her head in.  Chloe takes nothing 
    seriously, ever.  She s awesome.

                              CHLOE
                Whatcha doin ?

                              PETER
                Working.

                              CHLOE
                You just logged onto Facebook.

                              PETER
                You spend all day monitoring Facebook?

                              CHLOE
                Yep.  

                              PETER
                Ugh.  Look at the profile picture of 
                this girl Amy s setting me up with.

                              CHLOE
                Which one is she?

                              PETER
                The ugly one.

                              CHLOE
                How do you know?

                              PETER
                If you re pretty, are you going to 
                risk having people think you re the 
                wrong one?  But if you re ugly, you re 
                counting on it.                                                                                      7.

                              CHLOE
                No one thinks like you.

                              PETER
                Everyone thinks like me.


  Dana rides along on the bus, phone in hand, basket of muffins 
  in her lap.  She types something, hits return, looks puzzled.  
  A moment later, her phone rings.  She picks up - it s Amy.

                                                                      INTERCUT WITH:


  Amy is folding origami as classical music plays in the 
  background.  Her laptop is open next to her.

                              AMY
                Why did you just type  Peter Cooper  
                in your status update?

                              DANA
                  I didn t.  I was searching for his 
                profile.

                              AMY
                No, you just put it in your status 
                update, and every person you know now 
                knows you re stalking him.

  Dana pulls the phone away from her head so she can look.

                              DANA
                No no no no no...  Undo, where s the 
                undo?  Messages are coming in!  People 
                are seeing it!   Who s Peter Cooper?   
                 Do you have a new boyfriend? 

                              AMY
                Dana, just-

  Dana puts the phone back to her head.

                              DANA
                What d you say?  I can t fix it and 
                talk to you at the same time.

                              AMY
                  Speakerphone.

  Dana does.  She s now broadcasting the conversation to the 
  people next to her on the bus.

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                Go to the upper right corner-                                                                                      8.

                              DANA
                This screen is tiny!  I can t see 
                  anything.  I just want to smash it.

                              AMY
                Yes, if you break your phone, the 
                internet disappears.
                      (then)
                Just give me your password and I ll do 
                it.

  Dana looks around.  Everyone is silent and staring at her - 
  no one s bothering to pretend they re not curious.

                              DANA
                Muggles.

  The people around Dana laugh.

                              DANA (CONT'D)
                Oh, I m the only person in the whole 
                world who reads Harry Potter.

                              AMY
                All right.  It s taken care of, and I

  An entire floor of a large building, but there are a lot of 
  empty cubicles.  A dozen employees are gathered around BARRY, 
  who s carrying a box and making his way to the elevator.

                                EMPLOYEES
                We re going to miss you, Barry./Stay 
                in touch./Stop by anytime./Love you.

  The elevator DINGS and opens.  Dana steps out as Barry steps 
  in.  Dana finds herself face to face with all of the people.

                              DANA
                Um, hi.  I m-

  The elevator doors close behind her.  Every person 
  immediately turns and hurries back into the cubicles, leaving 
  Dana alone.  Weird.  Dana follows them.


  Everyone who saw Barry off is picking through the cubicle, 
  grabbing office supplies.  Pens, post-its, legal pads, 
  everything.  Two employees have their hands on his chair.

                              EMPLOYEE #1
                Your chair s already better than mine.

                              EMPLOYEE #2
                Is that an ergonomic keyboard?                                                                                      9.

  When the first employee looks, the second yanks the chair 
  away.  He almost crashes into Dana, who s taking in the 
  scene.  She clears her throat.  A few people look up.

                              DANA
                Hi, I m Dana Hopkins?  The new junior 
                editor?

  That gets everyone s attention 100%.

                                EMPLOYEES
                New as in just hired?/Who hired 
                  you?/What department?

  A sweaty man in his 50s, ERIC, rushes up.

                              ERIC
                Dana!  Didn t hear you come in.  All 
                right, everybody-

                              EMPLOYEE #3
                You just hired her?  Barry s elevator 
                hasn t even made it to the lobby yet.

                              ERIC
                There s been some cutbacks at the 
                higher levels.  But we re optimistic 
                that things are picking up, which is 
                why I m going to bring in some new 
                  employees, to help all of you.  

  Grumbles from the employees.  They don t seem convinced.

                              ERIC (CONT'D)
                This is a good thing.  Dana, you re 
                going to be working for Brian and Sue 
                here.  Guys, whatever you need, you 
                ask her.  She s here for you, okay?

  BRIAN and SUE are stonefaced.

                              ERIC (CONT'D)
                  Excellent.  If anyone needs me, I ll 
                be in my-

                              VOICE IN CROWD
                Bunker.

                              ERIC
                Office.  Who said that?  You re next.  
                Ha ha, little joke.  Come on, guys.  
                Lighten up.  It s getting better.

  Eric scurries back to his office.  The rest of the employees 
  disappear with their plunder.  Dana turns to Brian and Sue.

                              DANA
                So, who should-                                                                                    10.

  Both of them turn and walk away without saying a word.  She 
  turns and looks at the desk beside her, which is empty.

                              DANA (CONT'D)
                Who stole my muffins?  Those were for 
                  everyone!


  All of the employees (twenty, thirty people) are gathered in 
  the main room, standing in a line.  At the head of the line 
  is GARY.  Gary isn t just the boss to his staff, he s the 
  king - benevolent when respected, cruel when not.

  People walk up to Gary, he hands them an envelope, and the 
  following exchange happens again and again:

                                GARY S EMPLOYEE
                Thank you, Mr. Cooper.

                              GARY
                Don t mention it.  Thank you for the 
                great year, Jessica.

  Peter, David and Chloe stand at the end of the line, a little 
  away from everyone else, so they can talk.

                              PETER
                God, he lives for this.

                              DAVID
                He s handing out bonuses and thanking 
                people.  Only you could turn that into 
                  something bad.

                              PETER
                I m not going to thank him.

                              CHLOE
                Ten bucks says you crack.

    Everyone s moved through the line.  Chloe steps up to Gary, 
  who hands her an envelope.

                              CHLOE (CONT'D)
                Thanks, dad.

                              GARY
                Don t mention it, honey.  Great job.

  David steps up, takes his envelope.

                              DAVID
                Thank you, dad.  It s been a great 
                year, and an honor to work with you.

                              GARY
                Don t mention it.  It s an honor to 
                work with you.                                                                                    11.

  Peter steps up.  Gary hands over his envelope.

                              PETER
                All right.

  Peter tries to move on.  Gary s not having it.

                              GARY
                 All right?   No  thank you? 

                              PETER
                I heard you tell everyone not to 
                mention it.

  Gary stares at Peter.  He s not happy.  

                              PETER (V.O.)
                He can t outstare you.  We re not 
                dogs.  It s not like I m going to roll 
                over and pee just because he s-

                              PETER
                Thank you.

                              GARY
                Don t mention it.  Thank you.


  Dana stands awkwardly in Sue s cubicle, while Sue reads.

                              DANA
                So, what is it you do?

                              SUE
                A little of this, a little of that.

  Dana waits for more.  No more is coming.  Dana looks around, 
  sees a manuscript.  Tries to start a conversation:

                              DANA
                Is that Ted Weschler s new novel?  Did 
                you know I published his first story?  
                I mean, how could you, but I thought 
                it was kind of interesting that I knew 
                him when and now here we both are.

  Dana reaches for it - Sue slaps her hand on top of it.

                              SUE
                No touch.

  Dana sighs, leaves the cubicle and heads over to Brian s 
  cubicle.  He s working on his computer.

                              DANA
                Hi.
                      (no answer)
                                (MORE)                                                                                    12.

                              DANA (CONT'D)
                You re not going to tell me what you 
                do, either?  Will you at least tell me 
                why?

                              BRIAN
                We re getting picked off one by one.  
                If anyone cheap knows how to do our 
                job, we re gone.

                              DANA
                That s the last thing I want.

  Brian turns around, puts on headphones.  Dana wanders over to 
  her cubicle:  it s stripped bare, complete with shitty chair.  
  Someone put the empty basket of muffins on her desk.  

  Dana sits.  Picks out a crumb, eats it.  Her cell phone 
  CHIMES, she pulls it out and looks at it.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                 Peter here din 2 night.   How 
                  romantic.  Most great relationships 
                start with spelling with numbers.
                      (starts to reply, pauses)
                If I actually capitalize words and use 
                  punctuation, am I some kind of freak?  
                Just how ignorant am I supposed to 
                sound to be attractive?   Hi Peter 
                food good yes eat?   Screw it, just be 
                simple and to the point.   Sounds 
                  delightful, when and where, Dana.   
                Perfect.  Send.

  Dana hits the button on her phone.  A moment later, we hear 
  Peter s voice:

                              PETER (ON PHONE)
                Hello?

                              DANA
                What?

                              PETER (ON PHONE)
                Hello?  Is this Dana?  It s Peter.

  Dana looks at her phone - what the hell?  Speaks into it:

                              DANA
                Hey.  I was just sending you a text.  

                              PETER (ON PHONE)
                I think you hit the wrong button.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                You think?

                              DANA
                Sorry, I just...  Yes.                                                                                    13.

                              PETER (ON PHONE)
                Yes what?

                              DANA
                Yes, I dinner would like.
                      (then)
                Dinner sounds good.  I m hanging up 
                and sending you the text.

  Dana hangs up.  Puts her head in her hands.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Maybe he ll think that was charming.


  Peter s at his desk, looking confused.  He hangs up his phone 
  as David comes in the office.

                              PETER
                I think the woman you set me up with 
                is insane.

  His phone CHIMES.  He looks at the text.

                              PETER (CONT'D)
                Good speller, though.  
                      (then)
                What do you want?

                              DAVID
                I just wanted to see how big your 
                bonus was.

                              PETER
                What good can come of this?

                              DAVID
                I ll show you mine.

                              PETER
                Never want to hear that sentence from 
                you.

  David holds his check up.  Peter looks.

                              DAVID
                More than you?

                              PETER
                  I haven t even opened mine.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                I can not believe that idiot made more 
                than I did.  I should...  No.  If I 
                make him eat the check, he ll just get 
                another one.                                                                                    14.


  Brian s working at his computer.  He pulls the headphones 
  off, starts packing his stuff in his briefcase.  He turns 
  around; Dana s standing there.

                              BRIAN
                Jesus.

                              DANA
                Just so you know, I m coming back 
                  tomorrow.  And I m bringing more 
                muffins.  I m not some rube.  I ve 
                been the editor of UVA s journal since 
                I got out of school, and we ve won two 
                National Magazine Awards in the last 
                seven years.  That s one more than 
                anyone else has won in the last seven 
                years.  Not to mention-

                              BRIAN
                Okay, fine.  Stop.  I need the new 
                Haas manuscript that just came in so I 
                can read it tonight.  It should be in 
                Craig Spellman s office up one floor.

                              DANA
                On it.

  Dana excitedly starts out.

                              BRIAN
                And take the stairs - we re not 
                supposed to use the elevator for one 
                floor trips.  Save the earth, blah 
                blah blah.


  Dana comes through a heavy metal door marked  40.   She 
  tromps up the metal stairs - not the easiest thing in heels - 
  and gets to a door marked  41.   Pulls it.  It doesn t move.  
  She looks at the sign on the wall:   FIRE EXIT. NO RE-ENTRY. 

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Oh, no.  No, you didn t.

  Dana pulls the door harder.  Nothing.  Pounds on it.  No 
  response.

  She runs back down the stairs - almost slipping in her heels - 
  gets to the door she came in through.  Also locked.  Same 
  sign.  She pounds on this door... no reply.

  Dana walks over to the center of the stairwell, looks down.  
  Forty stories to the ground.  She sighs, starts walking.                                                                                    15.


  Small neighborhood restaurant, local couples out to dinner.  
  Intimate, expensive - not a bad place for a first date.  
  Peter sits alone at a table, glances at his watch.  

  When he looks back up, he notices something outside the 
  window.  With the streetlights outside the dark restaurant, 
  the window in front acts like a mirror to the pedestrians 
  outside.  Dana is standing at the window, checking herself 
  out.  She s staring straight at Peter, but can t see him.

  She s come straight from the office, and she s still a wreck.  
  She fixes her hair, puts on lipstick, bares her teeth to see 
  if she got any on them.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                Oh, poor girl, how embarrassing.

  Dana sniffs her pits.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                I spoke too soon.

  Peter watches as Dana walks over to the door, into the 
    restaurant and to the hostess.  The hostess leads her over to 
  the table; Peter stands to greet her, warm smile on his face.

                              PETER
                You must be Dana.  If my brother had 
                told me what you looked like, I 
                wouldn t have been dreading this so 
                much.

                              DANA
                If I would have known you were so much 
                more charming than your brother, I 
                wouldn t have been dreading this so 
                much.

  They both laugh as they sit down.  Peter grabs a bottle of 
  wine from a bucket near the table.                                                                                    16.

                              PETER
                I hope you don t mind - I went ahead 
                and ordered a bottle.  

                              DANA
                Mind?  After my day, I wish you d 
                ordered two.

  Dana grabs the glass and has a very healthy swig.

                              PETER
                Sorry to hear that.  What happened?

                              DANA
                Don t make me relive it.  Let s talk 
                about you.  David never really 
                  explained what you guys do - something 
                about trophies?

                              PETER
                  Trophies, plaques, vases - if you can 
                engrave your name on it, we make it.

                              DANA
                And how s the trophy business?

                              PETER
                Never been better.  They used to just 
                give  em to winners.  Now everyone 
                gets one.  Fourteenth place champion!  
                Team spirit!  Never missed a practice!  
                Any person engaged in any kind of 
                activity anywhere gets an award.  

                              DANA
                I never thought of it that way.

                              PETER
                It s awesome.  The celebration of 
                  mediocrity is the biggest windfall our 
                company has had in four generations.  
                We can t make trophies fast enough.

  Dana laughs.  Peter s on his game.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                I am so getting laid tonight.  At 
                least a handie in the cab.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                I am so going to forgive him for that 
                text.

  A MAN walks up to their table, sets a card with a cheap 
  bracelet attached to it on their table, walks on and does the 
  same to other tables in the restaurant.

                              DANA
                      (reading card)
                 I am deaf.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                              DANA (CONT'D)
                Any donation you can make for this 
                handmade bracelet would be 
                  appreciated. 

                              PETER
                Just leave it on the table.

                              DANA
                      (reaching for her purse)
                I m going to give him a buck.

                              PETER
                It s a scam.  He s not deaf.

                              DANA
                Oh, come on.  Of course he is.

  The MAN is near Peter, with his back to him.  Peter turns, 
  CLAPS  and WHISTLES as loudly as he can behind him.  The guy 
  doesn t flinch.  

                              DANA (CONT'D)
                Looks like someone s buying a 
                  bracelet.

  The MAN gets to their table, smiles down at Peter and Dana.

                              PETER
                      (to man)
                I will give you twenty dollars to 
                admit you re not deaf, which is more 
                than you re going to clear in this 
                  restaurant.  My offer expires in 
                three, two-

                              MAN
                You are as generous as you are wise.

  Peter hands the guy a twenty; he heads out of the restaurant.  
  Peter turns back to Dana:

                              PETER
                Welcome to New York.

                              DANA
                Just because he s not deaf doesn t 
                mean everyone s not deaf.

                              PETER
                That is the bleakest optimism I ve 
                ever heard.   The next one will be 
                deaf.  I just know it! 

                              DANA
                It s not like I m rooting for people 
                to be deaf, I was just...

                              PETER
                Rooting for that guy to be deaf.                                                                                    18.

                              DANA
                      (laughs)
                Yes.  Thank you.

                              PETER
                Fair enough.
                      (then)
                So how d you meet Amy?

                              DANA
                Freshman year, we were both...

  PETER S POV:

  While Dana talks, Peter gets lost in his thoughts as he looks 
  at her.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                I can t believe David got more than I 
                did.  On what planet did he do a 
                better job?  I guess he didn t 
                  accidentally set the place on fire 
                this year.  
                      (then)
                Wow, great rack.  Don t look.  Just 
                keep it right in your peripheral 
                vision.  This is honestly the best 
                move ever.

  BACK TO SCENE

                              DANA
                So how is working with your family?

                              PETER
                On one hand, you never...

  While Peter s talking, Dana lets her mind wander:

                              DANA (V.O.)
                I can t believe I quit my job and left 
                  everything behind to come work with 
                those idiots.  Who treats people like 
                that?  My calves are still killing me.  
                Who would have thought you could get 
                worn out walking down stairs?  Ugh, I 
                still smell the urine in that 
                  stairwell.  Honestly, who would bother 
                to prop open a door and sneak into the 
                stairs to pee?  How is that easier 
                than using a bathroom?

  Peter s finished talking.  Dana looks at her menu to cover.

                              DANA
                What are y all having?

  Peter chuckles.                                                                                      19.

                              DANA (CONT'D)
                What?

                              PETER
                You were serious.  I m sorry, I never 
                heard someone say  y all  unironically 
                before.  It just... surprised me.

                              DANA
                When I drink I drawl.  It s like my 
                own built in breathalyzer.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Great work.   Y all.   Ask where the 
                outhouse is next.  You re on a roll.

  Another diner drops some silverware - the noise makes Dana 
  turn and look.  She sees something - another woman checking 
  herself in the window.  Just like Dana did.  Fuck...

                              DANA (V.O.)
                No.  No.  He saw me.  Maybe he didn t 
                see me.  No, he saw me.  He s probably 
                just counting the minutes til he can 
                get out of here and go laugh at what a 
                retard I am.  Is there anything I 
                can t screw up?  Work, date...  I m 
                cursed.  This is the worst day ever.
                      (then)
                Did I sniff myself out there?

  Dana winces at the memory.

                              PETER
                You all right?

                              DANA
                Yeah, I just...  Yeah.

  She s not.  She s distracted, looking over at the window...

                              PETER
                So, how are you liking the city?  What 
                have you seen?

                              DANA
                I ve only been here a few days.  The 
                only thing off my list I ve done is go 
                to the Met.

                              PETER
                Your list?

                              DANA
                You re going to think it s dumb.

                              PETER
                No, I m curious.  What s on it?                                                                                    20.

                              DANA
                I don t know off the top of my head.

                              PETER
                So you wrote it down?  Do you have it 
                with you?

                              DANA
                  Probably.

                              PETER
                I d love to see it.  Maybe I can think 
                of something you missed.  

  Dana reaches into her purse, pulls out a piece of paper, 
  hands it to Peter.  It s a two sided, hand written list.

                              PETER (CONT'D)
                Let s take a look here.
                      (as he reads list)
                Number one, Statue of Liberty.  I 
                guess you gotta go.  High Line Park, a 
                little boring, but you know what?  Go 
                to number seven, get drunk, then it ll 
                be more fun.  Let s see...  rip off, 
                rip off, full of German tourists with 
                socks and sandals...  This one s good.  
                You should probably bring a gun, 
                though.  Do you have a pen?  I ve got 
                some ideas for you.

  Peter looks up at Dana.  A single tear runs down her cheek.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                Abort!  Joke gone awry, damage control-

                              PETER
                I was just trying to be funny, this is 
                a great list-

                              DANA
                It s not you, I just had a horrible 
                day at work-

                              PETER
                Work.  You never even told me what you 
                did, let s talk about that.

  That does it.  Dana breaks out in tears.

                                PETER/DANA (V.O.)
                Holy shit! 

                              PETER
                I m so sorry - I really wasn t trying 
                to upset you-

                              DANA (V.O.)
                I cannot believe I am crying on a 
                first date.  Happy thoughts.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    21.

                              DANA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Getting your first bike when you were 
                nine.  Winning the spelling bee.  
                First orgasm you didn t give yourself.

                              PETER
                Was it because I brought up work?

                              DANA
                      (sobs harder)
                Can you please stop saying  work? 

                              PETER
                Is that what made you cry?

                              DANA
                Can you please stop saying  cry? 

  Dana looks around - all the other tables are staring at their 
  table.  It s a mix of sympathetic looks at Dana and withering 
  looks at Peter.  Peter tries to explain himself:

                              PETER
                We just met.  I think it s about work - 
                sorry, didn t mean to say that.  

  Dana hiccups between sobs.  Not a pretty sound. 

                              PETER (CONT'D)
                What was that?

                              DANA
                When I cry I hiccup.  You know what?  
                I m just gonna go before I throw up.

                              PETER
                Okay, well, can I-

                              DANA
                Stay!

  Dana jumps up and runs out of the restaurant, crying and 
  hiccuping and retching.  Everyone watches her leave, then 
  everyone turns back to glare at Peter.

  Peter sticks his arms up in the air.

                              PETER
                New record!

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    22.

                                        ACT TWO


  Peter s at his desk - his phone rings and he grabs it.

                                                                      INTERCUT WITH:


  Amy s in yoga gear, doing an impossible pose while she talks.

                              AMY
                What the hell did you do last night?

                              PETER
                I don t know!  Is she all right?

                              AMY
                She will be when you fix it.

                              PETER
                I asked her about her day and she had 
                  a nervous breakdown.  This one isn t 
                fixable.

                              AMY
                She s part of my life.  You re part of 
                my life.  There s no way I m going to 
                let this ugliness invade every get 
                together I have.  To be honest, you 
                probably should have said  no  to the 
                date in the first place.  But you 
                didn t, and here we are.  Fix it.

  ON AMY, who hangs up.  Says to someone off screen in her 
  living room:

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                And into feathered peacock.

  Amy shifts positions, and we widen to see that she s not just 
  doing yoga, she s teaching a class in her apartment.

  ON PETER, who tries to get back to work.  David walks in.

                              DAVID
                Sounds like it went great last night.

                              PETER
                Yeah, set me up again soon.

                              DAVID
                You get a chance to look at your 
                check?

                              PETER
                David, there s a reason we don t share 
                things like bonuses and salary.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    23.

                              PETER (CONT'D)
                It hurts feelings, it makes people 
                mad, it s just a bad idea.

                              DAVID
                It s that much less.  Wow.

                              PETER
                Five hundred dollars.  It was five 
                hundred less than you.  Happy?

                              DAVID
                Only five hundred?  I should have made 
                twice what you did.  I killed it this 
                year.  Ignore everything else, I 
                landed the Jenkins account, which 
                  basically saved us.

                              PETER
                I landed the Jenkins account after you 
                almost blew it taking their daughter 
                to lunch in a strip club!

                              DAVID
                  I thought she was a guy!

                              PETER
                Which you kept saying, loudly and 
                often!
                      (gathers himself)
                See?  This is exactly why we don t do 
                this.  Congratulations.  You won.  Now 
                can we please stop talking about this?

                              DAVID
                There was just nothing feminine about 
                her at all.  And that haircut.

                              PETER
                Go!


  Dana s waiting for the elevator, with a fresh basket of 
  muffins.  Eric joins her as it arrives; they step in.


  Eric helps himself to a muffin.  His half of the conversation 
  is through a mouth full of muffin:

                              ERIC
                  Delicious.  How s it going?

                              DANA
                  Honestly?  It s a disaster.  They 
                won t even talk to me.

                              ERIC
                Don t give up.                                                                                      24.

                              DANA
                That s easy for you to say, but you 
                didn t see what they-

                              ERIC
                The woman I interviewed for this job 
                wasn t a quitter.  She was coming to 
                New York to take over the city.  That 
                same passion you showed me?  You show 
                it to them, and they ll love you.

  The elevator gets to their floor.  Eric grabs as many muffins 
  as he can, heads out.


  Peter s with Chloe.

                              CHLOE
                ...did she actually vomit?

                              PETER
                Not in the restaurant.  She was 
                getting kind of urpy as she got to the 
                door, though.
                      (then)
                It was going great.  She was cute, 
                seemed nice, we were laughing...  And 
                then she just lost it.  
                      (off Chloe s look)
                I did nothing wrong.

                              CHLOE
                You sure you didn t go too far when 
                you were doing that thing where you re 
                all glib and jokey to get her to laugh 
                and get her into bed?

                              PETER
                  Absolutely not.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                That s a  thing?   I thought that was 
                my personality.  

                              CHLOE
                She left the restaurant sobbing after 
                five minutes.  You might want to look 
                inward.

                              PETER
                If I promise to look inward, will you 
                help me fix it?

                              CHLOE
                Show up with flowers, apologize, say 
                it was one hundred percent your fault, 
                even though you re sure it wasn t.                                                                                    25.

                              PETER
                It wasn t.

                              CHLOE
                No jokes, and don t do that thing 
                where you check out her cleavage while 
                you stare into her eyes.  It looks 
                like you have Graves disease.  

  Chloe bugs out her eyes to demonstrate.

                              PETER
                I have no idea what you re talking 
                about.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                Get out of my soul, witch.


  Brian and Sue are silently eating.  Dana enters, takes a 
  breath, get her courage up...

                              DANA
                Good morning.  I ve got a few things 
                to say, and I hope you ll hear me out.    
                First off, after you sent me down the 
                  stairwell-

  Brian and Sue fist bump.

                              DANA (CONT'D)
                -I went back up, got the manuscript, 
                and copy edited the whole thing last 
                night.  I had some time, the night 
                didn t really turn out how I was... 
                anyway, here.

  Dana pulls out a manuscript, drops it on the table.

                              DANA (CONT'D)
                The thing is, I love publishing.  I 
                didn t romanticize Hemingway and 
                  Fitzgerald, I romanticized their 
                editor, Maxwell Perkins.  I left 
                  everything behind to move to New York 
                to chase my dream.  You two are living 
                  connections to the business I love.  
                Now, I know the industry is going 
                through some tough times.  But maybe 
                we should take Eric at his word.  He 
                hired me.  Maybe that is a good sign.

  Brian and Sue take it in, think it over...

                              BRIAN
                You ve got a poppy seed in your teeth.

  Dana sighs, pulls out a compact, starts picking the seed out.  
  Brian and Sue exchange a look.                                                                                    26.

                              SUE
                You promise you re not after our jobs?

                              DANA
                I swear.  I just want to help.  

                              SUE
                Okay.  I ll show you around.

                              BRIAN
                Yeah, fine.  Me, too.

                              DANA
                Oh my god, I can t believe that 
                worked.  Thank you.  Thank you!

  Dana goes around the table for a hug - Brian and Sue both 
  shake their heads.  Dana shakes their hands instead.


  Peter looks up from his desk, sighs.  David s coming.

                              PETER
                What?

                              DAVID
                This bonus thing has me thinking.

                              PETER
                Stop.

                              DAVID
                Either my bonus was bigger because I 
                make more, and it reflects that-

                              PETER
                I m sure that s what it is.  Goodbye.  

                              DAVID
                Or dad s making it up to me because 
                you make more.

                              PETER
                Why do you care?  Amy s loaded.  I 
                could make twice what you do, and you 
                could still buy and sell me.

  David pulls out a paystub, holds it up.

                              DAVID
                Higher or lower?  I don t need a 
                number.

  Peter looks away.  David keeps moving the check so it s in 
  his face.  Finally Peter looks.                                                                                    27.

                              PETER
                That s super, David.  You make more 
                than I do, you ve earned it, you re 
                the champ.

                              DAVID
                No hard feelings, you do a great job, 
                too.  Thank you.
                      (then)
                I don t believe you.  What s your 
                number?


  Dana comes in the front door from work; Amy s in the living 
  room, playing guitar.  She stops playing and gives Dana an 
    incredibly pitying look.

                              AMY
                How d work go?

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Oh, the pitying eyes.  My favorite.  
                Well, I hate to let you down, but...

                              DANA
                It went great!  I totally won everyone 
                over, welcomed with opened arms, we 
                swapped war stories all day...  

                              AMY
                Wow, congrats.

                              DANA
                Thanks.  I m going to grab something 
                to drink - can I get you something?

                              AMY
                I m good.

  Dana walks into the kitchen and finds...


  Dana walks into the kitchen to find David standing there, 
  shaking a cocktail shaker.

                              DAVID
                Did I hear  drinks?   Just mixing up 
                some appletinis.  

                              DANA
                  I haven t had one of those since 
                college.

                              DAVID
                I think Amy mentioned that you guys 
                used to drink them.  Back in the room.                                                                                    28.

  David pours a huge glass for Dana; she takes it and sips it.  
  Coughs like she just drank fire.

                              DANA
                Where s the apple?  It s all tini.

                              DAVID
                There s a splash.

                              DANA
                One of these, I ll be on my ass.

                              DAVID
                We wouldn t want that.

  Amy comes into the kitchen, smiling at Dana.

                              AMY
                It is someone s lucky day.  There s a 
                very remorseful man at the door 
                holding a very large bouquet of 
                flowers, and he wants to talk to you.

                              DANA
                Who, Peter?  Not interested.

                              AMY
                Wouldn t the mature thing be to go out 
                there like an adult and talk to him?

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Don t wanna.

  Dana trudges out of the kitchen.  Amy and David follow.


  As promised, Peter is standing just inside the door with an 
  obscene bouquet of flowers.  He hands them over.

                              PETER
                Hey, Dana.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                She is hot when she s not sobbing.

                              DANA
                Peter.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                You can bring a whole florist and it s 
                not going to make me forget about...  
                Ooh, lilies.

                              PETER
                I ve been going over it in my mind all 
                day.  I was a jerk, and there is no 
                excuse for my behavior.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    29.

                              PETER (CONT'D)
                Is there any way we can wipe the slate 
                clean, start over?  I promise you, I m 
                not a horrible person, and I d really 
                love a chance to get to know you 
                better.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                I did nothing wrong.

                              DANA
                I don t think you re horrible...  
                Listen, I d had the worst day of my 
                life, I was a wreck, and I think you 
                just caught a lot of it.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                Okay, that s pretty cool of her.

                              PETER
                You wanna grab dinner, try again?

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Might have let him off too easy.  Eh, 
                I ll torture him later.

                              DANA
                Sure.  Only if we go to a different 
                  restaurant.

                              PETER
                Oh, they re never letting us back in 
                there.

  Dana laughs.  Peter s making a nice recovery.

                              DANA
                Let me grab a jacket.

  Dana heads into her bedroom.  The second she s gone, Peter 
  turns to Amy.

                              PETER
                That seemed to go well.  I m glad you 
                made me come back.

  Amy tries to motion for Peter to be quiet - too late.  She 
  gestures - Peter turns and sees that Dana came right back out 
  of the bedroom.  Shit.

                              DANA
                Made you?  And for a second, I thought 
                you wanted to.  How stupid of me.

                              PETER
                No, wait.  I m going to be honest - I 
                didn t want to, but after I got here 
                and I apologized and you apologized... 
                I was glad I did.                                                                                    30.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                Did that fix it?

  Dana throws the flowers back at Peter, heads into her bedroom 
  and slams the door.

                              AMY
                You men are such idiots.

  She follows Dana into her room.  David turns to Peter.

                              DAVID
                I was two appletinis away from filming 
                those two going to town on that very 
                rug you re standing on.  Thanks for 
                stopping by.

  David holds the door open for Peter, who heads out.


  Dana walks in, and it s a very different experience than her 
  first day:  people greet her by name, smile, wave...

  As she s heading towards her cubicle, something catches her 
  eye - Eric, peeking out of his office.  He waves her over.


  Dana comes in; Eric closes the door.

                              ERIC
                Seems like you won them over.

                              DANA
                I did just what you said.  I showed 
                them my passion, let them know I 
                didn t want their jobs.

                              ERIC
                About that.

                              DANA
                About what?

                              ERIC
                If there s another round of layoffs, 
                they re the next two up.

                              DANA
                But I told them...  When s this going 
                to happen?

                              ERIC
                Maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe 
                never.  Stay close, keep learning, so 
                you re ready to jump in when it 
                happens.  Whoops, if it happens.                                                                                    31.

                              DANA
                I can t-

                              ERIC
                Hey, look on the bright side.  Think 
                what a great position you re going to 
                be in when things turn around.  Pretty 
                soon you ll be firing me and taking my 
                job.  Ha ha.

  Eric opens the door to his office.  Dana staggers out.


  Dana walks into the bullpen.  The first face she sees is Sue.  
  Dana inadvertently lets out a frightened YELP.

                              SUE
                There she is.  Our little Southern ray 
                of sunshine.  How you doing today?

                              DANA (V.O.)
                I am death, come to destroy you all.


  Peter sticks his head in David s office as he walks by.

                              PETER
                Dad s gone, you can stop pretending to 
                work...  Hey.  Where d you get that?

  Peter enters, grabs a piece of paper up off David s desk.  
  It s Dana s list.

                              DAVID
                It was in your jacket pocket.

                              PETER
                What were you doing in my jacket?

                              DAVID
                Looking for your paycheck.

                              PETER
                This has got to stop.  You can t go 
                though my stuff.

                              DAVID
                Oh, boo hoo.
                      (re list)
                That list surprised me.  I thought you 
                were too cynical for those things.

                              PETER
                It s Dana s, she left-  What do you 
                mean, too cynical?                                                                                    32.

                              DAVID
                It means you ve got to maintain your 
                hip ironic distance.  Can t admit that 
                you actually enjoy anything.

                              PETER
                I enjoy plenty of things.  That list 
                is a little lame, don t you think?  
                Central Park.  Statue of Liberty.

                              DAVID
                      (grabs it back, reads)
                 Be the first person at the Public 
                Library when they open and read until 
                a guard kicks you out...  Spend a 
                night in the same room at the Hotel 
                Chelsea that Thomas Wolfe did...  Sit 
                on the bench that Woody Allen and 
                Diane Keaton sat on in  Manhattan  and 
                watch the sun come up over the 
                  Queensboro bridge... 
                      (then)
                These are great.

                              PETER
                No, they re not.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                They re so great.

                              DAVID
                So what d you do when she gave it to 
                you?  Make fun of it?

                              PETER
                What do you think I am?

                              DAVID
                I think you re an asshole.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                God, he s right.  I m an asshole.

  David may have nailed Peter, but it doesn t mean Peter isn t 
  leaving without one small victory:

                              PETER
                By the way, I always keep my paycheck 
                with me, just so you don t find it.  
                Here.  

  Peter pulls his paystub out of his pocket, throws it on 
  David s desk.

                              PETER (CONT'D)
                Have a good night, David.

  Peter walks out into the bullpen.  From behind him, we hear:                                                                                    33.

                              DAVID (O.S.)
                God damn it!

  Peter smiles.


  The sun s just breaking through the window.  Dana s sitting 
  in bed, laptop in lap.  There s a knock at the door.

                              DANA
                I don t want a mimosa, David.

  The door opens; Amy enters.

                              AMY
                You should look outside, and I swear, 
                I had nothing to do with this.

  Dana shakes her head - what now?


  Dana s in bed on her computer.  She enters some text, then 
  Amy calls in from the other room:

                              AMY (O.S.)
                Why did you just change your 
                  relationship status?

                              DANA
                I didn t have anything set.  I made it 
                   single. 

                              AMY (O.S.)
                Why?

                              DANA
                I had a good time with Peter, I just 
                wanted him to know that I wasn t in 
                another relationship. 

                              AMY (O.S.)
                Are you crazy?  You had a good date 
                and you changed it to single?  It s 
                like saying,  just to be clear, this 
                isn t going anywhere. 

  Dana changes it.

                              AMY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                 In a relationship?   Are you insane?  
                After one date?

  Dana changes it again.

                              AMY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  Seriously?


  Peter s at the table with his laptop, bottle of beer in hand.  
  He s watching the screen - it s Dana s profile.  It keeps 
  getting updated:   Single.    In a relationship.    It s 
    complicated.    Removed relationship status.    Single.   
     Widowed. 

  Peter sips his beer and shakes his head as we...

                                                                            FADE OUT.

                                      END OF SHOW
