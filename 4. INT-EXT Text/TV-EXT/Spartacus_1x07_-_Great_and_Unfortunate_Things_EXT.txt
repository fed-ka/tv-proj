  Spartacus carries Sura s shrouded body towards a pyre in the 
  center of the square. VARRO stands beside it with a torch. 
  DOCTORE and the GLADIATORS ring the square. BATIATUS, 
  LUCRETIA, and NAEVIA watch from the balcony.

  SPARTACUS

  gently places Sura s body onto the pyre. Varro solemnly 
  hands him the torch. Spartacus gazes at his wife for one 
  last anguished moment. He lights the pyre.

  DOCTORE

  stands stoically at the edge of the square. Despite his 
  sympathy, he has not forgotten Spartacus  betrayal of 
  drugging his wine (from episode 106).

  PIETROS

  stares sadly at the flames. His heart heavy with loss now 
  that Barca is gone.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.

  GNAEUS

  glances at Pietros, a hungry look filling his eyes.

  ASHUR

  chews seeds as he looks on from the shadows.

  BATIATUS AND LUCRETIA

  gaze down from the balcony. Lucretia glances at her husband, 
  privy to the secret that Sura s blood stains his hands. But 
  his attention never strays from the pyre, his eyes 
  unreadable as the light from the flames plays across his 
  face.

  BACK TO SPARTACUS,

  his eyes full of tears. His wife, his reason for living -- 
  gone. SLOW PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS as the flames rise, 
  consuming his heart...



  Spartacus stands at the cliff, looking out across the hills 
  with heavy heart. Behind him the MEN assemble for the day s 
  training.

  VARRO

  eyes Spartacus from across the square, deeply affected by 
  his friend s loss. Ashur limps past.

                                        VARRO
                        Ashur? A word.

                                        ASHUR
                        Couple it with coin and make it a 
                        sentence.

                                        VARRO
                        I would see a message delivered to 
                      my wife.

  Ashur glances at Spartacus.

                                        ASHUR
                        The Thracian s loss stirs you to 
                        letters. Ten sesterci will see it 
                        placed in her hands.

                                        VARRO
                        Ten?

                                        ASHUR
                        Five would also see it along. 
                        Eventually.

  Varro frowns in acceptance. ACROSS THE SQUARE, Pietros 
  hustles up to Spartacus with twin practice swords.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    13.

                        Your swords for practice, Champion.

  Spartacus takes them, pauses as he sees Pietros now sports a 
  bruised cheek and a busted lip. Pietros looks away in shame. 
  Doctore breaks the moment with a crack of his whip.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The day s training begins. Pair up!

  Pietros hustles off the sand as men move to comply. Varro 
  heads for Spartacus.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Spartacus! I am your man.
                                to Pietros)(
                        Sword and shield!

  The men register that with interest. Varro shoots Spartacus 
  a worried look. Pietros hands Doctore a practice sword and 
  shield. Doctore locks eyes with Spartacus as he moves into 
  position.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                                  sincerely)(
                        Your wife s passing. It was an 
                        unfortunate thing.

  Spartacus nods, too filled with the grief of it to respond.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                      As was your plan for escape.

  Doctore attacks, the brutality of the assault driving 
  Spartacus back. Varro and the men can t help but glance over 
  during their own sparring. Spartacus recovers. The two men 
  circle each other, eyes burning, voices harsh whispers.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        I have not tasted wine for many 
                        years. Yet a single cup would not 
                        rob me of my senses.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The choice was to see you sleep... 
                      Or never awaken.

  Doctore attacks. Blows are traded, each man drawing blood. 
  They part, circling. Doctore wipes blood from his lip.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Your victory over Theokoles... The 
                        peace it brought my heart... It is

                        the only reason Batiatus does not 
                        know of your treachery. Champion or 
                        no, you would be crucified.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Then part lips and see it done!

  Spartacus attacks, rage flashing across his anguished face. 
  The two men exchange thunderous blows.  They end up in a 
  stalemate, their swords both raised to crack each other's 
  skull.  A frozen beat.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Next time you seek escape... You 
                        had best kill me.

  Doctore turns his back on Spartacus and walks away.  OFF 
  Spartacus, his rage draining away, replaced by crushing 
  grief... and regret that he was forced to betray Doctore...



  Gnaeus spars with Rhaskos. He knocks Rhaskos to the ground, 
  the prongs of his practice trident pointed at Rhaskos  face.

                                          SPARTACUS (O.S.)
                        Gnaeus!

  Gnaeus turns just as Spartacus slams into him. TIME SLOWS as 
  the two smash to the ground. Spartacus unleashes on the 
  stunned Gnaeus, his fists raining down.

  THE MEN

  laugh and cheer, delighted by the unexpected violence. 
  Varro, having followed Spartacus, frowns nervously.

  GNAEUS

  shoves Spartacus off and scrambles to his feet. Spartacus 
  attacks, his eyes wild with rage. TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES 
  as the two men trade vicious blows. BLOOD SPLATTERS in 
  glorious slow motion.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

  SPARTACUS DRIVES GNAEUS BACK,

  coming dangerously close to the edge of the cliff. He rears 
  back to finish him off. THE CRACK OF A WHIP stops him.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Enough!

  Doctore strides up, coiling his whip. The square goes quiet. 
  Doctore s blazing eyes fall on the two offenders.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        What is this foolishness?

                        Pietros. The boy has taken his own 
                        life.

  Doctore frowns at the news. Gnaeus appears to take the news 
  hard.

                                        GNAEUS
                      He will be missed.
                                (a fuck you to 
                                  Spartacus)
                        Especially his lips around my cock.

  TIGHT ON SPARTACUS as the world GOES RED behind him with 
  rage. He swings with all his might, launching a fist at 
  Gnaeus. TIME SLOWS as it connects with Gnaeus  jaw, lifting 
  the man off his feet and sending him SAILING OVER THE CLIFF 
  to the jagged rocks below.  Stunned silence.  Doctore glares 
  at Spartacus.  OFF his smoldering wrath...



  ADJUST off the dying campfire to find a makeshift lean-to. 
  The Thracian (Spartacus) curled with Sura, post-coital. 
  [NOTE: This is the same location as in ep 101, scene 14. 
  After Spartacus rescued Sura from the Barbarians, but before 
  being captured by the Romans.]

                        Why?

  A beat as she considers the question.

                                        SURA
                        Our village is gone.  Everyone we 
                        held close, dead.  If there are no 
                        gods... if there is nothing to 
                        shape what happens in our lives... 
                        Then there is no meaning to any of 
                        it.

  The Thracian absorbs this, troubled.

  She nestles in close, sleep beckoning as she closes her 
  eyes. OFF The Thracian, still troubled, his own eyes 
  remaining open...



  The crowd BOOS as the six PRISONERS are led onto the arena s 
  sand. Each dressed as a Thracian soldier, the men s 
  appearance almost identical to that of Drenis and the others 
  Spartacus fought alongside in the auxiliary in 101.

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus steps onto a podium and raises his hands for an 
    announcement. Mercato, Lucretia, and Ilithyia behind him.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Citizens of Capua! Today, we honor 
                        the noble Marcus Minucius Rufus. A 
                        Roman consul and commander 
                        unmatched in glory. As tribute,

                        enact his grandfather s most famous 
                        battle against the Thracian hordes!

  The crowd CHEERS and Mercato stands and tosses a one-handed 
  salute to his adoring public. Batiatus lets him have his 
  moment, then launches into the story of the re-enactment.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Gaze at the prisoners standing 
                        before you. And imagine the 
                        Thracian Maedi that invaded 
                        Macedonia. Raping and pillaging its 
                        noble people. Murdering all in 
                        their path... even a Roman 
                        governor!

  ARENA

  The Prisoners react as the crowd BOOS and throws assorted 
  garbage in their direction.

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus continues his oration, working the crowd, building

                        their backs. All seemed lost, until 
                        Rome dispatched her favored son...
                                  dramatic pause)(
                        Enter Marcus Minucius Rufus!

  ARENA

  The gates open and Spartacus marches out. An impressive 
  sight. The picture of the Roman Legion s finest.

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus has set up the event, now he shifts gears to hype 
  his own goods.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        For the honorable role of Rufus, 
                        there was but one choice. The 
                        Bringer of Rain! Slayer of 
                        Theokoles! And Champion of Capua... 
                        I present to you -- Spartacus!!!

  The crowd goes totally Thunderdome at this announcement. 
  CHANTS of  Spartacus! Spartacus!  reverberate. Ilithyia 
  glowers.

                                        ILITHYIA
                                to Mercato)(
                        I thought it was your grandfather 
                      we honor. Yet the crowd chants 
                         Spartacus .

  Mercato frowns, dissatisfied. Batiatus sweeps in, smoothing 
  the waters.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Worry not of details, good Mercato. 
                        The glory remains your 
                          grandfather s alone. Come! Give the 
                        signal to begin his glorious 
                        victory!

  Batiatus steps aside. Lucretia gives him an appreciative 
  grin -- nicely played. Mercato moves to the edge of the 
  pulvinus, beaming with pride.

                                          MERCATO
                      In honor of Marcus Minucius 
                        Rufus... Let blood be shed!

  THE ARENA

  The crowd ROARS as the Prisoners fan out to attack.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

  SPARTACUS

  remains motionless, paying them no attention.  TIME SLOWS as 
  he turns his head slightly upward to consider the clouds and 
  the heavens.

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus' face slips into absent worry.  This is not what he 
  expected.

  ARENA

  A sad smile bends Spartacus' lips as feels the sun on his 
  face, the gentle breeze... and closes his eyes, putting his 
  fate in the hands of the gods.

  PRISONER #1

  steps forward and HURLS HIS SPEAR at Spartacus.  It soars 
  through the air -- and CATCHES THE BREEZE, altering its 
  course just enough to miss slamming into Spartacus' face. 
  The gleaming tip draws a thin line across Spartacus' cheek. 
  TIME RESUMES as

  SPARTACUS' EYES CRASH OPEN

  and hell is unleashed.  Spartacus attacks.  PRISONER #2 
  thrusts his sword at Spartacus' neck, but Spartacus deflects 
  it, just in time to sidestep PRISONER #3's assault.  As the 
  Prisoner's sword swings through air

  SPARTACUS

  slices the man's right arm, PRISONER #3 screaming in pain as 
  his blood SPRAYS onto the sand.  Spartacus has no time to 
  react as PRISONER #4's sword carves a giant gash across his 
  shoulder blades.

  PRISONER #2

  sees an opening and advances.  Spartacus and Prisoner #2 get 
  tangled up, but before the others can descend, Spartacus 
  slams an elbow into the man's throat.  Prisoner #2 hits the 
  sand and Spartacus spins around just in time to see PRISONER 
  #5's

  BATTLE AXE

  spinning toward his head.  TIME SLOWS as Spartacus bends out 
  of the way, the axe rotating lazily an inch from his face. 
  Spartacus needs to get to open space.  He barrels towards 
  PRISONER #4, smashing the man's helmet.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

  PULVINUS

  Mercato bolts from his seat, thrilled by the hit.  Batiatus 
  laughs and swills wine.  Lucretia eyes the action with 
  wonder.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He moves as a man possessed.

                                        BATIATUS
                      By the gods themselves.

  ARENA

  Prisoner #1, having retrieved his spear, attacks.  Spartacus 
  counters.  Prisoner #1 swings the base of the spear, 
  catching Spartacus across the jaw.  Spartacus staggers back, 
  momentarily stunned.

  THE PRISONERS REGROUP

  stalking towards him.  Each prisoner with but one mission -- 
  kill Spartacus.  Spartacus eyes them, breathing hard, 
  feeling the odds closing in against him.

  PULVINUS

  A hush has fallen over the arena.  Scattered MURMURS.  The 
  crowd concerned that their champion may not survive this 
  battle.  Mercato sits panicked as he turns to Batiatus.

                                          MERCATO
                        You do realize my grandfather won 
                        this battle?

  Ilithyia is unable to suppress a satisfied smile.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Perhaps this day history will not 
                        repeat itself.

  ARENA

  Spartacus surveys the Prisoners in front of him.  His face 
  hardens with new resolve.  If this is his destiny, let it 
  begin now.

  SPARTACUS SPRINTS FORWARD,

  a sword gripped tightly in each hand.  With his right sword, 
  he stabs Prisoner #2 through the throat.  Spartacus releases 
  the sword's grip and ducks just as


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.
  CONTINUED:

  PRISONER #4

  swings his sword at Spartacus' neck.  From the sand, 
  Spartacus clutches his remaining sword with both hands and 
  thrusts it upward, skewering Prisoner #4, who vomits RIBBONS 
  OF BLOOD on Spartacus and the sand below. SPARTACUS RISES

  and removes his sword from Prisoner #2's lifeless neck.  He 
  then turns and hurls his other sword at Prisoner #5, the 
  blade lodging deep inside the man's skull.  Three down, 
  three to go.

  PULVINUS

  The crowd is in a fervor.  Mercato rises from his seat, the 
  thrill and excitement almost too much for him.  Batiatus 
  leans forward, eager.  His eyes alive with purpose.

  THE ARENA

  Prisoner #3 and PRISONER #1 attempt to work as a team, 
  circling Spartacus.  Finally, the two rush from opposite 
  sides.  Spartacus runs his sword through Prisoner #3's 
  stomach as Prisoner #1 thrusts his spear at Spartacus' neck.

  TIME SLOWS

  as Spartacus leans back, the spear's tip narrowly avoiding 
  his chin.  TIME RESUMES.  With his right hand, Spartacus 
  grabs the spear's shaft and yanks it out of the Prisoner's 
  hand.  He breaks the spear in two across his knee and then

  STABS THE POINTED TIP

  through Prisoner #1's right ear, the spear, and some brains, 
  exiting his left.  The Prisoner's eyes roll back in his 
  empty head as Spartacus turns and looks for the last 
  prisoner.

  PRISONER #6 FLEES

  to the opposite side of the arena.  Looking for a miracle, 
  some sort of way out.  He grabs the chute's gate and shakes 
  it... but it's no use.  He's trapped.  The man turns to face

  SPARTACUS,

  stalking over, both swords dripping blood onto the sand. A 
  Roman killing machine. Realizing there s nowhere to flee,





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.
  CONTINUED:

  PRISONER #6

  sprints towards Spartacus, both hands holding his sword 
  above his head.  Prisoner #6 brings it down with all his 
  might... but Spartacus easily deflects it.  Prisoner #6 
  loses the sword's handle and is sent crashing to his knees. 
  SPARTACUS  SHADOW descends over the fallen Prisoner.  ON 
  SPARTACUS, as he raises his sword, set to deliver the final 
  blow, only to pause when he sees

  HIS OWN FACE

  staring up at him from the sand. Not Spartacus as he appears 
  now, but as he did when he was a Thracian. Long hair and 
  beard, face bloodied from battle with Solonius  men (from ep 
  101). The Thracian Spartacus locks eyes with Spartacus. A 
  frozen moment.

  TIGHT ON SPARTACUS,

  as Batiatus  words echo in his head. Knowing that to kill 
  this man is to kill his Thracian past. Thracian Spartacus 
  looks up with pleading eyes and utters but one word:

                                        THRACIAN SPARTACUS
                        Don t...

  SPARTACUS SNARLS

  as he brings his sword down with violent fury, decapitating 
  the defenseless Prisoner. Blood erupts from the Prisoner s 
  neck like a scarlet volcano as his head (not Thracian 
  Spartacus ) tumbles to the sand.

  PULVINUS

  The crowd ROARS. Mercato beams. Ilithyia frowns, 
    disappointed yet again.

                                          MERCATO
                        A marvelous show!

                                        BATIATUS
                      An honor to be of service.

  Batiatus glows. Lucretia basks in the warmth of it.

  ARENA

  Spartacus stands exhausted and blood-soaked, absorbing the 
  public s deafening CHEERS. His eyes are hard, but there s a 
  certainty there. He is a man who s accepted his fate. He 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

  throws his arms up to the heavens and shouts for all the 
  world to hear --

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I... AM... SPARTACUS!!!

  The crowd ROARS.

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus grins in triumph. Spartacus is now truly his.

  ARENA

  OFF Spartacus, embracing the will of the gods...


  BLACKOUT.
