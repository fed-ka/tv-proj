          JOHNNY SMITH

          taking in the idyllic setting, it seems like a perfect
          Saturday morning... suddenly a hand reaches up toward him
          from --

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA (O.S.)
                        Heed the still, small voice when

          ANGLE - A FILTHY HOMELESS WOMAN IN TATTERS

          sitting on the sidewalk... revealing her to be VERA SMITH,
          Johnny's mother...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mom...?  You're alive...?

          As her hand touches his arm... she looks into his eyes...
          repeating, urgently, just to him --

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA
                        Heed the still, small voice when
                        it comes.

          Johnny looks at her, confused, not understanding what she
          means.  But his mother's living on the street and it's
            humiliating... he reaches down to help her up...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Get, get up off the street, why
                        are you... 

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA
                                (urgent)
                        It came to Jeremiah and Daniel
                        and Amos and Abraham.  It'll come
                        to you.  And when it does, do
                        your duty.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What... what are you doing here? 
                        They told me you were...

          She is up now, calling out for the world to hear about
          her son --

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA
                        His work is great upon the earth!

          Johnny follows her, trying to get her to be quiet...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mom... ssshhhhshhh... stop...

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA
                        Praise the lord: we are saved!

          And this is completely embarrassing now... as Johnny looks
          around to see --

            REACTIONS AROUND THE SQUARE

          And this all happens very very fast: a rugged MAN#1 in a
          funny cap loading some lumber into the back of a truck
          turns to the voice... a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN#1 saying a
          cheerful good-bye to a SHOP-KEEPER both look to see what's
          going on... a couple of OLDER FELLOWS playing checkers
          outside the barber shop get out of their chair and move
          toward the sound...

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA (CONT'D)
                        His work is great upon the earth!

          A YOUNG COUPLE sharing a hot fudge sundae outside the ice

          JOHNNY

          grabs his mother and tries to end this...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, that... that's enough, ma...

          But as he grabs her and turns her to him... he recoils as
          he sees --


          HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA - HER EYES ARE BLACK

          and lifeless...

          it's like they've just spotted a rock star in their town...

          "Johnny... Johnny... touch us, Johnny" follows him as
          they chase him...


          DOWN THE SIDEWALK - MOVING WITH JOHNNY

          where more people are coming at him... coming out of
          buildings, out doors... people surrounding him are tugging
          at him, each touch is like an electric shock, his clothes
          are being torn... it's a bloody riot right here in Cleaves
          Mills... and all the while there is this wall of sound...
          "Johnny... Johnny... Johnny... touch us, Johnny..."

                                        JOHNNY
                        No... stop... please don't touch

          And as it seems he's going to drown in hands...



          A couple of lovely shots in winter (without snow)...





          A reluctant Johnny coming out of the house with BRUCE
          moving toward Bruce's P-T Cruiser in the driveway.  Mid-
            conversation, fast, overlapping dialogue:

                                        JOHNNY
                        You should've asked me before
                        you...

                                        BRUCE
                        ...sure and you would have told
                        me...

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...don't you think it's a little
                        too soon to be...

                                        BRUCE
                        ... living again? 
                                (beat)
                        Time to get back on the horse,
                        John.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm just not sure I'm ready to
                        walk back into that school...

                                        BRUCE
                        Why?  Because you're afraid people
                        are gonna touch you?  You know
                        what -- they will.  And you're
                        gonna have to deal.  Part of the
                          re-entry process.

          Johnny looks phobic.  But Bruce is full of confidence in
          him, smiles encouragingly.

                                        BRUCE
                        You've got to learn how to be the
                        hero of your own life again, John. 
                        But until you're ready, I'll be
                        the hero of your life... in return
                        for a stock market tip now and
                        then.  Get in the car.

          As they reach the car, Johnny takes a deep breath,
            gathering courage.  He looks at Bruce and nods okay, let's
          do it.   

                                        JOHNNY

                        especially those who've been in a

          Johnny opens the driver's door, ready to take the wheel...

          they get in --

                                        BRUCE
                        I mean if you were going to have
                        an accident, you'd know it before
                        it ever happened... In time to

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Hey, doc...!

          Cooper looks to see Johnny moving quickly toward him from
          the school...

                        Can I talk to you a sec about
                        Todd Paley.  I've asked him to
                        come by and see you.

                        Well, yeah but... has he ever had
                        any other health problems?

                        Just the usual aches and pains...
                        Todd plays hard.  Why?  

          Johnny takes a long beat, there's no easy way so he gets
          to the point.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Never any... heart problems?

                        Heart?  Has he complained of any
                          symptoms...?  Shortness of breath. 
                          Numbness in...

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...No...

                                        DOC COOPER
                        But you think he has heart
                          problems.  

          Cooper begins to suspect where Johnny is coming from and
          doesn't like it one bit.

                                        DOC COOPER
                        Listen, there's something you and
                          I should get straight right now. 
                        I don't believe in this psychic
                          nonsense...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then just think of me as a coach
                        asking you to examine a kid with
                        a sore hip pointer... and as the
                        team doctor, be sure to give him
                        a clean bill of health before he
                        plays tonight.  That's your job,
                        right?

          The two men stare at one another.  After a beat, the doc
          nods and moves on.  On Johnny's reaction...





          Three mothers are confronting Pelson.  The spokesPARENT
          (30) is holding a newspaper; an article about Johnny
          teaching at the high school, written by Dana Bright, is
          in clear display... Headline: "Teacher By Day, Psychic
          Deputy By Night"...

            Suddenly, she goes quiet as she realizes...


          ANGLE - JOHNNY

          is standing there.  The parents all look at him with
          suspicion.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (dry)
                        Am I interrupting something?

          Johnny looks around the room.  The parents avoid eye
          contact.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Pelson, when you have a minute,
                        could I talk to you ?

                                        PELSON
                        Come into my office.  I think
                        we're finished here.

          Johnny moves through the parents and most let him pass
          but the spokeswoman deliberately stands in his way and
          just stares at Johnny... Johnny can actually see hate in
          her eyes...

                                        PELSON
                        Excuse us.

          Pelson deftly moves the woman out of the way and leads
          Johnny into his office and closes the door... as the
          parents react and filter out...



          A very modest house in a middle income neighborhood. 
          Johnny takes a beat to make the final decision, then rings
          the doorbell.

          A beat later the door opens to reveal MRS. PALEY, 40,
          Todd's mother...

                        My name is Johnny Smith.  I'm one
                        of Todd's coaches at school.

          She looks at him dubiously.

                                        MRS. PALEY
                        I've heard about you.  Todd isn't
                        here.

          Johnny reacts and as Walt guides the way, they turn a

          waiting for him... they swarm around him... microphones

          Johnny tries to ignore them... but his eyes are caught by
          a face - Man#1 is wearing the same funny hat but now he's
          shooting pictures with a still camera... and there's
          Woman#1 and the Shopkeeper, holding microphones, and the
          Old Checkers Players and the Young Couple - faces he's
