      We INTERCUT between two people, waking up:  

      KATE FOX, 26, lies asleep in her perfectly made bed.  Her *
      eyes pop open at 6:29 and she shuts off her alarm before it 
      BEEPS.  

      BEN FOX, 28, lies face down, fully clothed, on top of his 
      Star Wars comforter.  His alarm BEEPS on the bedside table -- *
      it s a coffee maker.  He reaches over and pushes a toaster *
      button down.  *

      --Kate takes a shower.  

      --Ben watches TECH NEWS in bed.  The toaster POPS.  A piece *
      of pizza comes out.  He opens his bedside table (which is *
      also a mini fridge) and takes out some OJ, drinks.    *

      --Kate puts on the Target version of a perfect J Crew outfit.  

      --Ben takes off his Cheerios T-shirt, airs it out, and puts *
      it back on.  *

      --Kate brushes her teeth, then mouthwash, then floss.

      --Ben reaches into a toothbrush holder and pulls out a pack 
      of gum. 

      --Kate expertly packs a child s backpack.  

      --Ben hastily shoves things into a suitcase.  The door slams.  
      He rips an eviction notice off it.   *

      --A yoga DVD plays while Kate pays bills.  WIDER REVEALS 
      she s in downward dog.  

      --Ben goes running.  WIDER REVEALS he s chasing a cab. 


      It s neat and homey, cobbled together from garage-sale finds.  
      Kate puts the finishing touches on an elaborate emergency 
      kit.  Bins labeled -- FLOOD, FIRE, BIRD FLU, SWINE FLU.  As 
      Kate labels the last one:  PANDEMIC - OTHER,  she steps back 
      and smiles.  Perfect.  

      Just then, Kate s daughter MADDIE, 5, enters, holding two *
      identical shirts.  *

                                  MADDIE
                    This one or that one?                                                                                       2.


                                  KATE
                    What s wrong with the one you have 
                    on? 

                                  MADDIE
                    This is my emergency shirt.  In 
                    case something bad happens at 
                    school.  

                                  KATE
                          (kneeling down)
                    Oh, sweetheart, nothing bad is 
                    gonna happen, I promise.  I have 
                      everything under control.  

      Kate blows Maddie a kiss.  Maddie blows one back, machine-gun 
      style and Kate falls to the floor, clutching her heart.  
      Maddie laughs. 


      Kate double checks the EpiPen in her emergency kit--

                                  KATE
                    See you gotta make sure the EpiPen 
                    isn t expired otherwise boom -- 
                    reduced efficacy.  

                                  MADDIE
                    What am I allergic to? 

                                  KATE
                    Well, nothing yet.  But you ve got 
                    your whole life ahead of you.

      Just then, the creepy guy climbs in through the French doors *
      behind Kate.  He gets tangled in the curtains.  Maddie 
      SCREAMS.  Kate spins and stabs him repeatedly with the EpiPen.  
      He spazzes out, beating away the curtains. 

                                  MADDIE
                    Uncle Ben!  

                                  BEN
                          (to Kate)
                    What is wrong with you?!

      Ben yanks the EpiPen out of his neck and throws it at Kate as 
      Maddie jumps into his arms.  

                                  END COLD OPEN                                                                                       3.


                                            ACT ONE


      Ben Fox does adrenaline laps around the living room in his 
      Cheerios T-shirt. 

                                  BEN
                    Fight or flight, fight or flight.  
                    Why did you stab me with 
                      adrenaline?!

                                  KATE
                    Why did you break into my house? 

                                  BEN
                    I was trying to surprise you. 

                                  KATE
                    You know I hate surprises--

      POP TO A YOUNG KATE sleeps in the top of a bunk bed as a *
      YOUNG BEN climbs in the window.  Kate wakes, startled, and *
      SCREAMS.  She immediately falls off the bed with a THUD.*

                                  YOUNG BEN*
                    Hey, so I get top bunk tonight? *

      BACK TO SCENE.*

                                  KATE
                    What are you doing here?  

                                  BEN
                    I missed you guys.  But I m here *
                    for a reason.  In fact, why don t *
                    you sit down?  *

                                    MADDIE*
                          (serious)*
                    This is a Ben-tervention.  *

                                  BEN*
                    That s a Maddie original, TM.  *

                                  KATE*
                    Have you guys been talking about *
                    me?  Wait, an intervention for me?  *

      Wordlessly, Ben opens the closet to reveal her insane emergency *
      kit.  Then he ceremoniously snaps off her fanny pack.  *

                                  KATE (CONT D)*
                    No....  I just wear it around the *
                    house....  *                                                                                      4.


      POP TO Kate wearing her fanny pack at the store, by the pool, *
      over her gown at the OBGYN.  BACK TO SCENE. *

                                  BEN*
                    We re all worried about you.  You *
                    need to get out more. *

                                  KATE*
                    Who s this  we ?*

      Just then BJ, 25, lets herself in.  She s wearing a slutty *
      dress, clearly on a walk of shame.  She kicks off her shoes-- *

                                  BJ*
                    I brought Spanx.  You re definitely *
                    gonna need Spanx.  *

      BJ starts taking hers off as Kate turns to Ben-- *

                                  KATE*
                    What is she talking about? *

                                  BEN*
                      Listen...*
                          (opening his mouth)*
                    You can hear my heartbeat in my *
                    throat.  *

                                  BJ*
                          (eyeing Kate)*
                    I say we go for  sexy librarian  so *
                    the whole I ve-given-up-and-there s-*
                        a-fanny-pack-where-my-vagina-used-*
                    to-be thing seems intentional.  *

                                  KATE*
                    Will somebody please tell me what s *
                    going on? *

      BJ hands Kate the Spanx she was just wearing.  *

                                  BEN*
                    Remember that Ryan guy from High *
                    School?  *

      POP TO the back of someone s head.  Luxurious, bouncing hair.  *
      REVEAL it s a hot guy, RYAN.  YOUNG KATE (frizzy hair, *
      braces) stands at her locker.  He passes, oblivious, as Kate *
      takes his picture--*

                                  YOUNG KATE*
                    For yearbook?*

      Kate opens her locker.  There are a bunch of weird photos of *
      Ryan inside.  BACK TO SCENE. *                                                                                      5.


                                  KATE*
                    Vaguely.  Barely.  Whatever.  Shut *
                    up. *

                                  BEN*
                    I set you guys up on a date!*

                                  KATE*
                    You what?!*

                                  BEN *
                    Come on, you re Most Likely to *
                      Succeed...he s Best Hair.  *
                          (off Kate s look)*
                    He asked about you last time I was *
                    here.  Well, he asked if you were *
                    still a lesbian and I said you *
                    never were, you just thought socks *
                    with sandals were more comfortable, *
                    and he said he always thought you *
                    were cute but that you needed to *
                    loosen up--*
                          (then)*
                    Am I having a seizure?  *

                                  KATE*
                    Ben, I don t need your help. *

      Kate opens the pantry and uses a broom to knock something off *
      the top shelf into her hands. *

                                  KATE (CONT D)*
                    Wait-- he knows who I am?  *

                                  BJ*
                    You haven t been on a date since *
                    Maddie was born.  And that was, *
                    like, twenty six years ago. *

                                    MADDIE*
                    I m five.*

                                  BEN*
                    It s not about the date.  The *
                    date s a metaphor, dude.  It s *
                    about you getting your life back on *
                    track.  *

                                  KATE*
                    My life?  What about you?  What *
                    ever happened to that office sleep *
                    system you were working on?  *

      POP TO Ben demonstrates his sleep system (a multi-functional *
      travel pillow complete with fake files to hide behind).  *                                                                                      6.


      He  sleeps  in three different positions on a desk.  BACK TO *
      SCENE.  *

                                  BEN*
                    I just have to do a patent *
                      application but since I didn t *
                    follow through with the...  *
                          (seeing something)*
                    ...hey, is that hummus?   *

      Ben makes a lobster claw because he can t reach it.  Kate *
      pushes the hummus towards him--*

                                  BEN (CONT D)*
                    This is the moment.  You re *
                    teetering on the edge of cat *
                    lady....  It s now or never.  *

                                  KATE*
                    Look, this has been super fun, but *
                    I m fine.  And do me a favor and *
                    mind your own business.  *

      Just then, the DOORBELL RINGS.  Kate opens it to see TOMMY, *
      28, standing there in his tennis whites with a sweatband on *
      his long flowy blond hair.  *

                                  TOMMY*
                    Hello, Kate.  I heard you have a *
                    date tomorrow. *
                          (as Kate walks away)*
                    It s just weird since I ve been *
                    asking you out for six years....*
                          (then, hugging Ben)*
                    Ben Fox is in the house!  *

                                  KATE*
                    Tommy, we had sex once during my *
                      TOMMYKATE
      Hot phase.Fat phase. 

                                  KATE (CONT D)*
                    You need to let it go.*

      Ben covers his ears and makes a loud noise as we POP TO Tommy *
      hitting on Kate throughout the years:*

                                  THANKSGIVING TOMMY*
                    How  bout now?*

                                  THANKSGIVING KATE*
                    No.*

                                  CHRISTMAS TOMMY*
                    Now? *                                                                                      7.


                                  CHRISTMAS KATE*
                    No. *

                                  VALENTINES TOMMY*
                    But you re in another fat phase *
                    now...*

      Kate just looks at him.  WIDER REVEALS she s pregnant.  BACK *
      TO SCENE.*

                                  BEN*
                    You re disgusting.  Both of you. *

                                  TOMMY*
                    It won t be disgusting once we re *
                    married.  *

      Maddie walks in, ready for school.  *

                                  BEN
                    Okay, it s National Ben Day.  *
                    Maddie s gonna take the day off....*

      Maddie squeals happily and tosses her emergency shirts aside *
      as she gets her coat.  Kate gives Ben a look. *

                                  BEN (CONT D)*
                    You ll take Tommy s car and I ll *
                    take Maddie on some errands so you *
                    can go to work then get your hair *
                    fixed. *

                                  KATE*
                          (a beat)*
                    What s wrong with my hair? 

                                  BEN
                    Are you kidding?  You look like you 
                    just got out of prison. 

                                  KATE
                    I m a single mom, I don t have time 
                    for that kind of-- *

      Kate stops, looking out the back door.  There s A PILE OF *
      BEN S STUFF there -- suitcases, boxes, a lamp.  *

                                  KATE (CONT D)*
                    Did you stage a fake intervention *
                    because you needed a place to stay? *

                                  BEN*
                    Don t change the subject.  Did I *
                    get evicted?  Yes.  *
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      8.

                                  BEN (CONT'D)
                    Am I having some legal issues that *
                    prevent me from being in the state *
                    of Arizona right now?  Objection.  *
                    Hearsay.  The bottom line is...you *
                    need help.  And I m here for you.  *

      As her friends look at her pityingly, Kate sighs, frustrated.  *


      Kate struggles to drive BJ home in Tommy s stupid rape van:  

                                  KATE
                    I need help?!  He s the one who s *
                    homeless.  I love how he just shows *
                    up here with his Cheerios T-shirt 
                    and his good-time Charlie routine 
                    and he judges me!  He had a carry-*
                    on bag of fake tattoos!  Every time *
                    Ben Fox comes to town, something 
                    bad happens. 

                                  BJ
                    Look out! *

                                  KATE*
                          (swerving)*
                    Ah!  What?!  What!*

      They hit the curb.  A hubcap rolls across the street. *

                                  BJ*
                    See, nothing bad happened.*
                          (the bumper falls off)*
                    I think I might still be drunk. *


      Tommy sits shotgun as Ben drives.  Maddie s in back.

                                  BEN
                    Hey Mad Hatter, you been practicing 
                    your Pig Latin? 

                                  MADDIE
                    Veni vidi--
                          (she snorts like a pig)
                    Carpe-- (snort)

                                  BEN
                    Nice work. 

      Tommy leans in, intense--                                                                                      9.


                                  TOMMY
                    There s something I need to tell *
                    you...I didn t know how to.... *
                          (a beat)*
                    Darcy got engaged.  *

      Ben pulls over, deadly calm.  *

                                  BEN*
                    When?  When did it happen? *

                                  TOMMY*
                    Um...*
                          (counting on his fingers)*
                      Approximately one year ago.  *

      Ben hits him repeatedly with a newspaper then pulls back into *
      traffic, furious. *

                                  TOMMY (CONT D)*
                    I didn t know how to tell you!  I *
                    know how much she means to you.  *

                                  BEN*
                    Yeah, sure, why would I care what s *
                    going on with the only woman I ve *
                    ever loved.  The one I refer to *
                      exclusively as Mrs. Ben Fox.  *

                                  TOMMY*
                    The wedding s in three days.  *

                                  BEN*
                    What?!  *

                                  TOMMY*
                    Just kidding, it s tomorrow. *

                                  BEN*
                    I m going.  I ve gotta go.  *

                                  TOMMY*
                    Yup, don t worry, we re gonna crash *
                    this wedding.  I ve got a plan.  *

                                  BEN*
                    You had a year to think about it!  *

                                  TOMMY*
                    Drop me off at the Army Surplus *
                    store.  We re gonna need supplies.*                                                                                    10.



      It s that local bar that everyone comes back to when they re 
      home.  Kate and BJ work together in matching titty shirts.  
      The BARTENDER puts cocktails on BJ s tray as Kate adjusts 
      them for greater stability. 

                                  KATE
                    He doesn t save me.  I save him!
                          (then)
                    Fine, so maybe I m a little 
                      controlling. 

                                  BJ
                    Nobody said that.  To your face.  *

                                  KATE
                          (taking BJ s tray)
                    Here, lemme do that for you.  

      As Kate serves BJ s table, BJ just shrugs and pours herself a 
      stiff drink.  *


      Maddie sits in the cart as Ben makes lunch for her out of 
      grocery-store samples.  

                                  BEN
                    Nobody knows your mom like I do.  
                    Trust me, she s in survival mode.  
                    Did you see that emergency kit?  
                    That s a cry for help.                                                                                     11.


                                  MADDIE
                    What s a cry for help?  

                                  BEN
                    You know when somebody s about to 
                    off themself so they give away 
                    their record collection because 
                    they secretly don t want to do it 
                    and they re hoping you ll try and 
                    stop them but you really just want 
                    the record collection?  
                          (Maddie nods)
                    It s kinda like that. 


      Kate s got foils on her head, still defending herself:  

                                  KATE
                    I get out.  I get out all the time.  
                    What mom brought Amstel Light to *
                    the last PTA meeting?  Can I get a *
                    what what? 
                          (the HAIR GUY frowns)
                    I went to a sexy costume party the 
                    other day....

                                  HAIR GUY
                    Oh yeah, what was the theme? *

                                  KATE
                    Yo Gabba Gabba. *
                          (realizing)
                    Wow.  Wow.  Is he right...?  No, if *
                    I can just get through this next 
                    year, I ll finally have some time 
                    for myself.  

                                  HAIR GUY
                    I used to say that....  I woke up *
                    ten years later with lady boobs and *
                    a second mortgage. 


      Ben pushes Maddie in the cart.  He hands her items and she 
      chucks them into the cart.  Their routine.  

                                  BEN*
                    ...And that was the moment I *
                      knew...Darcy and I were meant to be *
                    together forever.  So...what s up *
                    with you?  *                                                                                    12.


                                    MADDIE*
                    Not much.  *

                                  BEN
                    You still wearing diapers? 
                          (Maddie shakes her head -- 
                          no)
                    You still afraid of the dark?
                          (Maddie nods -- yes)*
                    Me too. *
                          (REVVING a power drill)*
                    Maybe I should drill the moon into *
                    the ground so that it s never 
                      nighttime. 

                                  MADDIE
                          (giggling)
                    NO!!!


      Kate gets up from getting her hair washed.  She tries to get 
      a signal on her baby monitor.

                                  KATE
                    Do you have wifi?  I just need to make *
                    sure everything s okay at home. 

                                  HAIR GUY
                    Isn t your kid, like, a thousand?

                                  KATE
                    She s five.  And, yes, I live-*
                    stream video from a nanny cam in my *
                    kitchen and there s nothing *
                    obsessive and controlling about it.*

      He looks at her sideways.  Without a hint of irony--

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Ooh, hot spot!

      Kate shows him the nanny-cam view of her kitchen, where she s 
      surprised to see Ben and Tommy wearing Mexican wrestling *
      masks.*


                                  BEN
                    I don t think we should wear masks.  
                    Way too hot.  And it makes my hair 
                    itch.                                                                                     13.



                                  HAIR GUY
                    I didn t know your brother was gay.  

                                  KATE
                    What are they doing? 

      Kate watches as Ben and Tommy wrestle each other to the *
      ground.  *

                                  BEN (ON MONITOR)
                    We re gonna crash the crap out of 
                    this wedding!*

      Maddie runs by wearing night-vision goggles, screaming:  

                                  MADDIE
                    We re going to a wedding!!  I GET 
                    TO BE THE BRIDE!!!

      As Maddie smashes into the kitchen island and falls out of 
      frame.  Kate frowns then suddenly flies out of the chair, her *
      hair wet and partially cut, and still wearing her smock.  *

      A beat then she comes back into frame, her wallet out:*

                                  KATE*
                    Should we pro-rate this?  *
                          (a beat)*
                    Never mind.  *

      She throws some money at him and runs out.  *

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    14.


                                            ACT TWO


      Maddie stands on the front of the vacuum cleaner as Ben vacuums 
      the house.  Kate storms in, her hair like Bill the Cat.  *

                                  KATE
                    So now you re crashing a wedding?!*

                                  BEN*
                    What s wrong with your hair?  

                                  KATE
                    Um, I had to leave early because my *
                    child was wearing night-vision *
                    googles in broad daylight.*

                                  BEN
                    Wow.  Maternal instinct is insane.  *
                    That s like ESP, man.  *

                                  KATE
                    No, you idiot, I was watching you *
                    on the Internet nanny cam I had 
                    installed in this fake cookie jar.

                                  BEN
                    Now who s the crazy one?  What kind 
                    of monster makes a fake cookie jar?  
                    I ve been trying to get into that 
                    thing since I got here.

                                  KATE
                    I can t believe I actually thought 
                    you were worried about me.  Have *
                    you ever done one truly selfless *
                    thing?*

                                  BEN*
                    Selfish? *

                                  KATE*
                    Selfless!  *

                                  BEN*
                    Oh, I was gonna say.  I do that all *
                    the time. *

                                  KATE
                    And now I have this stupid date *
                    tomorrow and half a hairdo.*

      Kate opens the pantry and a set of retractable steps pop out.  
      She steps up and easily plucks something off the top shelf.  *                                                                                    15.


                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Oh my god you re a genius.  I can t 
                    believe I never thought of that.  
                          (then)
                    Wait--  I m mad at you.  *
                          (as Maddie runs off to *
                            play)*
                    This is the same crap I ve been 
                    dealing with my whole life.  And *
                    I m gonna do it this time.  I am *
                    not gonna get sucked into one of *
                    your hair-brained schemes and end *
                    up spending all my baby-sitting 
                    money bailing you out of jail....  *

                                  BEN
                    When did that ever happen? 

      POP TO A YOUNG KATE, sitting on telephone books so she can 
      steer the car while Ben quietly pushes it out the driveway.  
      CUT TO Ben joyriding through town while Kate covers her eyes.  
      WIDER REVEALS they re driving backwards.  A POLICE SIREN 
      sounds....  BACK TO SCENE.   

                                  KATE*
                    Ben, I have a child.  I m a *
                      responsible adult and--  *

                                  BEN
                    It s Darcy s wedding. 

      Kate gasps, knowing what that means.  She sits, deadly serious:  *

                                  KATE
                    Okay, show me what you ve got.  
                          (scanning his papers)
                    These specs are all wrong...where 
                    did you get your data?

      Ben gestures to the couch.  REVEAL Tommy, fast asleep.  

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Ben, Tommy can t sleep on your 
                    couch.

                                  BEN
                    Why? 

                                  KATE
                     Cause you re sleeping on my couch. 

                                  BEN*
                    When I found out she was getting *
                    married, I just--  I always thought *
                    we d find our way back, you know?  *                                                                                    16.


      Kate finds a piece of paper and reads:

                                  KATE
                     Stop.  Don t get married.  Boo.  *
                    Remember how awesome I am?   Okay, 
                    I ll be rewriting that later....  
                    Look, if we re gonna do this, no 
                    Maddie.  She s a delicate kid --
                    she s still sleeping with the light 
                    on -- so just, keep her out of 
                    this, okay?

                                  BEN
                      Absolutely. 

      Just then, Maddie emerges (out of Kate s view) wearing a full-
      blown NAVY SEAL outfit.  As Kate looks down at the plans, he 
      signals Maddie to retreat.  Just then, the DOORBELL RINGS and *
      Kate gets up to get it.*

                                  KATE
                    Alright, I m gonna go get my hair 
                    fixed, again, and then meet you and 
                    Tommy to scout the location.      

      Ben opens the door to see a cute but awkward BABY SITTER, 25.  
      He kisses her hand--

                                  BEN
                    You must be the baby sitter.  

                                  KATE
                    No...  Just--  No.  


      Ben, Kate, and Tommy sneak through the country club, trying 
      to act casual. *


      The ballroom is decorated for the wedding.  Kate snaps into *
        theater-geek mode:

                                  KATE
                    Okay, let s do this.  Tommy, you be 
                    the bride.  Ben-- do you have that 
                    speech I wrote for you?  
                          (he pulls it out)
                    That was a trick question.  You 
                    should be off book by now.  

      Tommy gets up on the altar as Kate crouches like a director:                                                                                    17.


                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Alright, gang, speak now or forever 
                    hold your peace.

      Ben comes crashing through the doors: 

                                  BEN
                    Stop!  Don t do it!*
                          (he stops)
                    I didn t love that.  That felt 
                    weird.  

                                  KATE
                    Yeah, let s take it again.  And 
                    this time, a little less rapey.   

      Ben tries again, walking towards Tommy, reading Kate s speech:*

                                  BEN
                     I know I don t have a job or 
                    health insurance or a place to live 
                    or even enough gas to get home....  
                          (stepping up to the altar)
                    But can you honestly say that you 
                    don t think about me?  That you 
                    don t secretly wonder if one day I 
                    might come back.  Take her hand. 

      Ben takes Tommy s hand. 

                                  KATE
                    Cut!  That s the stage direction.  
                    You don t have to read that part. *
                    I need you to focus.  I m not gonna *
                    be there to prompt you-- *

                                  BEN*
                    Wait, you re not coming?  *

                                  KATE*
                    I support you and everything...but *
                    it might be illegal.  Come on--*
                          (stepping in for Ben)*
                    You gotta say it like you mean it.  *
                    Like you re gonna die if you don t. 
                          (she takes Tommy s hands, 
                            intense)
                    Can you honestly say you don t 
                    think about me?  That you don t 
                    secretly wonder if one day I might 
                    come back?  
                          (Tommy gets lost in her 
                          big blue eyes)
                    Say it.  Say you don t love me.*                                                                                    18.


      As Tommy leans in for the kiss, Kate walks away, oblivious.*

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Okay, let s take it from the top.  


      Ben and Maddie play RISK as Kate comes out wearing maternity *
      jeans, a headset and her fanny pack with her cell phone in *
      it.  Her sports bra makes it look like she has one boob.  She 
      holds up two matching shirts:

                                  KATE
                    This one or that one?  

                                  MADDIE
                          (to Ben)
                    It s an emergency shirt.  In case 
                    something bad happens on the date.

      Ben looks up at her ridiculous outfit. 

                                  BEN
                    Take both.  And no fanny pack.  *

      Kate plops down on a kitchen stool. 

                                  KATE
                    I m not ready to start dating!

                                  BEN
                    Dude, it s been five years.  It s *
                    time to take off the maternity jeans.  

                                  KATE*
                          (lifting up her shirt)
                    But there s a stretchy panel and it *
                    expands when you eat and sucks in  
                    your jizzley-jazzley bits.    *

                                  BEN
                    Please never say  jizzley-jazzley *
                    bits  again.  What happened to you?  *
                    You used to be so cool.

                                  KATE
                    No, that was you.  You used to take 
                    me everywhere and make me do fun 
                    things.  I m not cool without you.  
                          (then, seriously)
                    I don t think I can do this.  *                                                                                    19.


                                  BEN
                          (sitting down beside her)*
                    You re just out of practice.  The 
                    hardest part is stepping up to the 
                    cricket wicket.  I know that if you *
                    never step up, you don t have to *
                    worry about somebody knocking your *
                    wicket over--  *

                                  KATE
                    Exactly!  I think....  *

                                  BEN
                    But you gotta get back in the game.  
                    To show your daughter that s what 
                    you do.*

                                  MADDIE
                    You can do it, Mom.  I believe in 
                    you.

      Kate nods at her daughter, inspired.  

                                  KATE
                    Okay. 

                                  MADDIE
                    Yay!  We re gonna play dress up!!

      As Maddie follows Kate into her room-- *

                                  BEN*
                    And no Eat, Pray, Love pants -- 
                    nothing with a drawstring!


      The DOORBELL RINGS.  Kate comes out wearing a much better *
      outfit.  She opens the door to see the Baby Sitter: *

                                  KATE
                    Oh hey, thanks so much for coming.  

      But the girl just walks in, slaps Ben, and walks out. 

                                  BABY SITTER
                    I quit.  

      She SLAMS the door as Kate stands there, in shock.  

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    20.


                                  ACT THREE


      BJ s in uniform.  Kate nervously rearranges sugars while 
      playing video bar trivia and checking the door.  

                                  KATE
                    So what are the kids doing these 
                    days, you know, out there on the 
                    scene?

                                  BJ
                    Well, first of all, we re doing our 
                    best not to call it  the scene.  

                                  KATE*
                    I m just nervous.  The last person *
                    who saw my boobs was Maddie.  And *
                    she quit breast-feeding without me *
                    asking.  *

                                  BJ*
                    Yeah, so maybe don t say that on *
                    the date.  *

                                  KATE*
                          (slumping on the bar)*
                    I just want Maddie to know what a *
                    good relationship looks like.  

      POP TO Young Ben and Kate sit at the dinner table as their 
      PARENTS yell at each other in the other room.  Kate s upset.  
      Ben slowly slides under the table.  A beat, then he pulls her 
      under, too.  They sit there, cross-legged.  A beat.  Kate 
      smiles.  BACK TO SCENE.  BJ puts her arm around Kate-- 

                                  BJ
                    You ll get there.   

      Just then, their HOT BOSS, 40, comes out with money for the *
      register.  He nods at BJ.  *

                                  BJ (CONT D)*
                    You ll find someone just like I *
                    did.  Now he s kind of guy who d be *
                    a great husband and father--*                                                                                    22.


                                  KATE*
                    He is.  To his wife and kids....*

                                  BJ*
                    He s gonna leave her, he promised.    *

                                  KATE*
                    That s such a clich .   *

                                  BJ*
                    Yeah, but it s a clich  for a *
                    reason.  *

                                  KATE*
                          (a beat)*
                    Because they never leave their *
                    wives!  *


      Ben hangs with Maddie, checking his watch.

                                  BEN
                    Okay, so I may have told your mom 
                    the wedding was a scosche later, so 
                    that I could get her out of the 
                    house.  
                          (grabbing the keys)
                    We gotta go.  

      Ben and Maddie put on their fancy shoes.  

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    What s your cover? 

                                  MADDIE
                    I m the bride!  

                                  BEN
                      Incorrect.  You re a distant cousin 
                    who doesn t speak English.  And if 
                    anyone tries to talk to you-- 

                                  MADDIE
                    No hablo ingles.  

                                  BEN
                    Exactly. 

      Ben grabs the wireless baby monitor and turns up the volume.  
      Strangely, we can hear Kate, out on her date...  

                                  KATE (ON MONITOR)
                    Hey, Ryan, it s good to see you.                                                                                     23.


                                  RYAN (ON MONITOR) 
                    Yeah, you too.  

      As Ben and Maddie walk out with the baby monitor....


      Ryan and Kate sit down at a table.  He looks around. 

                                  RYAN
                    This place looks exactly the same.  
                    I can t believe you actually work 
                    here.  

                                  KATE
                    I did a spreadsheet and figured out 
                    that working here Thursday, Friday, 
                    and Saturday nights, I can make the 
                    most money and spend the least 
                    amount of time away from my kid.  

      Kate shows him a picture of Maddie on her phone.

                                  RYAN
                    Wow.  That s like, a real kid. *

                                  KATE
                    Yeah, I had her my Junior year of *
                    college.  I never really got a *
                    chance to graduate....  *

                                  RYAN
                    What happened to the father?  *

      POP TO Kate telling her BOYFRIEND:  

                                  KATE
                    I m pregnant!

                                  BOYFRIEND
                    I ll get the champagne! 

      We hear a SCREECH and his car takes off.  BACK TO SCENE.

                                  KATE
                    I don t know.  He didn t leave a 
                      forwarding address.  *

      Ryan just looks at her.  Yikes.  *


      Ben drives with Maddie in the back.  He turns up the nanny *
      cam MONITOR on the dash: *                                                                                    24.


                                  RYAN (ON MONITOR)*
                    Sounds like a lot of work.*

                                  KATE (ON MONITOR) *
                    What?  Breaking up with me?  Well *
                    he could ve just scribbled it on a *
                    Post-It or sent me an email...*

                                  RYAN (ON MONITOR) *
                    I meant taking care of the kid.   *

      Ben frowns...*


      Kate nervously sips her drink.  

                                  KATE
                    When my brother told me you asked 
                    about me, I was really surprised.  *
                    I didn t think you knew I existed.  

                                  RYAN
                    I didn t.  He showed me a bunch of *
                    pictures and some earthquake video *
                    and then I remembered...you were *
                    that nerdy chick who always took 
                    pictures of me for yearbook! 

      Kate laughs nervously.


      Ben just shakes his head.  *


                                  KATE
                    Well...I didn t exactly work for 
                    yearbook.  But I was Editor in 
                    Chief of Menses.  
                          (off his confusion)
                    The feminist literary magazine?  We 
                    won a few prestigious awards, 
                      whatever....  
                          (then)
                    Those pictures were mostly just for 
                    personal use.  

      As BJ walks past, Kate takes a glass of wine off her tray, *
      downs it, and hands her the empty.  *

                                  KATE (CONT D)*
                    Can I be honest with you?  *                                                                                    25.



                                  BEN*
                          (grabbing the monitor)*
                    No!  Don t be honest!  *


                                  KATE*
                    My narcissistic, idiot man-child *
                    brother set this whole thing up.  *


                                  BEN*
                    I m sorry?  *


                                  KATE*
                    After I got pregnant, I kinda *
                    got...off track.  This is my first *
                    night out of the house without my *
                    fanny pack.  I mean, I m usually in *
                    bed by nine with a nice procedural *
                    and some Words With Friends, but I *
                    don t really have any, well, any *
                    who can spell...so mostly I just *
                    play against myself.  And *
                      sometimes...late at night... *
                          (leaning in *
                              conspiratorially)*
                    I take Theraflu, even though I m *
                    not sick.  *

      Ryan looks at her -- totally overwhelmed.  Kate freaks out--*

                                  KATE (CONT D)*
                    Is it hot in here?  I feel really, *
                    really hot.  *

      Kate pulls off her sweater and it accidentally takes her *
      shirt along with it.  She s stuck, caught inside her shirt, *
      flashing the entire restaurant.  *

                                  KATE (FROM INSIDE SWEATER) (CONT D)*
                    Oh my god.  Can you see my boobs?  *


      Ben grips the wheel. *

                                  BEN*
                    Come on, Maddie.  Your mom needs *
                    us.  *                                                                                    26.


      With that, Ben does a U-Turn and heads back. *


      Kate struggles, still inside her shirt--*

                                  KATE (FROM INSIDE SWEATER)*
                    I can t--  I ve got to--  *
                    Please don t look at me.  *

      Kate finally pulls her shirt down.  *

                                  KATE (CONT D)*
                    Will you excuse me?*

      Kate gets up and hurries to the bathroom.  The minute the *
      door closes, Ryan gets up to bail.  He s on his way out just *
      as Ben walks in. *

                                  BEN*
                    Hey dude, where re you going?*

       Maddie runs over to play a video game.  *

                                  RYAN*
                    Oh, come on...you gotta be kidding.  *
                    The waitressing job?  The fanny *
                    pack?  The kid?  *

      Ben Fox eyes him. *

                                  BEN*
                    You re the same douche you always *
                    were.  Only now you re just  Best *
                    Head.   *
                          (a beat)*
                    And I didn t mean that sexually.  *
                    Now why don t you get the hell out *
                    of here? *

      Kate comes out of the bathroom.  She sees Ben and Maddie *
      playing a video game.  REVEAL Ryan is gone.  *

                                  KATE*
                    What are you doing here?  Did Ryan *
                    leave?  *

                                  BEN*
                    No, I kicked him out.  *

                                  KATE*
                    What are you talking about?  *                                                                                    27.


                                  BEN*
                    Hey, what do I know?  I m just your *
                    idiot man-child brother. *

                                  KATE*
                    Wait--  How did you--?*

      Ben opens Kate s purse -- THE NANNY CAM s inside.  *

                                  BEN*
                    He wasn t good enough for you.  Not *
                    even close.  I wasn t gonna let you *
                    sit here all night. *

      A beat.  *

                                  KATE*
                    Thanks. *

      It s a nice moment but then--*

                                  KATE (CONT D)*
                    Wait, why are you all dressed up?*

                                  BEN*
                    What do you mean? *

                                  KATE*
                          (turning to Maddie)*
                    Were you going to the wedding?  *

      A beat. *

                                    MADDIE*
                    No hablo ingles.*

      Kate turns, about to yell at Ben, but then--*

                                  KATE*
                    You know what?  Screw it.  *
                          (taking Maddie s hand)*
                    Let s go crash that wedding.  *

      As they head out, BJ yelps excitedly, tearing off her apron. *

                                  HOT BOSS*
                    Your shift s not over. *

                                  BJ*
                    Yeah, neither is your marriage.  *

      As she tosses the apron at him.... *                                                                                    28.



      A few last-minute WEDDING GUESTS walk into the ballroom.  Ben *
      and Kate hurry up to an USHER:*

                                  BEN*
                    Do you know where Darcy is? *

                                  USHER*
                    Around the corner. *

      They run down the hall, around the corner, and see....*

                                  BEN*
                    Darcy!  *

      DARCY stands there in her wedding dress.  She looks beautiful. *

                                  DARCY*
                    Ben? *

                                  BEN*
                    I love you.  I always have.  Please *
                    don t get married.  Because....*
                          (checking the smeared note *
                          on his hand)*
                    So sweaty.  *
                          (wiping it on his pants)*
                    Okay, now it s just gone.  *
                          (then)*
                    Look, I can t remember what I m *
                    supposed to say.*

                                  DARCY*
                    Ben, stop--*

                                  KATE*
                          (sotto)*
                    Job, health insurance.  *

                                  BEN*
                    Oh right, I don t have a job or *
                    health insurance or any gas...*

      Ben looks at Kate, lost.  *

                                  DARCY*
                    I gotta go.  *                                                                                    29.


                                  KATE*
                    Wait a minute.  This is my brother *
                    we re talking about here.  I know *
                    he s been wearing the same shirt *
                    for the last ten years and he s *
                    only said he loved me twice -- once *
                    when he broke my arm and once when *
                    he broke my leg....  But he has the *
                    best heart of anyone I know.  And *
                    he may have a Velcro wallet now, *
                    but we ll all be working for him *
                      someday....  So if you want to go *
                    ahead and marry that boring rich *
                    bald guy -- yeah, I got google -- *
                    and spend the rest of your life not *
                    laughing, then go right ahead.  But *
                    if I were you?  I d bet on Ben Fox. *
                                                                                              *

                                  GROOM (O.S.)*
                      Sweetheart? *

      Kate turns to see the GROOM (the boring bald rich guy), *
      standing behind her.  *

                                  DARCY*
                    My wedding was an hour ago.  This *
                    is my husband.  *

                                  KATE*
                      Exactly...which is why I came to *
                    give you this.  *

      Kate reaches into her purse and pulls out-- *

                                  DARCY*
                    A fanny pack?   *

                                  KATE*
                    Yes.  No.  Actually...I should *
                    probably take that back.  *
                          (they struggle with it, *
                            Darcy relents)*
                    But also...this beautiful wallet.    *
                          (handing it to her)*
                    So thank you so much for inviting *
                    us...and congratulations!*

      Kate hugs Darcy.  Then Ben hugs her, way too close.  Darcy *
      can t help herself, she melts a little.  Ben holds her.  It s *
      inappropriate.  Kate stands there awkwardly with the Groom:*

                                  KATE (CONT D)*
                    Mazel Tov....  *                                                                                    30.


      As Kate pulls Ben away, we CUT TO....*


      Kate sits alone at a small table in the back of the room as *
      BJ dances with Maddie.  Kate watches the party, melancholy.  *

      There s a sudden burst of activity as Darcy tosses the *
      bouquet.  Kate starts to cry happy tears but then -- the GIRL *
      squeals and kisses her boyfriend -- and her tears turn real.  *

      From across the room, Ben clocks it.  *

      As Kate holds her head in her hands, Ben sits down across *
      from her.  She looks up, make-up running down her face, and *
      shrugs, unable to speak.  *

      A beat, then Ben slides under the table.  He pulls Kate under 
      with him.    

      UNDER THE TABLE

      They sit there, cross-legged, letting the world go by.*

                                  KATE*
                    My date was terrible, I couldn t *
                    even help you stop the wedding....  *
                    One day back in the world and I *
                    screwed everything up.  *

                                  BEN*
                    Good.  *
                          (off Kate s look)
                    Straight A s in high school, 
                    straight A s in college....  You 
                    need to fail more.  Look at me,  
                    I ve been failing my whole life.  I 
                    mean, I m no slouch...I ve got my 
                    ged.  

                                  KATE
                    You know it s pronounced G.E.D. 
                    right?  And it s high school.  Not 
                    college.

                                  BEN
                    Exactly.  And you still think I m 
                    gonna succeed.  Why can t you do 
                    that for yourself?   

                                  KATE*
                    I like hiding.  It feels safe.  *                                                                                    31.


                                  BEN*
                    You know why I do stupid stuff like *
                    blow things up and light fireworks?  *

                                  KATE*
                     Cause you re an idiot.  *

                                  BEN*
                    Because it s fun.  Sometimes just *
                    knowing you could get hurt... *
                    that s what makes it worth it.  *

      Just then, Maddie pokes her head under--  *

                                  MADDIE
                    What are you doing?!*

                                  BEN
                    You ve only made one mistake your 
                    entire life...and it s the best 
                    thing that ever happened to you. *

      Maddie climbs onto Kate s lap.  Kate squeezes her.*

                                  BEN (CONT D)*
                    What if I stay and help take care *
                    of her so that you can get out *
                    there and make some more mistakes?  *

                                  KATE
                    You would do that for me? 

                                  BEN
                    I could move some things around, *
                    clear up my schedule....*
                          (then)*
                    You ve been bailing me out my whole 
                    life.  Let me bail you out for once.  

                                  MADDIE
                    He can sleep in my playroom. *

      Kate smiles.  *

                                  KATE*
                    Thank you.  Even though I know this *
                    is partly because you re avoiding *
                    jail time in Arizona.  *

                                  BEN*
                      Objection.  Cause for speculation.*

      Just then, Tommy puts his head under the table.  *                                                                                    32.


                                  TOMMY*
                    What are you guys doing?  *

      As Tommy helps Kate out from under the table, she sees...*

                                  KATE*
                    Are you wearing my maternity jeans? 

      Ben lifts up his shirt.  He s wearing them too. 

                                  BEN
                    You weren t kidding about these 
                    things.  They re extremely 
                      comfortable.  I m working on a new 
                    line for men.  It s called 
                      Manternity--  
                          (earmuffing Maddie)
                    It s extra stretchy in the nut 
                    part.  

      As they all react to his dumb idea, Tommy pulls Kate onto the *
      dance floor with BJ, Maddie, and Ben.  As FUN WEDDING SONG *
      plays us out....*

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    33.


                                        TAG


      Ben carries Maddie to bed as Kate pulls the covers over her.  *
      Ben s about to shut off the lights when Kate stops him-- *

                                  KATE*
                    Don t, she ll freak out. *

      Ben holds up a finger and hands Maddie the night-vision *
      goggles.  Then he shuts off the lights.  As Maddie cuddles *
      them like a teddy bear....  *


      As they close the door and walk back down the hall together-- *

                                  KATE*
                    You love me, admit it. *

                                  BEN*
                    It s not gonna happen.*

                                  KATE*
                    Oh, come on. *

                                  BEN*
                    You want me to break the other arm? *

      A beat. *

                                  KATE*
                    I love you too.  *

      As he punches her hard, WE RE OUT.  *
