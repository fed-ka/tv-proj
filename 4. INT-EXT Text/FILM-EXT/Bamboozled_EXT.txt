The tenement building is boarded up, condemned, bombed out,
but a home, a shelter nonetheless.
WE SEE a street lamp, and coming out of it are some wires.
WE FOLLOW the wires into a tenement building.
The residents have tapped into a street light courtesy of
CON EDISON for power.
Cops in riot gear storm into the tenement.
A police chief
barks over a speaker system.
POLICE CHIEF
Please evacuate this building.
All
of you are illegal residents of
this condemned building.
Please
leave immediately, by order of the
Mayor of New York City, Rudolph
Giuliani.
It is a MADHOUSE, BEDLAM.
It's PANDEMONIUM.
The Squatters
are being seized as soon as they come out of the tenement.
Searchlights go back and forth, as the cops make their
arrests and fill the "Paddy" wagons.
ANGLE ON
Street.
The Squatters are like ROACHES in a dark kitchen at
night, scrambling as the lights turn on.
Do you remember
those old "RAID" commercials.
"Let's scram, IT'S RAID!!!"
Delacroix and Sloan sip hot coffee as they stand in front of
their office building.
DELACROIX
Manray was under our nose the whole
time.
SLOAN
Do you know how you will use him?
DELACROIX
Not yet, but this thing will never
get made.
18.
SLOAN
You lost me.
DELACROIX
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.
And
that's what I'm going to give him,
it's going to be so racist, so
negative, he won't have the balls
to put it on the air.
Hence I'll
prove my point.
SLOAN
What point is that?
DELACROIX
The point being that him, the
networks don't want Black people on
television unless they are buffoons.
SLOAN
Sounds risky to me.
DELACROIX
You getting cold feet?
SLOAN
I'm in till the end.
DELACROIX
Good.
I'm going to need your
support.
SLOAN
Can't you just quit?
Walk away?
DELACROIX
And lose out on my money?
The only
way I get paid is if I get fired.
And that's what I intend to do.
It is pouring rain and Delacroix and Sloan huddle under an
umbrella.
DELACROIX (V.O.)
Everything was going according to
plan.
I was working on the outline.
Dunwitty was off my back for now.
CLOSE ON
Delacroix.
19.
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But there was a catch.
A big catch.
CLOSE ON
Sloan.
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Manray and Cheeba were nowhere to
be found.
Manray and Cheeba are soaking wet.
They stand together in a
doorway, trying to stay out of the elements.
ANGLE ON
Street.
They run in the downpour.
DELACROIX (V.O.)
It was like they had disappeared
off the face of the earth.
CLOSE ON
Cheeba.
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I had no contact numbers, no
address, no beeper.
CLOSE ON
Manray.
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
No nuthin', no clues...
It is a sunny and pleasant morning.
Again, Sloan and
Delacroix hold vigil.
SLOAN
Maybe something happened to them.
Maybe they're lying in an alley
bleed to death.
DELACROIX
Manray better not be bleeding to
death.
I need him.
After we're
done he can do whatever he wants to
do, until then, he's ours.
20.
SLOAN
You're beginning to sound like
Dunwitty.
Manray and Cheeba stand across the street from their former
residence.
All of the doors and windows have been boarded
up and two cops stand watch.
They both look defeated, dirty
and hungry.
Sloan gets off the elevator and sees a skirmish.
TWO
SECURITY GUARDS are trying to escort Manray and Cheeba out
of the building.
CHEEBA
His name is Delapoint.
SECURITY GUARD #1
WE have no one by that name.
CHEEBA
Delapot.
Dela-something.
SECURITY GUARD #2
De La Soul ain't here either.
Let's go.
Out.
Off the premises.
Manray turns around and sees Sloan.
MANRAY
Sloan!
She knows us.
The security guard stops.
SLOAN
It's alright.
They are associates
of Mr. Delacroix.
SECURITY GUARD #1
Sorry, Ms. Hopkins.
They both
walked in off the street without an
appointment.
SECURITY GUARD #2
Do you need an escort?
SLOAN
That won't be needed.
21.
Manray holds two Capezio shopping bags of shoes as he walks
next to Sloan.
MANRAY
I never had a really real pair
before.
SLOAN
You've never had any formal
training, either?
MANRAY
Not a class, not a thing, just
picked stuff up by myself.
SLOAN
I wish I had your natural talent.
God only makes that visit once in a
while.
MANRAY
You sing and dance?
SLOAN
A little.
I just graduated from
NYU film school.
Cinema studies.
MANRAY
So what's up with you and DeLa?
SLOAN
What do you mean?
MANRAY
Are you and him kicking it?
Knocking boots.
Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
24.
SLOAN
No, we're not knocking boots.
I
got this internship while I still
was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with
my get up and go and hired me to be
his assistant.
MANRAY
I'm sure that was the only thing he
was impressed with.
You look
beautiful like that.
SLOAN
If that was suppose to be a
compliment, I thank you.
MANRAY
You're welcome.
You shouldn't give
up on performing.
SLOAN
Why do you say that?
You've never
seen me.
MANRAY
I think that would probably make
you the happiest.
When I'm hoofing,
I mean really doing my thing,
hitting it, nothing compares to
that feeling in the world.
SLOAN
I envy you.
That's the way I want
to feel about my work.
Sloan walks from the subway to her block.
ANGLE ON
Street.
A huge black Chevy Suburban follows her, all the
windows are tinted jet black, you cannot see it all into it.
She notices the vehicle and starts to walk faster.
ANGLE ON
Corner.
As Sloan tries to cross at the corner, the Suburban
pulls up in front of her, blocking her path.
ANGLE ON
Suburban.
A tall black man jumps out of the Chevy.
This is
BIG BLACK.
25.
BIG BLACK
Li'l Sister.
ANGLE ON
Corner.
SLOAN
You idiot.
You almost gave me a
massive coronary.
BIG BLACK
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
SLOAN
Well you did.
BIG BLACK
Give me some?
SLOAN
I'm not huggin' you in the middle
of the street.
You must be crazy,
Julius.
BIG BLACK
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.
I done
told you 'bout that.
Julius ain't
my name, you better recognize
Hopkins was our slave name.
My
true name is...
SLOAN
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa.
Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
BIG BLACK
BIG BLACK is the first name and
AFRICA is the last.
He hugs her, she becomes lost in his huge arms and laughs.
Cheeba and Mantan are walking in midtown Manhattan.
They
both have a pep in their step, money in their pockets, and a
roof over their heads.
CHEEBA
Life is beginning to look up.
It's
all good in da neighborhood.
MANTAN
You might be right.
CHEEBA
Why are you smiling so?
His smile is a mile wide.
MANTAN
I'm not smiling.
CHEEBA
Naw, not you.
It can't be.
That
hottie Sloan Hopkins.
MANTAN
It's that bad, huh?
It's all over
my face.
CHEEBA
No shame in ya game.
She got ya
nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open.
Sloan's what we certified ladies'
men call low hanging fruit.
MANTAN
Certified ladies' man, huh?
CHEEBA
She's also moorish.
35.
MANTAN
What's that?
CHEEBA
Moorish.
Ya get a little taste of
dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
MANTAN
Seconds and thirds, too.
CHEEBA
Sloan is all 'dat.
I try her.
I'm
a tri-sexual.
MANTAN
You'd try anything.
I got first
dibs.
You get ya own stuff.
CHEEBA
Naw, just jokin'.
That's you.
That's you.
Delacroix, followed by Sloan, enters the room full of writers.
CLOSE ON
Delacroix
He surveys the room.
P.O.V. - DELACROIX
All of the writers are Caucasian - male and female.
Every
single last one.
ANGLE ON
Conference room.
Delacroix and Sloan sit down at the head
of the long oval table.
DELACROIX
Good morning, for those of you who
don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix.
I'm running things and this here is
my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
SLOAN
Hello.
DELACROIX
I've never worked with any of you
and you've never worked with me so
we'll be starting from scratch.
I'm a fair person, a straight
shooter and I don't hold my tongue.
Everybody up in here should know I
had nothing to do with you being
hired.
(MORE)
47.
DELACROIX (CONT'D)
I would have preferred at least one
other Negro writer.
Any questions?
Comments?
MONA raises her hand.
DELACROIX (CONT'D)
Yes, your name?
MONA
He, I'm Mona.
DELACROIX
Hi, Mona.
MONA
I perfectly understand where you're
coming from.
As a minority I can
relate to your struggle also.
But
I think you should give us all a
chance.
We want this pilot to be
successful just as much as you.
Please don't be so quick to judge
us based only on our whiteness.
DELACROIX
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
BETH jumps in.
BETH
I think because of our background
we can bring a unique perspective
to Mantan.
SETH pipes in also.
SETH
A fresh pair of eyes.
A new look,
insight, new angle that hasn't been
seen before.
DELACROIX
I've heard this somewhere before.
David raises his hand.
48.
DAVID
My name is David.
I do think it
would be better to have some
African-American writers but for
whatever reason they are not here.
I don't know if they couldn't find
any people with experience, they
wouldn't work for the pay or
refused to work for the show.
I
don't know and nobody in this room
probably knows either.
I'm looking
at this as a unique opportunity.
We all should.
I'm a damn good
writer and I'm ready to go to work.
Everyone in the room applauds.
Sloan looks at Delacroix.
FREEZE FRAME
DELACROIX (V.O.)
This thing was rigged, the deck was
stacked, the fix was in.
Could Don
King be near?
Good thing Sloan had
my back.
She's my rock.
This was
going to be a whole lot of work.
UN-FREEZE FRAME
DELACROIX (CONT'D)
David, I appreciate your comments.
Anybody got an ideas?
Everybody
just talk out loud.
MONA
I've always liked the format of
Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
ANNA
That could be cool.
KIRK
What about something like "The
Jeffersons?"
I grew up in Idaho so
that's how I got my understanding
of black people.
Through Sherman
Helmsley, LOUISSEE!!!.
DAVID
"Good Times" was better.
Kid Dy-no
mite!!!
49.
AARON
You pole are going to far back for
me.
I think we have to go after a
hipper feel.
Like the stuff Eddie
Murphy used to do on "Saturday
Night Live."
PETER
Or Martin.
You go girl.
JEFF
What about the
black exploitation
films?
No one has ever tried
making that work on TV.
DAVID
And for reason.
Have you ever seen
"Scream Blacula, Scream?"
MONA
I think, and Delacroix will agree
with me, the politics of this show
have to be right.
We should always
be laughing with our characters,
not at them.
CLOSE ON
Delacroix, as the writers continue to ramble on, he lets
them jerk off.
DELACROIX (V.O.)
The mission was accomplished.
All
of these people left the room
thinking they would have real input.
I was writing this pilot alone,
myself, me.
A long line reaches down the block and around the corner.
It's a "cattle call," open auditions for "Mantan."
DELACROIX (V.O.)
Now came the fun part, finding the
talented performers to cast in the
show.
WE DOLLY past the hundreds and hundreds of unemployed
African American actors, many of them dressed in various
costumes.
50.
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Everybody and their mother was
trying to get in, trying to be seen.
Trying to get their piece of the
rock.
Delacroix knocks and they enter.
Sloan and Delacroix enter the dressing room.
Delacroix is in the same position as the scene before.
Face
buried in his hands.
ON PHONE
It rings and he picks it up.
DELACROIX
Hello?

Dunwitty drives his Mercedes Benz CL 600 Coupe.
DUNWITTY
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from
the CNS brass.
They saw some clips
from the pilot and they're rushing
it onto the air.
Yo, we're a
midseason replacement, ordered 12
shows.
We're on in 3 weeks.
Didya
hear what I just said, Yo?
ON DUNWITTY
DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
They didn't even view a rough cut,
just some scenes we quickly cut
together.
ON DELACROIX
DELACROIX
This has to be a big mistake.
DUNWITTY (O.S.)
The big mistake was my not believing
in your genius earlier.
From the
gitgo, from jump street.
DELACROIX
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
HE CLICKS OVER.
DELACROIX (CONT'D)
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of
this other call.
Mantan and Sloan are sitting on a park bench, nothing is
being said.
He sits up and starts to do a dance for her.
To her.
ON BENCH
Mantan is doing that "Mating" tap dance.
SLOAN
Are you trying to seduce me?
He puts his index finger over his mouth - "Quiet."
SLOAN (CONT'D)
You think that's gonna work, huh?
He quickly jumps up on the bench, does some intricate steps
then pulls Sloan up from her sitting position.
ON MANTAN AND SLOAN
They kiss.

Delacroix is driving "down south."
Delacroix is driving on his way to "Ole Virginny."
Delacroix pulls up in the parking lot of a rinky-kink,
funky, greasy BAR/CLUB/BAR-B-Q joint.
CLOSE ON NEON SIGN
"MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK" - most the letters do not light up,
underneath it, "2-NITE - JUNEBUG."
Delacroix knocks.
JUNEBUG (O.S.)
What do you want?
DELACROIX
I want to speak with you.
JUNEBUG (O.S.)
Go away, unless you got my money.
DELACROIX
It's me, Peerless.
Delacroix is driving back home - up North.
Delacroix's car flies past us.
The TRACK is BOOMING.
The fire hydrant is open on this

Mantan and Cheeba gaze skyward at a behemoth billboard for

Some people recognize them and start asking for
autographs and a crowd forms.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It was the rage.
A group of protesters led by the REVEREND JESSE JACKSON and
AL SHARPTON carry signs and banners objecting to Mantan.
They're calling upon the FCC to pull the show off the air
and for the boycotting of the show's two sponsors: TIMMI
HILLNIGGER and DA BOMB MALT LIQUOR.
ON PROTESTERS
The press is watching.
The limo drives past the World Famous Apollo Theatre in

He picks himself up and does a joyous dance.
This is
Manray's dance of Freedom.
ON STREET
The Big Black Chevy Suburban creeps down the alley to a
dancing Manray and comes to rest right in front of him.
Manray tries to shield his eyes from the hi-beam headlights.

The Mau-Mau's are dying laughing.
Manray tries to walk

They block him.
Manray attempts to climb
over the suburban.
He's quickly nabbed, give a good ole
Brooklyn Beatdown, then thrown into the rear of the vehicle.
The Mau-Mau Mobile rolls up to an abandoned factory.
ON CHEVY SUBURBAN
The Mau-Mau's quickly carry Manray out from the back of the

It's a mob scene as the media frenzy heightens.

DELACROIX (V.O.)
Somehow, someway, somebody had

It was a
feeding frenzy.
Delacroix and Cheeba start pushing people out of the way as
they get in to their waiting car.

The Mau-Mau's come out of the factory high as a kite.
Each
