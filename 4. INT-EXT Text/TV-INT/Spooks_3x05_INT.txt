      A clock reads: 0800.  An MI5 Psychologist is talking to a 
      number of new recruits who take copious notes.

      CAPTION: Thames House, MI5 HQ.  New Recruit Orientation.  

                                  PSYCHOLOGIST
                    Working with secrecy means you re 

                    going to be living with secrecy, to 
                    the end of your careers, even the 
                    end of your lives.  The effect on 
                    your relationships outside of this 
                    building is not to be 
                      underestimated.

      A clock reads: 0805.  An OLD TV is on.  A boy band is singing 

      on a kid's Saturday morning show.  We glide past the TV, over 
      discarded clothes to find Zoe and Will on a mattress.  They 
      are making love.  

      Correction.  They are fucking.  A sense of spiritual 
      insistence to it.  Nothing else matters in the world.  

      Zoe, Will and the TV MUSIC climax simultaneously.  The 
      audience of kids on TV erupt in applause and cheers.  Zoe and 
      Will break down in hysterics, as if the cheers are for them.


                                  WILL
                    I just got the urge to dunk you in 

                    the sea.  Let s go to Brighton.


                                  ZOE
                    Yes!
                          (realises)
                    No!  Can t, can t, teaching the 
                    little ones.


                                  WILL
                    You shouldn t have said yes.

                                  ZOE 
                    I know.  

                            (ruminating)
                    I love saying yes.

                    Sorry.  Must train new spies.

                    Must.  Of course.  

      He grabs her and pulls her back to the bed, she tries to 
      protest, but her heart s not in it.

      A clock reads: 0930.  The Psychologist is still talking.

                                  PSYCHOLOGIST 
                    Well, I had asked one of our senior 
                    officers from Section B to speak to 
                    you about this very subject, but...

      Zoe crashes in, blushing.  Grinning.  Post-coitally smug.

                                  ZOE
                    Sorry.  Hello.  Sorry.

                                  PSYCHOLOGIST
                    Zoe.  Would you mind just giving a 
                    few words of advice to our new 
                    recruits?

                                  ZOE

      A ripple of laughter.

                                  PSYCHOLOGIST
                    On the subject of relationships?


                                  ZOE
                    Oh right.  Yes.  
                          (thinks)
                    Hm.  Yes.  Well.  Having a 
                      relationship outside these walls is 
                    almost impossible.  The only people 
                    who can fully understand, or 
                      appreciate, or support you in your 
                    life are the people you share this

      The recruits are rather ashen-faced at this.

                    At least ... that s what people 
                    here will try and tell you.  And I 
                    used to think that too.  But it s 
                    just not true.  You can find

                    call it now.  I know this sounds 
                    stupid, but it's just about meeting 
                    the right person.  And the only way 
                    to do that is to set the bar very 
                    very high.  Because they re going 
                    to need to be fabulous.  Someone

                    Fabulous.

      Some recruits look at her jealously.

      MI5's private firing range.  You don't get weapons this 
      powerful in just any old place.  Danny is here, in visor and 
      earguards.  A Beretta 92F in his LEFT HAND, supported by his 
                                                                                              **

        A supervisor stands nearby behind glass.

                    It's funny, I never ...

      Colin keeps talking as Danny empties the clip at a target.  
      The shots hit the head of the target - but the holes move 
      towards the edge.  The rapport is deafening.  Empty shell 
      casings litter the floor.  We can't hear a word.
                                                                                              *

                    the weekends.

                    Sorry, Colin.  What?

                    I never had you down as a weekend

      A rambling house.  An old REDIFFUSION television is on.  An 
      old 40s B&W movie.  Something with a close up of chaste 
      clinch: "I have to go.  I must."  We take in the clutter, the 
                                                                                              *
      books strewn everywhere, the lush velvet drapes and throws, 
      and a PERSIAN GREY.  

      Ruth is watching, enrapt.  There s tea on a small table.  One 
      cup.  A doorbell chimes.  Ruth looks out of the window to see 
      MALCOLM is out there, loitering furtively.

      She ushers him in - "it's open".  He comes to the living room 
      door and pauses politely.   He's holding a Jiffy Bag.

                                    MALCOLM 
                    I'm off to curling club this

      Ruth turns her attention to the movie.  Malcolm almost bows 
      as he withdraws.  A quite "bye" and he's gone, waving from 
      the window.  Ruth waves and draws the curtains.

      Opens the Jiffy and removes a LARGE DOCUMENT, bound with a 
      bulldog clip.  Starts perusing it, turning the sound down on 
      the movie.

      She tilts her head to one side.  It s almost like she s 
      reading a love letter from an old flame.  We can see the warm 
      glow it stirs within her.  Settles down to read.

      We see the title page:

      He looks into his own eyes.

      Ruth sweats a little as her bag goes through security. She 
      smiles at the security guard.

      The guard nods at her. She takes her bag and walks off, a 
      little relieved.

      Harry is here with Adam and Ruth.  DR. ERIC NEWLAND (50s) on 
      Harry's computer screen.  There's a smug air to his smile.  
      Driven, perhaps.  Intense.  There's a sense here too that

      Danny passes Zoe as she sorts out paperwork.  He nods in 
      greeting, but it's perfunctory.  The chill from Danny is 
      observed by Harry and RUTH, as she leaves his office.  

      RUTH catches up with Danny.

                                  RUTH
                    Um, Danny.  I take it everything's

                    But now, obviously, I'm not.

      Adam approaches Zoe.  Zoe s just connected with someone on 
      the phone, one second ...

                    Hello, who do I talk to about 
                    ordering some flowers please?  It's 
                    for a wedding.  

      Sam walks through with A LARGE BUNCH OF FLOWERS.  Places them 
      in front of Zoe with a knowing look.  Ruth sees it too.  A 
      slight tinge of jealousy.

      Zoe beams when she sees the card - it's from "W".

                    One night on a North Sea ferry.  
                      Punishment enough, surely?

      Her good mood is at odds with the prevailing sense of portent

      Then presses play on the monitor --

      ON SCREEN: We see time-lapse of an animal dying of pneumonic 
      plague.


                                  ADAM
                    Pneumonic plague has a rapid onset, 
                    and most untreated patients die 
                    within 48 hours.  It's zoomorphic, 
                    so it can pass from human to animal 
                    and animal to human.  I mean, it's 
                    been around for a while.  Black 
                    Death and what have you.  Hardly 
                    breaking news.  But Newland is 
                      perfecting a process that could 
                    mass produce and deliver it on to a 
                    large population.

                    It's home-brewed biochemical 
                    warfare and it scares the shite out 
                    of me I can tell you.  

                                  HARRY
                    From what we know Newland is going 
                    to Norway to meet a fixer for North 
                    Korean technology transfer.  The 
                    North Koreans, from what we 
                      understand, want to fund his 
                    research.

                    What a prick.

                                  HARRY
                    He's a free agent and as far as we 
                    can tell he's become so entwined 
                    with his research he's not paying 
                    attention to the consequences.  I'm 
                    a little cautious of bandying the 
                    phrase "renegade scientist" around 
                    but in this case I'm prepared to 
                    make an exception.  Giving North 
                    Korea his kind of expertise is only 
                                                                                              *

                    Any objections?

      Zoe and Danny look at each other and shake their heads.  
      Harry glances out of the window to see Ruth leaving her desk.   
      As Adam moves to leave:

      slightly frayed exchange.

      Ruth is alone.  She looks around, sits herself in a booth, 
      headphones on, clicks "PLAY" on a screen that says: "SOURCE 
      KARL: AUDIO FILE 12/334".  We sense this is a guilty 
      pleasure.  This is not a local library ...

                                  MAN'S VOICE
                    Not like that.  I'm a successful

      An old friend speaks, a sister even.

                    So why is the only thing I think 
                    about these days the only part of 
                    my life I've neglected?

                    leave the radio on when I'm out at

                    some shred of human warmth there to

      Ruth nearly shedding a tear, a tap on her shoulder.

                                  SAM
                    Ruth ...

      Ruth nearly shrieks, turns.  Fumbles with the headphones.  A 
      document spills out from her lap.  

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                          (looks)

                      Housekeeping surveillance, that's 
                    all.  

                                  SAM
                    Oh, okay.

      Ruth looks at Sam.  A barefaced lie to a close colleague.  
      She doesn't like having done it.  Sam lets the silence hang.

                                  RUTH
                    And ... 

      Sam smiles.

      Ruth and Sam chat.  When anyone passes, they lower voices.  
      Ruth holds a printout that features a PHOTO of a MAN (JOHN).

                                  RUTH 
                    It's so embarrassing.

                    He has a PhD in economics.  He was 
                    an athlete at university but he 
                    hurt his knee playing tennis in 
                    Spain in '92.  A ligament.  Very 
                    painful.  And he's a singer.  I 
                    don't know why that should make a 
                      difference to me.  I just ...

      Ruth looks at Sam for a moment - there's the slight feeling 
      from Sam's tone that suddenly puts Ruth on the defensive.

                                  RUTH

      And she leaves.  Ruth turns back to her screen.

      Zoe has cooked Will supper.  They sit and smile, leafing 
      through PHOTOGRAPHS.  Danny walks out of his bedroom and past 
      the counter.

      Will looks at Zoe with a 'does he really hate me?' look.  Zoe 
      shakes her head.  Danny walks back into his bedroom --

1919

      Danny cracks open the beer and sits on the edge of the bed.  
      LAUGHTER AND GIGGLES from the living room.  Danny SLAMS the 
      beer down on the bedside table.  He doesn't pay attention as 
      it FOAMS and "BOILS OVER"...

      Ruth is wearing headphones.  A screen on her computer says: 
       SOURCE KARL -- FEED -- LIVE .  A man called JOHN is 
      speaking, somewhere.  This is SOURCE KARL.

      shines from the kitchen.

      The RADIO can be heard echoing through the house.  It's the 
      SHIPPING FORECAST.  The first word she hears is:

      Is the radio mocking her?

      drunkenly assembling a late night snack after a boozy

      Danny lies awake.  He can hear, vaguely, sounds of Will and 
      Zoe's conversation.  Zoe laughs warmly from through the wall.  
      She sounds happier than we've ever heard her.

      Danny stands there for a second, catching a glimpse of 
      himself in the mirror again.  The eyes.  Torn.  Finally 
      returns to bed.

      Ruth sits down on the comfortable seating along the wall.  
      Dark tables have been laid with white linen.  It s a crisp, 
      intimate restaurant that feels airy.  

      A few moments later, the Maitre D  approaches with a MAN IN A 
      SUIT, he s leading him to the table next to Ruth.

      The MAN is the same man Ruth had a photo of - JOHN.

      He sits down on the bench, the same way as Ruth.  

      Ruth stares straight ahead as he settles.  Her eyes desperate 
      to edge left and lay themselves on this man next to her.

      Her eyes finally stray to his impeccable shoes.  His 
        immaculately tailored trouser leg.  His hands, idly playing 
      with his empty glass.  

      John catches her eye as he looks for a waiter, his face is 
      open, honest, kind.  Handsome.  Ruth looks away immediately.  
      Heart pounding.  She can't believe it.  

      She s about to say something when the waiter arrives again, 
      offers her a basket of bread.  

                                  WAITER

                    Water.

                      Sparkling, please.  With some 
                    lemon.

      Her waiter turns to her neighbour.

                    Something to drink, sir?

                    Sparkling water, with lemon, 
                    please. 

      Ruth gets a thrill.  Waiter departs.  These two are sort of 
      dying to gaze at one another now.  A mobile rings.  John 
      searches for it in his jacket pocket.  His sleeve catches a 
      KNIFE which goes flying onto the floor.

      Ruth and John both reach down.  Ruth realises, pulls back, 
      too late, fingers touch ...  

      Electric.

                                  RUTH

                    anywhere.

      Ruth about to speak when the man s lunch appointment arrives.  
      We might, if we were paying attention, recognise his voice as 
      "BILL".  If not, it doesn't matter.

      And that's that.  But somehow, for Ruth, this is a triumph.  
      Catching her ear.

                    I have decided you're working too 
                    hard and a spot of pro-am Mozart is 
                    just the sort of thing to take your 
                    mind off.  Usual story, turn up, 
                    sing some Mozart, drink some wine.

                    When and where?

                    We went last year and had a blast.  
                    There's hardly any rehearsal.  Turn 
                    up and belt out.  Go on.  Say yes.  

      Bill hands over a SCORE.  Wolfgang Amadeus' best.  Ruth is 
      silently willing Bill to say yes.  Come on, say yes.

                                  JOHN
                    Alright then.  I can always do with 
                    a good scratch.  Particularly where 
                      Wolfgang's concerned.

                                  BILL
                      Excellent.

      Ruth is equally thrilled.  Handsome and a singer ...

      They pass a HEAVY-SET MAN.  Danny doesn't like the look of 
      him at ALL.  He glances back as they pass, paranoid.

      This is a shitty, cramped berth with two fold-down beds.  
      Danny and Zoe enter.  Zoe puts the briefcase down.  Danny 
      stands and stares.

                                  DANNY
                    It's like the Hindenberg but 
                    without the frills.  You should 
                    come here on your honeymoon.  

      Danny grabs the Welcome Pack - map and layout.

                                  DANNY (CONT'D)
                          (reading)
                    Newland's berth is on the other 
                    side of the ship from us.  On the 
                    port, starboard, the other side, 
                    anyway.

                                  ZOE
                    If we moved in next door it might 
                    be a little obvious.

      Zoe looks suddenly queasy.

      Zoe runs to the bathroom and slams the door.

      Ruth back at her desk.  A smile on her face.  Which suddenly 
      becomes a frown as she receives something on her monitor.

      Adam passes.  Catches Ruth's eye.

                                  RUTH
                    Um ... Adam?

      She beckons him subtly towards her: indicating her monitor.

      Harry, Adam & Ruth.

                                  ADAM
                    Why didn't we know this before?

                                  RUTH
                    GCHQ had some problems looking into 
                    the accounts.  There were quite a 
                    few.  

                                  HARRY
                    So money transfer is already 
                      occurring.

                                  RUTH
                    Yes.  

                                  HARRY
                    We know this?

                                  RUTH
                    I mean ...
                          (a mistake)
                    Perhaps.  Is what I meant to say.  
                    Not yes.

                                  HARRY
                    A big difference.

                    You're working on the bank

                    It's a yes.

      Danny at the till. (This could be a supermarket/shop)

                                  DANNY
                    Do you have anything that could 
                    settle my friend's stomach? 

      The assistant turns to search, Danny turns to see Newland 
      himself standing next to him.  Newland helpfully picks up a 
      packet of stomach settlers from the counter and offers them 
      to Danny.

                                    NEWLAND
                    These should do the trick.

      Danny hesitates. Smiles. Then takes them - thanks.

      It's horribly awkward.  The assistant returns.  Danny pays. 
      And goes.  Breathing in deeply.

      Harry stern.  Adam senses the answer to the silent question.

                                  HARRY
                          (reads a fax)
                    "In the light of new developments 
                    we would prefer it if this 
                      individual was no longer a 
                    problem."   The DG's recommendation 
                    memos have started sounding like 
                    Papal Bulls.  I wouldn't mind a 
                    little clarification on this.  

      A look between Adam and Harry.  Harry sighs the sigh of the 
      old warrior, forced once again into the grotty underbelly of 
      his job.  Adam too knows the score.  The mood darkens 
      considerably.  Adam gets a page.  Reads it.  

                                  ADAM
                    Seems clear to me.

                                  HARRY
                    All the same.  It's better if I 
                    hear it from the horse's mouth.

      Sam delivers a file to Ruth.  She opens it, it's a libretto 
      for Mozart's Requiem.

                                  RUTH
                    Oh ... no ...

                    that is, you have to go for it.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                    My point is.  We've all got things 
                    we're scared about.  But doing them 
                    is what makes us feel alive.  When

      Malcolm walks past.  Sees the Requiem libretto.  He starts 
      humming it, almost unconsciously, like he can't help it.

                    Lift the foam, please.

                                  ZOE
                    Harry are you on the line?

                                  HARRY
                    Do as he says, Zoe.

      Zoe lifts the foam.  To reveal a SYRINGE, various PHIALS OF 
      LIQUID ... all sinister paraphernalia of an assassin.

      Zoe, increasingly sick, and increasingly angry.

                                  ZOE
                    Do you have any idea what you're 
                    asking of us? 

                                  ADAM
                      I appreciate how angry you must 
                    feel.

      Harry and Adam stand over the speaker.

                                  ZOE (V.0.)
                    You planned this.  

                                  HARRY
                    Zoe, you have my word.  The case 
                    was a precaution for extreme 
                      circumstance.  Which is where we 
                    now reside.  The decision has been 
                    made.  We have to act.

                    How can this be sanctioned?

                    Newland is involved in the sale of

                    We're nowhere near our rights.

      INTERCUT CONVERSATION:

                                  HARRY
                    We have come to realise that we are 
                    living in a far more dangerous 
                    world, Zoe.  You may have noticed 
                    this yourself.

                                  ZOE
                    It's still not in our policy to do 
                    something like that ...

      Zoe sits down.  Rubs her head.  She's not looking well.

                                  HARRY
                    Deadly force is authorized under 
                    extreme circumstances.  This is one 
                    of them.

                                  ZOE
                    One minute we're going to talk to 
                    him, next we're going to kill him--
                    ?

      She's definitely looking GREEN.

                                  HARRY
                    We did not anticipate the depth and 
                    progress of his actions.

                                  ZOE 
                          (suddenly)
                    I feel sick.

                                  ADAM
                    I know this is a shock --

                                  ZOE
                    No, I mean I really feel sick. I 
                    need some air. 

      She leaves Danny in the cabin.

      Adam shakes his head at Harry. 

                                  ADAM
                    Danny, will you just get Zoe back 
                    on for a second?

6262*

      Danny finds Zoe in a quiet part of the deck of the boat. He 
      hands her the phone.  She looks at Danny, sighs and takes the 
      phone from him.

                                  ZOE
                    This is confirmed?

                    You paused.

                                  ADAM
                    Zoe.  We're sure.  And your 
                    position is clear I'm afraid.  The 
                    task now falls to the senior 
                    officer present.  You.


                                  ZOE 
                    This is not self defence training.  
                    This is not protection.  This is 
                    clinical wet work, Adam.  This is 
                      assassination.  

                                  ADAM
                    You both have medical training.  
                    You can use a syringe.  And I know 
                    you use a firearm.

                                  ZOE
                    I don't know.  

                                  ADAM
                      I appreciate your feelings on this, 
                    don't get me wrong ...

                                  ZOE
                    I really don't know.  I feel 
                    terrible.  I've never been seasick 
                    like this before.  Oh God.

      Danny glares at her.

      Zoe hands the phone to Danny.

                    Going to be sick again. 

      She disappears.  Danny cuts in before Adam can speak.

                                  ADAM 
                    This is going to be hard enough as 
                    it is without proceeding on foreign

                                  DANNY
                    You have to appreciate that what 
                    you're asking is ... more than 
                    we've ever been asked.

                    I don't understand.

                                  ADAM
                    Are you 'on the team'?  Are you in 
                    favour of preventing the kind of 
                    mayhem Newland's knowledge would

                                  DANNY
                    Of course I am.

                    Then I'm sorry to have to say it

                    You're not doing it.  I am.

                    I'm going for a walk.

      Zoe's phone rings immediately.  She waits until Danny's left 
      before answering it - a look between them as he closes the 
      door.  Zoe answers.

                                  ZOE
                    He's gone.  Ring him on his mobile.

                                  DANNY
                    Isn't it?  The taking of human 
                    life.   Thou shalt not kill.   
                    Seems pretty immediate to me.  I've 
                    never had a problem before.  I 
                    really haven't.  Not if I'm around 
                    it or involved in targeting it. 
                          (beat)
                    It's different if you pull the 
                    trigger.

                                  ADAM
                    You and I both know that's true.  
                    Of course.  But at least you've got 
                      experience in this Danny.  At least 
                    this won't be your first time.  

      The truth hitting Danny a bit now ... his stories coming back 
      to haunt him.

                                  DANNY
                    If Gavrilo Prinzip could have seen 
                    what shooting Archduke Franz 
                    Ferdinand would do to the world ... 
                    the Trenches ... the Somme ... you 
                    wonder whether he would have gone 
                    through with it.


                                  ADAM
                    You have to focus on what would 
                    happen if you let this man live.

                                  DANNY
                    What would happen?

                                  ADAM
                    The North Koreans would possess the 
                    means to inflict large-scale 
                      casualties and mayhem on any 
                    country within missile range.

                                  DANNY
                    We can talk him out of it.

                                  ADAM
                    I didn't tell you this before.  But 
                    we've gone down that road with him.  
                    Many times. 

      Big news for Danny.

                                  DANNY
                    Maybe it would have been a good 
                    idea.  To tell us.
                                                                                              *

      Silence for a moment.  We - with Adam - might think Danny's 
      about to chuck it all in.  Finally, soft:

                                  DANNY 
                    So we go again.

                                  ADAM
                    He's made it clear where his 
                    position is.  We have no choice but 
                    to act.

                                  DANNY
                    If it's not Newland, it'll be 
                    someone else.

                                  ADAM
                    Maybe.  But we're concerned with 
                    him.  Our focus is HIM.  Your focus 
                    needs to be HIM.  NOW.

      Danny goes quiet.

                                  ADAM (CONT'D)
                    Danny?

                                  DANNY
                    Give me a minute.

      And he leaves the phone, still connected, on the bed.  Walks 
      over to the bathroom and kicks the shit out of the door. 

      Danny strides back over, picks up the phone.  

                                  DANNY (CONT'D)
                    What do I have to do?  

                                  ADAM
                    We know he's a diabetic.

                    So I'll walk you through it.

      We hear Adam's narration as Danny walks through the steps 
      that will lead to him taking the life of another person.  NB: 
      This is a FLASH FORWARD - Danny's PROJECTION of what will 
      happen.

                                  ADAM (V.O.)
                    The important thing is to make sure 
                    he gets to bed.  Spike his drink, 
                    bribe the bloke behind the bar, do 
                    what you have to do.

      DANNY'S POV:

      As he approaches the door ...

                                  ADAM  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Soon as he's under, asleep, 
                      unconscious, get on with it.  Don't 
                    give yourself any time to get 
                    anxious.  Wear the gloves.  Pick 
                    the lock.  

      We see Danny's hands pick the lock, push open the door ... 
      shutting it behind ... in the darkness ... roving ...

                                  ADAM  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Make yourself at home.

      Danny's POV located a figure under the bed.  

                                  ADAM  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    You want the ankle.  Prime the 
                    syringe before you go in.  

      Danny's hands pull back the sheet - the ankle is BLACK.

                                  ADAM (CONT'D)
                    Swab.  Needle in the vein.  Softly 
                    press the plunger.  The full 
                    contents.  And gone.  Job done.  

      Danny's POV sees the figure in bed.  It's HIM.

      Danny sits sweating on his own, ending the call.  He pulls 
      his knees up to his chest, stress stress stress.

      Ruth packing up to go home.

      Ruth disappears back upstairs.  Sam follows.

      Zoe sits up and sees Danny.  He's just staring at the corner 
      of the table.  Caught up in thought.

                                  ZOE
                    I've defended myself and others, 
                    Danny.  I shot a man but it was

      A long, long silence.  Finally.

                    Yes.  We both have.  You've killed

                    I'm always putting you through 
                    hell.

                                  DANNY
                    No.  No, Zoe.

                                  ZOE
                    If I could ...

                                  DANNY
                    You would.  I know.

      She hugs him.  Danny does not embrace her back.  Already, 
      he's thinking about what he has to do.

                                  DANNY (CONT'D)
                    Get some rest.

      Danny sits in the corner of another 'cafe', where he can see 
      NEWLAND, sitting at the bar, sinking whisky.  


      TIME-LAPSE unfurls - people gradually leave ... until they're

      Sam sits with Ruth.  

                                  RUTH
                    I'm just scared, that's all.  About 
                    what to say.  About what could 
                    happen if I get found out.  I could 
                    lose my job.  I could get arrested 
                    and thrown in prison.  I could go 
                    to Camp X-Ray, you know, I ...

                                  SAM
                    Ruth?

      Ruth looks up at Sam.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                    Shut up.

                    Sam, I need some tips, please, just 
                    anything.

                                  SAM
                    Anything?
                          (thinks)
                    Just play dumb, look impressed and 
                    ask a lot of questions.  Guys love 
                    that.  Okay, here comes camouflage.  

      Sam opens up a case of makeup. It should feel like it could 
      be Danny's preparations for the Big Job, or any spy's prep 
      for that matter.  Lipstick clicked.  Compacts snapped shut.  
      Tools of the trade, as it were.

      Ruth stands in front of Sam.  She looks great.  Sam gives her

      Doorbell goes.  Outside the window, Malcolm can be seen in 
      pinstripe suit.  Looking very dapper.

      Danny and Newland at the bar.  Danny handling both their 
      drinks.   

      CLOSE ON HIS HANDS:  As he drops a small tablet into 
      Newland's drink.  It instantly dissolves.

      BACK TO SCENE


      Danny smiles.  Raises his glass to Newland.
                                                                                              *

                    Good health.  Well, what would you 
                    care about that, being in life 
                      assurance!

      Danny smiles, drinks his whisky down in one.  Newland is 
      about to put his to his lips when he sees Danny's progress, 
      turns to the bartender.  

                                    NEWLAND (CONT'D)
                    One more for my friend here.  He's 
                    on a road to oblivion, I think.  

      He slaps Danny mate-ily on the shoulder.  Danny flinches.

                                  DANNY
                    Aren't we all.

                                    NEWLAND
                    That's your company talking.  

                                  DANNY

      And Newland finally drinks.  Yawns.  

                                    NEWLAND
                    It's why we reproduce, I suppose.  
                    Human beings.  Animals that we are.  
                    We need to further ourselves.  We 
                    can't stand the idea that some day 
                    we won't be here any more.  You 
                    should do a roaring trade on this 
                    tub.  Everyone'll be thinking about 
                    topping themselves before too long.

      Another yawn.  Danny watches him down his drink.  

7878

      Newland fumbles with his swipe card key, clearly exhausted.  
                                                                                              *
      Enters and slams the door behind him.

      PULLING BACK:  In the shadows, there's Danny.  Watching.  A 
      bead of sweat on his brow forming.  


7979

      Danny sits on the bed.  Staring at the briefcase of death in 
      front of him.  

      Zoe lies on the other bed, seemingly asleep.  

      He's very much alone now.  He opens the briefcase.  

      A beat.

      INTERCUT WITH DANNY:

                                  ADAM 
                    Inside you, things'll happen.  It 
                    only really kicks in when you get 
                    home.  First, your legs.  They just 
                    go out from under you.  Then you 
                    puke.  Then you cry like a baby.  
                    And after all that, what I finally 
                    realised was, if I could look 
                    myself in the eyes.  In the mirror.  
                    If I could do that, afterward ... 
                    then I'd be okay.  If you can do 
                    that, I said to myself

                    chances are you'll be alright.  So 
                    I had a little puke, had a little 
                    cry, looked at my reflection and 
                    ...
                          (beat)
                    Well.  Here I am.  
                          (beat)
                    Does that help, Danny?  Please 
                    speak to me.

                    You are going to administer an 
                    overdose of insulin to his ankle.  
                    He won't feel a thing.  

      Danny is silent.

                                  DANNY
                    I've never killed.  Before.

                                  ADAM 
                    I know.  It's okay.

      Again the silence.

                                  DANNY
                    You know?

                                  ADAM 
                    Of course I know, Danny.  Are we 
                    okay?  

                                  DANNY
                    I have to go now.

      Danny hangs up.  Turns to the case once again.  

      And begins preparing the syringe.

      Ruth and Malcolm enter the atmospheric candlelit hall.  They 
      are shown to their respective spots by an usher.  "Singers?  
      this way..."  Malcolm gives Ruth a supportive look as they 
      walk towards the choir.  

8282

      Danny opens the door a crack.  Looks out to the corridor.  
      Seems normal enough.  In his hand, a jacket.  

      Steps out.  Shuts the door behind him.  Sounds from somewhere 
      filter in.  A conversation.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      He rounds a corner, almost bumps into a STEWARD.  Danny 
      sweating.  The steward apologizes, moves off.  

      As he does, we being to hear the haunting first orchestral 
      bars of Mozart's Requiem ...

      Candlelight flickers.  The choir collected in front of an

      We mix the soundtrack across to Danny as the choral parts 
      come in.  Heart pounding as he follows another corridor to 
      the right.  We follow him.  

      Now utterly in the moment, his every movement precise and 
      controlled.  

      People look at him.  Children, up late.  Drunken businessmen.  

      Danny keeps his eyes to the ground. 

      DANNY'S POV:  It's like Adam's walkthrough.  The carpet ahead 
      of him.  A walk of shame?  A dead man walking?

      The door ahead - Newland's cabin.  Approaching slowly.  
        Mercilessly.  

      Four doors to go.  Three ...

      THE DOOR OPENS

      Danny swivels around, nonchalantly walking back the way he 
      came, hoping to God and Country that Newland hasn't seen him.

      BEHIND DANNY:  We can see Newland head off in the opposite 
      direction, still dressed.


      Danny of course cannot see what he's doing and is sweating.  

      Newland goes to the bar and retrieves a couple of bottles of 
                                                                                              *
      Perrier.  Yawning, clearly bleary ... Danny hears the clink 
                                                                                              **
      of the bottles and he's relieved. 
                                                                                              *

      Makes the corner and waits.  

      WE STAY WITH DANNY - NOW UNABLE TO SEE NEWLAND

      Danny examines his watch.  Calculating in his head, he turns 
      and heads away from Newland's berth, back towards the cabin.  

      A SERIES OF SHOTS - DANNY IN HIS CABIN

      Pacing, sweating, looking at his watch ...

8585*

      Another movement of the Requiem in full flow.  Ruth enjoying 
      the singing.  John, in the male section, giving it all he's 
      got.  

8686

      Danny begins to walk back down the corridor on rubbery legs.  
      Regards his watch.  Satisfied enough time has passed.  

      Stewards keep coming back and forth.  Drunken Norwegians.   


      All the while, Requiem reaching depths of portent. 

      Danny reaches the door.  A glance -- left, right.  Clear.

      He removes a small lockbreak device.  Quietly and efficiently 
      dons gloves.  Gains entry.  

      Pushes the door slowly open ... peering in ...

      DANNY'S POV: Hard to tell ... but sounds like all is quiet.

      He pushes the door further open, a small brush of the door on 
      the horrendous carpet.  

8787

      Shutting the door behind him, darkness.  As his eyes adjust 
      to the light - moonlight from the water, through the 
      porthole.  

      It's spacious.  

      Danny quickly locates the bed.  The sleeping form of Newland.  
      Deep breathing.  The drugged drink is working.  

      From under his jacket Danny removes the syringe.  Newland 
      shifts in his sleep.

      Danny pads across the floor.  Moonlight behind Danny casts a 
      shadow across the sleeping man's face.  


      Like the proverbial baby.  

      Danny suddenly struck.  What dreams rove underneath those 
      lids?  Newland smiles in his sleep.  Danny trembling.  

      The lumps at the end of the bed.  The feet.  Come on, Danny, 
      pull yourself together.

      Danny pulls the sheet back gently.

      Newland has surgical travel socks on.  3/4 length.  Tight.

      Oh God.  

      A NOISE OUTSIDE THE DOOR.  Voices.  A conversation.

      Does he have company?  Is he alone?

      A sudden surge of paranoia forces Danny back towards the 
      bathroom.  The voices linger outside the door.  

      Shuffle shuffle shuffle ... the door across the hall.  

      A SLAM.  And quiet once again.  The DRONE of the ferry.  

      Danny moves back to the sleeping form of Newland.  

      Danny moves his gloved hand towards the sock.  With his 
      gloves on he won't be able to get purchase on the sock.  
      Unless... he should just pop the syringe through the sock.

      Decisions, decisions - agony, sweat, nerves - so much he 
      drops the syringe.

      Trying not to swear, bending down to the floor, Newland 
      snorts and snores in his sleep.

      Danny freezes.  Newland merely turning over in his bed. 

      Danny locates the syringe.  

      Suddenly motivated by fear and loathing, Danny approaches 
      Newland's exposed ankle with the syringe ...

      We might hear the "AMEN" of the Requiem as

                                                                  WE CUT AWAY TO:

      End of the candlelit Requiem.  Everyone having white wine.  
      Ruth and Malcolm chat together.  Ruth keeping tabs at all 
      times on John, who is nearby, also looking in their 
      direction.

      Malcolm turns his head, sees John and turns two feet to his 
      left, subtly bringing him into their circle. 

      Ruth eyes John.  Smiles.  John smiles at Ruth.  Malcolm turns 
      to "see", John smiles at him too.

                                  RUTH
                    I'm amazed you find the time for 
                    anything given your schedule.  

                                  JOHN
                    You've just about hit the nail on 
                    the head there.  That's why my 
                    friends put me up to all that 
                    warbling tonight.

                                  RUTH
                    All sounded terrific from where I 
                    was standing.

                                  JOHN
                    So did you.  

                                  RUTH
                    So are you glad ... you came 
                    warbling?

                                  JOHN
                    Oh, very much so.  
                          (takes in the setting)
                    It's lovely.  Isn't it.

                                  RUTH 
                    It is.  I never come down here.  I 
                    live in this city, but I never 
                    really take time to appreciate it 
                    ...

                                  JOHN
                    So true.  No time for culture.  No 
                    time for exercise.  No time for 
                    love.  It's appalling.  


                                  RUTH
                    There's always time for love.  One 
                    should make time. 

                                  JOHN
                    I suppose so.  Though with my 
                    innings so far ... well, anyway.  

                                  RUTH
                    Any major disappointments?
                          (beat)
                    Sorry to be so personal, I didn't 
                    mean to be ...

                                  JOHN
                    Oh, don't worry.  Major ones?  Not 
                    really.  I tried marriage, but that 
                    didn't work.

      She knows this.  What perhaps she doesn't know.

                    Another woman?

                                  JOHN
                    No, actually, another man.  My wife 
                    looked elsewhere.  

      A broken heart in need of mending?  

                                  RUTH
                    I'm sorry.

                                  JOHN
                    She's still with him, actually.  
                    She feels happier, I'm sure.  He 
                    had the passion to make her feel 
                    wanted, I think.  I wonder where 
                    mine went.

                                  RUTH
                    I expect it's never left you.

                                  JOHN
                    Maybe you're right.

      Ruth and John for a second catch each other's eye.  Then look

                                  WILL
                    I don't know how it did but you 
                    have to believe me.  

                                  ZOE
                    My life ... my whole life ... 
                      everything I've dreamed of, worked 
                    for ... depends on the people I 
                    trust not telling things.  
                          (beat)
                    I can't ever trust you.  Again.

                                  WILL 
                    We can work through this.

                                  ZOE
                    No.  

                                  WILL
                    YES.

      He knows that tone of voice.  She's building up ...

                                  ZOE
                    Will.  

                                  WILL
                    Zoe please, don't even think of it.

                                  ZOE
                    It's too late.

                                  WILL
                    Just take a moment, think about 
                    this ... think about us, please ...

                                  ZOE 
                    There is no more us.

                                  WILL
                    Think about what you're saying!

                                  ZOE
                    I am.  Very carefully.

                                  WILL
                    You're not Zoe, you're absolutely 
                    not thinking and not listening 
                    either.


                                  ZOE
                      Everything we had, Will, was built 
                    on that foundation.  Your promise 
                    to me, and my promise to you.  You 
                    just removed everything our future 
                    was ever built on.

                                  WILL
                    It can't end this way.

                                  ZOE
                    It has.

                    Zoe ...

                                  ZOE
                    Never contact me again.  

      And she turns and leaves his life forever.  

      He runs after her, calls down the stairs.

      The front door SLAMS.

      He collapses into a heap on the floor.

      Zoe enters, in pieces.

                                  ZOE
                    Danny?  Danny!

      There's no sound.  She pulls herself together, vaguely.  
      Throws her overnight bag in a corner.  Recalls the messages.

                                    MESSAGE VOICE
                    Hello it's Marcus from Marchmont 
                    Florists, about your order for June 
                    ...

      She slams the machine off.  

      The front door opens and Danny strides in.

                                  ZOE
                    Where have you been?

                                  DANNY
                    I took a walk. 
                          (looks at her)
                    You told him then.

                                  ZOE
                    It's over.

                                  DANNY
                    I'm sorry.

      Zoe is at least expecting a hug but it's not happening.

                                  ZOE
                    That's it?

                    That's it.  

      Zoe watches him walks into the bathroom and SLAM the door 
      shut.

                                  ZOE
                    What happened last night, Danny?  
                    Please.  Tell me.  Tell your 
                    friend.

      Danny sits in the semi-darkness, on the edge of his bed.  His 
      mirror is opposite.  He cannot look at his reflection.

                                  ADAM (V.O.)
                    First, your legs.  They just go out 
                    from under you.  Then you puke.  
                    Then you cry like a baby.  And 
                    after all that, what I finally 
                    realised was, if I could look 
                    myself in the eyes.  In the mirror.  
                    If I could do that, afterward ... 
                    then I'd be okay.  If you can do 
                    that, I said to myself ...


      Danny collapses, pukes, cries.  Then looks in the mirror ... 

                                  ADAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Chances are you'll be alright.

      ... and looks at himself in the eye.
