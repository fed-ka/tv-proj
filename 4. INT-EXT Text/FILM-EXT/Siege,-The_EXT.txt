A coast road. Date palms. Burnt-out hulks that once were
Russian T-54 TANKS have long ago been left to rust in the
sun. A 4-door MERCEDES hurtles down the ancient road.
DEVEREAUX (V.O.)
We're online for exactly two minutes.
A SATELLITE VIEW
Of the same scene. A grainy IMAGE of the car, and some
distance away, a moving cluster of animals. They are:
HERD OF SHEEP
As seen at ground level. Two SHEPHERDS goad them forward. In
the distance, the MERCEDES approaches.

U.S. Army medics and rescue workers frantically sift through

BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD
The Mercedes barrels down the road, doing at least 80 mph.
THE SATELLITE VIEW
Shows that the car is fast approaching the point where the
herd of sheep are about to cross the road.
FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)
Amidst the rubble, the dead are zipped into body bags.
CNN REPORTS (V.O.)
"-- the truck, carrying high
explosives is believed to have hit
the barracks --
BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD
The driver of the Mercedes hits his horn but doesn't slow
down. In addition to the driver and a bodyguard, an OLD MAN
WITH A HENNAED BEARD, a turban, and sunglasses sits in back.
THE SATELLITE VIEW
As the Mercedes closes with the sheep:
DEVEREAUX (V.O.)
Slow down.
BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD
As if on command, the Mercedes finally slows as the sheep
move lazily across the road.
FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)
President Clinton addresses reporters in the White House.
PRESIDENT CLINTON
"To any lengths, anywhere in the
world, to bring these people to
justice."
BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD
Inside the Mercedes, they watch as the Shepherd urinates and
the sheep mill about in the middle of the road. The driver
rolls down his window to scream in Arabic at:
THE POOR SHEPHERD
Who hurries to button his fly. It is only as we look closer
that we see the silenced muzzle of:
COLT COMMANDO RIFLE
Protruding from the sleeve of his jhallabah. And then:
THE HERD OF SHEEP
Fill the frame, blocking our view of the Mercedes, and for a
moment, all we can HEAR is their gentle bleating. But as
they clear frame, we can see that:
THE MERCEDES
Has been turned into an abattoir, its windshield shattered
and bloody. The driver slumps over the steering wheel, the
bodyguard is half out of the window. And in the distance:
WITH A MAGICIAN'S ALACRITY
One Shepherd pulls a BLACK HOOD over the Sheik's head while
the other injects him with a HYPODERMIC. The first Shepherd
activates a SATCHEL CHARGE and swings it into the Mercedes
while the second straps the Sheik into a HARNESS... A BALLOON
self-inflates and hurtles aloft, pulling a cable attached to
the Sheik's harness.
AN MC-130 COMBAT TALON AIRCRAFT
Its "Whiskers" in the nose of the aircraft snag the cable
without slowing and roars off, the Sheik dangling unconscious
beneath -- just as the satchel charges EXPLODE the Mercedes.
THE SATELLITE VIEW
Records impassively for a moment, then breaks up into static.
DEVEREAUX
Gotcha.
IN A SAFE HOUSE -- SOMETIME LATER
A pale, diminished Sheik sits at a steelcase table. A STEEL
COT and a STEEL TOILET. Closed-circuit cameras in the corner.
Opposite him: the man, whose voice we have only heard: GENERAL
WILLIAM DEVEREAUX -- and though he wears a civilian suit,
his bearing betrays his pedigree. His considerable charm and
habitual skepticism are as much a product of self-discipline
as his close-order drill.
DEVEREAUX
Nobody knows you're here. Not your
people. Not even my President. You'll
die here alone and be buried unknown --
barring some miracle.
The SHEIK speaks a few words in Arabic.
DEVEREAUX
-- God? GOD?
(looks at him)
What you eat. Whether you eat. Sleep.
Pain. Absence of pain. I decide. I
make the day and the night. Even the
way you got here -- a hand that
reached down from the sky?
(looks at him)
God? I am your new God.

HUB

FRANK
They told me to call State.
HUB
Don't you just love government?
THE EXPLOSION
Is only the BUS backfiring. PEDESTRIANS who have thrown

Laughing. Only Hub and Frank are not laughing.

Guys... GUYS...
EVERYBODY'S talking at once. In frustration, Hub covers a
microphone with his hand. The FEEDBACK silences the room.
HUB
Sorry. From now on, we will raise
our hands and wait to be called on --
An appreciative chuckle. Hub points to A MAN IN A SUIT.

Thank you, sir. And to everyone else
for their patience today. These are
extremely difficult times -- London,
Paris, we're not the first city to
have to deal with this.
He pauses a moment, searching for the words.
HUB
In Tel Aviv, the day after they blew
up the market, the market was full.
(looks out at them)
This is New York. We can take it.
And then two hundred BEEPERS all go off at once. Everyone
looks at one another. Dear God, what now...
A GRAINY BLACK & WHITE VIDEO IMAGE
Kids, huddled in a corner, crying. A dead mom. The legs of
what we imagine is the terrorist. We are in:
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- AN UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
Hub huddles with other agents behind a makeshift blast-
barricade of desks and tables. Sharon kneels beside them.
DANNY
-- one of the moms was carrying a
piece, wounds the guy as he's planting
the device. He kills her and locks
them all in.
(points at video)
Up there in the corner... by the
clock.
The probe is a hot-head, "arthroscopic" video camera.
DANNY
-- It's got a timer on it only we
don't know how much time is left.
As Hub stares at the horrifying image, the WHITE-NOISE returns
and begins to GROW in his head.
HUB
Closer on the timer.
TECHNICIAN
I'm trying but the angle's wrong...
The NOISE in Hub's head continues to grow. And then suddenly
it is compounded by the SOUND of an APPROACHING CHOPPER --
as an NYPD SWAT HELICOPTER lowers itself into view.
FRANK
What the fuck is the NYPD doing here?!
DANNY
I don't know. Somebody must have --
FRANK
-- WE'VE RUN DRILLS ON THIS
JURISDICTION BULLSHIT SINCE --
DANNY
I KNOW --! YOU THINK I --
HUB
QUIT BICKERING AND FIX IT!
In the HELICOPTER -- a Marksman raises a sniper's rifle.
THE WHITE NOISE
Is screaming now in Hub's head. Unimaginable. Unbearable.
DANNY
(on his radio)
NYPD SWAT, this is the FBI. Get that
bird the fuck out of there!
The SOUND of the CHOPPER and the WHITE NOISE drown him out.
ON THE VIDEO MONITOR
Children are SCREAMING without sound. Even the chopper is
drowned out by the WHITE NOISE.
IN THE CHOPPER
The MARKSMAN takes careful aim --
IN THE CLASSROOM
The TERRORIST grabs a child as a human shield. Hub closes
his eyes to the imminent nightmare, and then:
SUDDENLY, WITHOUT WARNING --
He takes off, barreling down the hall, toward the locked
door of the classroom.
THE DOOR SPLINTERS
He flies through it, firing, hitting the TERRORIST twice.
AN EXPLOSION
Much like the first one on Bus 99. Hub throws himself over
several SCREAMING CHILDREN. And for a moment we don't know
if they'll live or die, until:
BLUE PAINT covers them all. Agents pour in, followed by
Sharon. There, on the floor, holding as many weeping children
as he can:
HUB
Who, unable to keep up the facade for a single second more,
is also weeping now. Weeping for the victims of the bombings,
weeping for the children who've survived, weeping for himself.
And for a moment, everyone just... stands there, vaguely
embarrassed, and more than a little moved.
Hub, who sits in a beat-up old car, a baseball cap worn
backwards on his head. He keys his radio.
HUB
All Units, report in turn. If talking
will reveal your position, just key
your walkie...
AN OLD WAREHOUSE -- RED HOOK
Inside, an AUTO GARAGE. Hoists, compression cylinders,
archwelders. Outside, two WINOS share a bottle by the curb.
A BEAT-UP DODGE drives up. In it, two scruffy-looking Black
MEN. Upon close inspection we realize that one is Hub. The
other is Floyd.
HUB
(to a mechanic)
Yo...
The mechanic looks out from under a car. He's Hispanic.
MECHANIC
Que Pasa?
HUB
Tariq around?
The mechanic gestures to a partitioned-office in the back.
As Hub heads toward it, he checks out the other workers: a
teenager doing a compression check, another fixes a tire.
IN THE OFFICE
Tariq is on the phone talking in Arabic as Hub enters.
HUB
Tariq?
Tariq holds up a finger, hold on. Hub sits opposite him.
TARIQ
How can I help you.
HUB
You're Tariq Husseini?
TARIQ
He's out.
HUB
Damn. Do you think you could give
him a message?
TARIQ
Of course.
HUB
Tell him the FBI is after him.
TARIQ
You're joking.
HUB
Very... slowly... put your hands on
top of the table.
Tariq notices that Hub's hands are out of sight beneath the
table. Hub draws back the slide of his the weapon with an
audible CLICK. Tariq mutters a CURSE in Arabic.
HUB
That wouldn't be a racist epithet,
now would it? Stand up.
As Tariq stands, Hub crosses behind him, kicks out his legs,
pats him down, and cuffs him.
MEANWHILE -- IN THE WAREHOUSE
The two winos have revealed themselves as shotgun-wielding
FBI agents and are now ROUSTING the garage workers.
HUB
Where are the others?
TARIQ
What others?
But before Hub can answer, an AMPLIFIED VOICE is heard.
PSY-OPS (V.O.)
Tariq Husseini, this is the United
States Army. You are surrounded.
Hub is as surprised as Tariq.
PSY-OPS
You have thirty seconds to throw out
any weapons and exit the premises
with your hands on top of your head.
One of the agents with the shotgun calls out.
SHOTGUN AGENT
-- Sir?
HUB
Do as he says.
As Hub hustles Tariq to his feet, the other agents start to
hustle the workers out of door, when:
THE YOUNG MECHANIC
Reaches into his overalls.
SHOTGUN AGENT
FREEZE--!
But when the Mechanic pulls his hand out from his overalls,
all he is holding is the pin to a GRENADE.
THE EXPLOSION
Kills both the FBI agents and their prisoners. Hub throws
Tariq to the ground.
FROM AN UPPER WINDOW
An AUTOMATIC WEAPON opens fire on the Army presence.
HIGH ABOVE -- IN A CHOPPER
Devereaux responds with a dispassionate intensity.
DEVEREAUX
Code blue.
His order unleashes an overwhelming display of FIREPOWER.
INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE
Hub and Tariq crawl for cover as windows EXPLODE, walls are
SHREDDED, and incendiary TRACER rounds mix with solvents and
gasoline to start a conflagration. With the vaguely
hallucinatory quality of the S.L.A. shootout, WHITE NOISE
bleeds in and ALL SOUND FADES OUT:
AN M-60 TANK (SILENT)
Races in from around the corner, only to be hit by A ROCKET-
PROPELLED GRENADE fired through the second floor window.
Hub and Frank hit the street at a dead run.
BENEATH THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE
Samir opens a padlocked door with a key. He and Sharon
disappear within.
A HAMMAM
An Arab bath-house. Rays of sunlight play off the steaming
waters. Their footsteps ECHO off the tiled mosaic walls.
Sequence omitted from original script.
IN THE BATHOUSE
Samir kneels to touch the steaming water.
ELISE
How soon are they coming?
SAMIR
They'll be here.
He starts taking off his clothes.
ELISE
What are you doing --?
He finishes disrobing.
NAKED
He steps into the bath. With a sponge he washes his body.
SAMIR
What message do you have for them,
Sharon?
ELISE
I'll tell them when they're here.
The DISTANT SOUND of the approaching MARCH echoes off the
tiled walls as Samir steps out of the purifying waters and
takes a towel from a hamper.
ELISE
Nobody else is coming, is there?
SAMIR
That's right.
From the hamper he takes a Sig-Sauer .9 automatic.
ELISE
You're the last cell.
SAMIR
There will never be a last cell.
(racks the slide of
the .9)
You should listen to the young men
in that stadium. It is just beginning.
Sharon watches, in dread fascination, as he takes a white
egyptian-cotton FUNERAL SHROUD and drops it over his head.
THE MARCHERS
Are streaming down the street.
Hub and Frank desperately fight their way through a wild,
almost "carnival" feel.
BACK TO -- THE BATHS
Reflected in the purifying waters, Samir is putting civilian
clothes on over the shroud -- still holding the .9 on Sharon.
ELISE
How could I have missed the play --
SAMIR
(a forgiving gesture)
It was the money. You believe money
is power. Belief is power.
ELISE
-- Just tell me we didn't finance
your operation...
SAMIR
(a sad smile)
The world is a wheel. So... what
message do you have for me, Sharon?
ELISE
They're going to release him.
SAMIR
Praise God. When will he be free --?
ELISE
A few months at most. First, they
have to bring him to trial, but --
He turns away from her, opening the hamper.
SAMIR
(not looking at her)
-- No.
ELISE
-- But... that's what you want, isn't
it? Why you've done all this --
BELT OF SEMTEX EXPLOSIVES
Comes next. Velcro straps fasten the belt around his chest.
SAMIR
No. It's not.
He comes to stand beside her.
SAMIR
I want you to bleed... as we have
bled.
ELISE
Samir, the Koran preaches --
SAMIR
Do not speak to me of the Koran,
woman.
(fighting his emotion)
You take our leader. A holy man. You
put him in prison for preaching the
word of God. You must learn the
consequences of trying to tell the
world how to live.
ELISE
(with rising terror)
But it's over, your point's been
made, why spill any more blood? Those
poor people out there in the street,
they're fucking marching for your
cause...
SAMIR
Yes.
(fastens the last
strap on his semtex
harness)
And they, too, will become its
martyrs.
A VOICE from the top of the stairs:
HUB (V.O.)
Let her go and you'll live.
Samir looks up, sees Hub aiming his .45. But Sharon is between
them, blocking his shot.
From outside, we HEAR the sound of the marchers' CHANTING,
"No Fear...! No Fear...!" Samir HEARS it, too.
SAMIR
Move away from the door.
ELISE
NO --!!!
HUB
Let her go and you'll live --
ELISE
DON'T --!!!!
SAMIR
(screaming, panicked)
GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR --!!!
HUB
SAMIR --!
SAMIR
YOU WANT TO DIE --!!
They're all SCREAMING at once. Still Samir keeps inching
toward the stairs. Hub blocks the way.
HUB
No way you're going out there.
Samir jams the gun into Sharon's ribs.
SAMIR
MOVE AWAY --!
Sharon's eyes meet Hubs'.
ELISE
Shoot.
HUB
Shut up.
ELISE
Shoot.
HUB
SHUT UP...
Samir is edging ever closer. Starting up the stairs. Sharon's
eyes plead with Hub, begging for a kind of unholy redemption.
ELISE
SHOOT ME --!!!
HUB
I... CAN'T --!
ELISE
YOU HAVE TO.
(weeping now)
You... promised...
Hub's finger tightens on the trigger. But then slowly, almost
imperceptibly at first, he lowers his gun.
ELISE
(sobbing)
No --!!!
SAMIR
It is God's will.
His left hand moves imperceptibly toward the RIPCORD of the
explosive device.
HUB
If there is a God, he weeps at the
crimes we commit in his name.
HIS FIRST SHOT
Rips through Sharon into Samir, blowing them both backwards.
HIS SECOND SHOT
Is to Samir's hand as it reaches for the ripcord.
THE THIRD SHOT
Is a killing headshot. Rolling him into the baths.
CLOUD OF BLOOD
Blooms in the cleansing water. The funeral shroud billows.
THE ECHO OF THE SHOTS
Still rings in the tiled room as Hub kneels beside Sharon.
HUB
(on radio)
Officer down. OFFICER DOWN --!
ELISE
Is... he... dead?
HUB
...Shhhhhhh...
ELISE
(whispers)
...no... regrets...
Hub cradles her head.
HUB
You... knew.
ELISE
(the saddest smile)
I... wondered.
FRANK HADDAD
Appears at the top of the steps. Behind him, two PARAMEDICS
race down to kneel beside Sharon. Hub is pushed aside as
they begin triage -- but it doesn't look good as suddenly,
she begins to convulse.
HUB
Sharon... SHARON --
ELISE
... Emma... My name... is Emma.
And then she begins to mumble, at first incoherently, and
then more clearly. We realize she's speaking Arabic.
HUB
-- what are you? I don't...
And then Frank is standing above them. Tears in his eyes.
FRANK
(translating)
"I... seek refuge... king of kings..."
And Hub suddenly understands: she is preparing for her own
death. He holds her as she continues to pray in and out of
her two native tongues. Until, at last:
SHARON/EMMA
(whispers)
Allah Ahkbar. God is great --
FRANK
Allah Ahkbar --
HUB
Amen.
And she's gone.
OUTSIDE IN THE STREETS -- MOMENTS LATER
A block away, we can see the Marchers pass by. The chant of
"No Fear..." fades into the distance. But Hub has already
turned his back and is hurrying away.
CUT TO:
Hub hurries toward the Courthouse.
MOMENTS LATER - IN THE COURTHOUSE
JUDGE FRANKEL opens the door. He is taken aback by the blood
on Hub's clothes.
HUB
I want to talk about a free society.
BACK TO:
THE STADIUM COMMAND POST
Where Devereaux is watching coverage of the march.
TV SOUND BITE (V.O.)
-- "a very moving moment in which
the people of a city step forward to
declare their courage and solidarity --
He looks up to see Hub. He's carrying the ACCORDION FILE
that the Chief of Staff gave him.
DEVEREAUX
Agent Hubbard, do you want to tell
me exactly what you mean detaining
Colonel Hardwick and six of my CID
staff. Because that strikes me as a
very peculiar idea of interagency
liaison.
HUB
The last cell has been taken down.
It was Samir. I took him out.
DEVEREAUX
What makes you so sure he was the
last cell?
HUB
Sharon.
DEVEREAUX
Sharon is not trustworthy.
HUB
Sharon is dead. She gave her life.
(takes a piece of
paper from his pocket)
This is a writ from the US District
Court releasing all those being held
here without habeus corpus.
DEVEREAUX
My authority supersedes the civilian
judiciary under the decree of martial
law.
(a rueful smile)
Sorry.
HUB
Your authority ends now. It's all
over.
DEVEREAUX
What's over.
HUB
(looks at him)
They're going to release him.
DEVEREAUX
Release him?
HUB
The Sheik.
(holds up the Chief
of Staff's' file)
Clear violation of international
law, Congressional oversight statutes,
a couple of treaties, the Federal
perjury statute, and my favorite,
the Logan Act, for conducting your
own personal foreign policy.
(simply)
I know the whole story, General.
DEVEREAUX
You don't know shit. Poor suffering
Sharon and her poor suffering people.
It's called "going native" -- the
most elementary error of an
intelligence operative and she made
it. She had all of you working for
her and she was working for them
without even knowing it. And now
they're getting exactly what they
want, which is the Sheik will be
back in the mix. But ten times as
strong, because now he's the big man
who stood up to the Americans.
(looks at Hub)
I did what was necessary. I make no
apologies. If you think you're going
to be able to use that file against
me, you know even less about politics
than I imagined.
HUB
General. I'm not in politics. You
can have this back. I won't use it.
Hub hands him the file. Devereaux takes it.
DEVEREAUX
Because you don't have the balls.
(off Hub's look)
Did you expect me to get all weepy
with gratitude? You serve your
country.
(dismissively)
Is there anything else?
Hub would love to just... clock him. Instead:
HUB
I said I wasn't in politics. I'm
not. I'm in law enforcement.
He takes his gun from its shoulder holster.
HUB
William Devereaux, you are under
arrest for the torture and murder of
Tariq Husseini under color of
authority, United States Code Title
42, Chapter 21, Subchapter 1, Sections
1983.
(takes out his gun)
Surrender your weapon.
Behind them, a COMMOTION as Frank and several agents force
their way into the room, followed by REPORTERS, who shout
questions as STROBES and VIDEOTAPE record the arrest.
OUTSIDE THE STADIUM
An NYPD car -- Devereaux within, pulls away, lights flashing.
HUNDREDS OF YOUNG ARAB BOYS
Emerge from tunnel and into the waiting arms of their mothers,
the tearful smiles of their wives and children. Hub and Frank
stand there, watching the reunions.
FRANK
(after a moment)
Did we win or did we lose --?
Hub has no answer. No one has the answer.
