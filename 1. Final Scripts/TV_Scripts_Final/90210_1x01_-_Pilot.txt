  EXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - TWILIGHT

  TIGHT on a KANSAS license plate.  WIDEN TO REVEAL an older 
  minivan that s been driven hard for last two days passing the 
  iconic BEVERLY HILLS SIGN.


  INT. MINIVAN - MOVING - TWILIGHT

  HARRY MILLS (40, fun dad, but tough when he needs to be) is 
  driving with his wife CELIA MILLS (40, athletic, naturally-
  pretty) and their teenage children, ANNIE (16, pretty, level-
  headed, smart) and DIXON MILLS (African-American, 16, handsome, 
  a leader).

                                  HARRY
                    How cool is this?  Palm trees, Star 
                    Maps, Rodeo Drive...

                                  DIXON
                    It s going to suck.

                                  CELIA
                    How about a new word Dixon? Like 
                     this blows  because you ve been 
                    saying this sucks for the past 1800 
                    miles.  

                                  HARRY
                    Guys. This is where we re at. Look, 
                    your mother and I gave up a lot for 
                    this move too.

                                  ANNIE
                    Really?  Did you give up a 
                    boyfriend and the lead in a school 
                    play?

                                  HARRY
                    As a matter of fact I did.  His 
                    name was Joshua and the play was 
                     Fiddler on the Roof.   

  The kids start to laugh.

                                  DIXON
                    Such a dork. 

                                  HARRY
                    Look, we had no idea Grandma was 
                    going to get into trouble again.

                    She s too old to be drinking and 
                    falling without any of us around to 
                    help. 

                                  CELIA
                    So let s just make the best of it, 
                    okay?

                                  DIXON
                    As I said.  It s going to--

                                  CELIA
                    Dixon!

                                  ANNIE
                    Suck.

  The U-Haul turns up Rexford into the Beverly Hills flats.


  EXT. TABITHA MILLS HOME, BEVERLY HILLS FLATS - EVENING

  The Mills family climbs out of the minivan.  They stretch and 
  begin gathering on the lawn.

                                  DIXON
                          (to Annie)
                    Did I tell you I saw one of 
                    Grandma s old movies last week on 
                    Showtime?  Full frontal. Yikes.

  ANGLE ON Harry and Celia.

                                  HARRY
                    Can I just say that you re handling 
                    this move awfully well for someone 
                    who s never left the state of 
                    Kansas.

                                  CELIA
                    I think it s going to be fun.  Come 
                    on, I m 40, if I don t try 
                    something new, when will I?  I was 
                    going to start working again, why 
                    not in LA?

                                  HARRY
                    You re not just saying that to make 
                    me feel better?     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           3.


                                  CELIA
                    Not at all.  I get to move in with 
                    my bitter, bossy alcoholic mother-
                    in-law who still thinks she s a sex 
                    siren of the 1970 s, what could be 
                    better than that?

                                  HARRY
                    There s my girl.

  The front door opens and TABITHA MILLS emerges with her tumbler 
  and cigarette in hand.  ANNIE lights up at seeing her.

                                  ANNIE
                    Grandma!

                                    TABITHA
                    Annie!  Dixon.

  Annie rushes up to Tabitha and embraces her.  Dixon gives her  a 
  hug, they head inside. Harry approaches, frowns at the tumbler 
  of copper liquid in her hand.

                                  HARRY
                    What you got there, Mom?

  Harry takes the glass from Tabitha s hand, gives it a sniff. 
  Tabitha rolls her eyes.

                                    TABITHA
                    You got me. I m drinking iced tea 
                    before noon.  Somebody get Betty 
                    Ford on the line.

                                  HARRY
                    Sorry, I m just trying to help.

                                    TABITHA
                    You want to help?  Go yell at the 
                    gardener for parking his crappy van 
                    in front of my house again.

                                  CELIA
                    That s our van, Tabitha.

                                    TABITHA
                    Well then park it around the corner 
                    so the neighbors won t notice.

  HARRY is driving Annie and Dixon to school on their first day.      "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           4.


                                  HARRY
                    Look, I know this isn t easy.  
                    You re not just the new kids, 
                    you re the new principal s kids. 

                                  ANNIE
                    A two-fer.  Yay for us!

                                  HARRY
                    And I m sorry you re coming into 
                    school a week after its already

                                  DIXON
                    Yeah, yeah.  Okay, Stop the car. 
                    Stop the car.

                                  HARRY
                    What?

                                  ANNIE
                    You just said it.  We re the 
                      principal s kids.  We can t drive 
                    into school with the principal!

                                  DIXON
                    We ll walk from here.

                                  HARRY
                    The lot is half a mile away, let me 
                    at least get a little clo--

                                  ANNIE
                    Stop it.

                                  DIXON
                    Pull over.

                                  ANNIE
                    Now.  Dad.  Please.  We know what 
                    we re doing


  EXT. WEST BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT

  Annie and DIXON walk and stare in amazement at not only the 
  multitude of ESCALADES, PORSCHES, etc., but the entire place 
  looks like Fashion Week in NYC.

                                  DIXON
                    Oh my god. Have you ever seen so 
                    many hot girls in your life?      "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           5.


                                  ANNIE
                    This is how they dress for school?  
                    It looks like the Oscars and 
                    everyone is Gywneth Paltrow.

                                  DIXON
                    I d do her.  I d do her.  I d do 
                    her.  Annie.  We are definitely not 
                    in Kansas anymore.

                                  ANNIE
                    I m 110 pounds and I m going to be 
                    the fat girl.

                                  DIXON
                    At least you re not going to be the 
                     black guy.   

                                  ANNIE
                    Don t throw the race card at me.  
                    Last year our school play was  A 
                    Raisin in the Sun.   I played a 
                    tree.

                                  DIXON
                    On the other hand that makes me 
                    forbidden fruit.

                                  ANNIE
                    I so should have gone to Banana 
                    Republic!

                                  DIXON
                    I ll find ya at lunch.

                                  ANNIE
                    Yeah, great.  I ll be the girl in 
                    the potato sack practicing my lines 
                    for  Hairspray. 

  Dixon heads across the lot while Annie continues on.  Annie 
  looks at the text she just received. It s from Jason.   Luv u.  
  Miss u. J   She starts to answer when she hears a pulsating beat 
  coming from an Escalade.  

  Annie looks over and makes eye contact with the hot guy in the 
  driver s seat, ETHAN WARD (16, The kid tapped by the magic wand. 
  Handsome, charming, etcetera,).  Ethan gives her a flirty smile 
  and Annie smiles back bashfully until a HEAD POPS UP into view 
  from ETHAN S LAP.  

  It is ADRIANNA, (16, hot without a hair out of place) but before 
  she can see who Ethan is looking at, Annie ducks behind a car 
  out of embarrassment.       "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           6.


  Ethan taps Adrianna s head and she disappears again to go back 
  to her business below the window line.  Annie peaks to look 
  again and Ethan gives her a smile and a wave.

  Harry Mills walks with KELLY TAYLOR (you know her, you love 
  her), a teacher.

                                  HARRY
                    So what year did you graduate?

                                  KELLY TAYLOR
                    All I ll admit to is that I m 
                    younger than you.  So tell me, how 
                    weird is it being the principal at 
                    your old high school?

                                  HARRY
                    Probably about as weird and 
                    stressful as you teaching at it. 

                                  KELLY TAYLOR
                    Nah, not even close.  The last two 
                      principals both had heart attacks. 
                    Anyway, have a great first day.


  INT. WEST BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

    Rehearsals are underway for the fall musical, SPRING AWAKENING.  
  On stage, girls in skimpy half-shirt dance-wear are watching as 
    good-looking boys are performing the upbeat  The Bitch Of 
  Living.   They are very good.  Annie approaches the stage to 
  watch the performance, in shock at the talent level.

                    Yes, yes. Welcome! Your father told 
                    me you were a theater nerd. That s 
                    awesome.  He said you had a DVD of 
                    your show from last spring.  I d 
                    love to see what they do in

                    Well, unfortunately all of the 
                    roles are filled.  We audition 
                    before school starts so we can hit 
                    the ground running.  But you should 
                      definitely sign up for drama class.  
                    It s fun and we definitely need 
                    help with the scenery.

  Annie sighs...

  Dixon enters. The class skews a bit  nerd.  They glance up, eye 
  Dixon in his Kansas City Chiefs jersey. Definitely not a nerd. 
  They shoot furtive glances at each other.  There s a bit of 
  whispering.

  Dixon takes one of the many available seats away from the 
  others, but he s very aware of the consternation he s causing. A

                    No. We don t bowl.

                    I can t believe he just said that.

  The TARDY BELL RINGS and a NERD OF A TEACHER enters and closes 
  the door. He also reacts when he sees Dixon.

                    Uh, hello there, son. Are you sure 
                    you re in the right place? This is

  Dixon sighs.

                    I tried to tell him.

  Suddenly, we hear standard NEWS INTRO MUSIC.

                    Can we settle the who s-supposed-to-

  This is NAVID SHIRAZI. In this nerd universe, he is king.

  INT. WEST BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

  We are now with Annie in her class watching the monitor.  The 
  teacher, RYAN MATTHEWS (25, cool, sarcastic, think Ryan Gosling) 
  turns the TV off.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Alright, so obviously let s give a 
                    warm West Beverly welcome to our 
                    newest student, Annie Mills.

  There is a smattering of applause.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           9.


                                  RYAN MATTHEWS (CONT D)
                    Come on. You guys can do better 
                    than that.

  The class claps louder.  They love their teacher.  GEORGE EVANS, 
  lacrosse rich boy and general asshole coughs out...

                                  GEORGE EVANS
                    Narc. 

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Good job, George.  Now there s 
                    another girl who will never go out 
                    with you.  

  The class laughs at George.  ANNIE appreciates the rescue.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS (CONT D)
                    And who knows? Maybe you re the 
                    narc trying to pin it on someone 
                    else.

  The class chants  Narc  at George.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS (CONT D)
                    Anyway, since Annie is coming in 
                    after the first week, I thought we 
                    would help her get acclimated by 
                    assigning her a friend.  A Beverly 
                    Buddy if you will.

  At that moment, NAOMI BENNETT, (16, West Beverly Hills High 
  icon) enters.  She s dressed to the nines and loves an entrance.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS (CONT D)
                    Whoa.  What a surprise.  Hi Naomi.  
                    Glad you could join us because I 
                    think you would be a great Beverly 
                    Buddy for Annie.

                                  NAOMI
                    Is that one of those Special Ed 
                    kids again?  If so. Not interested. 
                    That kid broke my purse.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    I warned you about keeping 
                    chocolate in there.  Look you re 
                    the queen of the school and you can 
                    show Annie the ropes, maybe even 
                    invite her to that big birthday 
                    bash of yours this weekend so she 
                    can make some friends.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           10.


  Naomi glares at Mr. Matthews.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS (CONT D)
                    Oh and how s that paper coming 
                    along?

                                  NAOMI
                    Oh I m all over it.

  The class laughs.


  INT. WEST BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY

  Naomi walks up to Annie.

                                  NAOMI
                    Look, I m sure you re really nice 
                    and all that, but you can find your 
                    way around without me.

                                  ANNIE
                    Totally, I don t need a Beverly 
                    Buddy.

                                  NAOMI
                    And the party, that s not going to 
                    happen either.  No offense, I just 
                    don t know you.

                                  ANNIE
                    Of course.  That was just the 
                    teacher trying to be nice.

                                  NAOMI
                    That was the teacher being a dick.  
                    He hates me, he s trying to pile 
                    work onto me when he knows I have 
                    my party this week.  But my mom and 
                    dad are going to get his ass fired.  
                    My mom used to date the new 
                    principal in high school before she 
                    dumped him for my dad. 

                                  ANNIE
                    Your mom dated the new principal?

                                  NAOMI
                    Oh yeah.  Total dork.  

  Naomi exits around the corner and Annie sees the SIGN UP SHEET 
  for SPRING AWAKENING stagehands.  She moves to sign up.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           11.


                                  ETHAN (O.C.)
                    That s not going to be an easy  A  
                    ya know...Adrianna will make you 
                    her slave. 

  Annie turns around and sees Ethan.  She blushes.

                                  ANNIE
                    Oh, I... Just--

                                  ETHAN
                    I m Ethan.

                                  ANNIE
                    Annie.  Who s Adrianna?

                                  ETHAN
                    I think you know her.  Adrianna, 
                    she s going to help out with the 
                    play.

  Adrianna comes over to Ethan and gives Annie the once over.  
  Annie realizes that Adrianna doesn t recognize her from the 
  parking lot fellatio.

                                  ANNIE
                    I wanted to audition but I guess I 
                    moved here too late.  So next 
                    Spring--

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Who s your agent?

                                  ANNIE
                    Agent? Um. I don t have--

                                  ADRIANNA
                    How embarrassing. Anyway, maybe one 
                    of the 818 s will cover you if you 
                    drop some weight.  Of course it 
                    will be hard to get noticed in the 
                    chorus.

                                  ANNIE
                          (friendly)
                    Well then I guess I ll have to be 
                    one of the leads.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Hey, good luck with that.

  Naomi spies Ethan and rushes over.  She gives him a long kiss. 
  Annie starts putting it all together.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           12.


                                  NAOMI
                    Where have you been?  I was late 
                    for homeroom looking for you.

                                  ETHAN
                    Just getting my lacrosse stick 
                    waxed.  Got tryouts later.

                                  NAOMI
                    Well, don t get so focused on your 
                    stupid lacrosse that you forget 
                    about me.  

  Naomi leans in to kiss Adrianna.

                                  NAOMI (CONT D)
                    How was rehearsal?

                                  ADRIANNA
                    I was like ten minutes late and 
                    Miss Austin made this BFD about it.

                                  ETHAN
                    Annie, this is Naomi.  My 
                      girlfriend.

                                  NAOMI
                    We ve met.  And Ethan and I are 
                      practically engaged. So look and 
                    admire, but don t touch or I will 
                    have you killed.

  Annie steals a quick look at Adrianna who has looked away.  
  Ethan caught Annie looking.

                                  ETHAN
                    It s good to be loved, huh, Annie?

  The bell rings.  Everyone goes off to class, the halls empty, 
  leaving Annie alone.  A teacher comes up to her.

                                    TEACHER
                    Are you lost?

                                            ACT TWO


  INT. WEST BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL S OFFICE - DAY

  Two polished forty-something s wearing ten grand in casual wear 
  sit in office chairs. This is MR. AND MRS. BENNETT, Naomi s 
  parents.

                                    CHARLES BENNETT
                    --I know it s been a while since we 
                    went here, Harry, but I seem to 
                    recall the teachers  job was to 
                    enable the kids, not obstruct them--

  Harry sits beside Kelly Taylor and Ryan Matthews. 

                                  HARRY
                    Mr. Matthews wasn t obstructing 
                    Naomi, Charlie.  He s making sure 
                    she does her assignment like all--

                                    CHARLES BENNETT
                    --can I finish? And it s Charles, 
                    now. We re not kids anymore. For 
                    this young punk to threaten Naomi 
                    with an incomplete and for her 
                    advisor Ms. Taylor to back him is 
                    absurd.  It s one paper, it can t 
                    wait until next week?  She has an 
                    important function--

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Oh come on, it s a birthday party 
                    for a spoiled little-

                                  HARRY
                    Mr. Matthews, I got it.

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    Do you see what we re dealing with, 
                    Harry?

                                  HARRY
                    I see that she hasn t done the 
                      assignment.  What am I missing 
                    here?  Just write the paper.

                                    CHARLES BENNETT
                    So you re going to go along with 
                    this giving Naomi an incomplete?     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           14.


                                  HARRY
                    Let s be clear. Naomi already has 
                    an incomplete. This project was due 
                    a week ago and she failed to turn 
                    it in.  Mr. Matthews rightly 
                    insisted she complete it.  Aren t 
                    those the facts, Ms. Taylor?

                                  KELLY TAYLOR
                    Yes.  We agreed she could still get 
                    a grade if she turned it in by 
                    Friday. If not, then her grade goes 
                    from an  I  to an  F  and she can 
                    kiss Yale good-bye.

  Harry gives a steady look. Mr. Bennett glares back, stands.

                                    CHARLES BENNETT
                    You should have stayed in Kansas, 
                    Harry.  I m calling the 
                      superintendent and you ll be the 
                    ones kissing your tiny little jobs 
                    good-bye.

  Mr. Bennett exits.  Tracy Bennett takes her time standing. 

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    Ironic, isn t it, Harry?  If things 
                    happened differently, we could have 
                    been talking about our kid.

  Kelly and Ryan exchange an  oh shit  look.  Mrs. Bennett exits.  

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Whoa.  That sounded interesting.

                                  HARRY
                    Little advice, Mr. Matthews. I hear 
                    you re a good teacher, but you re a 
                    tad casual with your mouth.  This 
                    isn t your Facebook page so show 
                    some respect for others.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Sorry, I was just-- thanks for 
                    backing me.  See ya around.

  Ryan exits.

                                  KELLY TAYLOR
                    He is a little mouthy, but the kids 
                    love him, he grades surprisingly

  An awkward beat.

                                  HARRY
                    Mrs. Bennett and I went out for a 
                    bit back in high school.

                                  KELLY TAYLOR
                    Yeah, no shit.

  A beat, then they both laugh.


  INT. WEST BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

  Dixon heads through the halls, late. Still some straggling 
  clumps of fashionable Bev Hills kids. Dixon glances from his 
  schedule to a passing younger kid.

                                  DIXON
                    Hey. The secondary gym?

                                    YOUNGER KID
                    Uh. I m a freshman.

  Dixon shakes his head. Great. Then, a girl s voice.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    One floor up.

  Dixon turns, sees the source of the info. A DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY 
  who takes his breath away.

                                    DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY
                          (playfully smart-assed)
                    That s why it s called the 
                      secondary.  Second floor. They re 
                    clever like that.  You re cute, 
                    though. Run with that...

  Dixon gapes at Dark-Haired Beauty. The two girls she s walking 
  with titter. Dark-Haired Beauty shoots one more smouldering look 
  back over her shoulder at Dixon, and then she s gone. 


  INT. WEST BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - DRAMA CLASS - DAY

  ANNIE is on the floor painting some scenery when a hand-painted 
  Converse shoe steps on her notebook indicating a band sticker...

                                  SILVER (O.S.)
                    What s this?     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           16.


  Annie looks up. She s being addressed by SILVER. Dark hair. 
  Pretty. Aggressively  different.  Annie can t figure out why she 
  she s pissed off.

                                  ANNIE

                      Impossible. They have like eight 
                    fans in the whole world. Where d 
                    you get it, new kid?

                                  ANNIE
                    Brandon Flowers put one of their 
                    songs on his celebrity playlist, so 
                    I checked  em out.

  A very slight smile now comes over Silver s face.

                                  SILVER
                    Nice. Exactly how I found them. 

  Silver plunks down her belongings and drops down next to her.

                                  SILVER
                    I m Silver.

                                  ANNIE
                    I m Annie.

                                  SILVER
                    I know.  It s all over the news.

                                  ANNIE
                    Silver?

                                  SILVER
                    Just Silver.  Look princess, I 
                    wasn t planning on making you feel 
                    welcome here but then I saw the 
                    sticker. So where have you been all 
                    my life?

                                  ANNIE
                    Preparing for this moment..?

                                  SILVER
                    Wow.  The principal s daughter is 
                    funny too. What a shocker.

                                  ANNIE
                    Thank you and nice to meet you too.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           17.


                                  SILVER
                    Oh, you ll learn to dig me. I m 
                    totally benevolent.

  Annie and Silver crack up.

                                  ANNIE
                    Yay! A friend.

  A nice moment until a hand drops on Annie s shoulder. She looks 
  up, discovers Naomi.

                                  NAOMI
                    I need to borrow you.  Now.

                                  ANNIE
                    Yeah. Okay.

                                  SILVER
                    Hey Naomi. If you need help 
                      practicing turning Wheel of Fortune 
                    letters, I can totally carve out 
                    some time.

  Naomi waves bye-bye over her shoulder as she leads Annie away. 

                                  ANNIE
                    What are you borrowing me for?

                                  NAOMI
                    Actually, I m saving you. She s not 
                    good for the rep, she s way too 
                    weird.  And I felt bad about this 
                    morning, kind of bugging out on you 
                    and stuff, but I was all peri-oidal 
                    when I couldn t find Ethan but I m 
                    back now so, hi.  

                                  ANNIE
                    So are you and Adrianna good 
                    friends?

                                  NAOMI
                    Best. Is this because she was a 
                    bitch to you?  She just gets all 
                    psycho when she s doing a show.  A 
                    lot of pressure and has to, like, 
                    double up on the Ritalin.

  They ve arrived in the back corner. Two other hot girls slump in 
  chairs. They re supposed to be working on scenery but that s not 
  going to happen.      "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           18.

                    Anyway, if you re really into the

                    No.  I don t do little plays.

  Naomi sits, pats the next chair. Annie looks around. Sits.  

  ANGLE ON SILVER watching as Annie sits with the  it  girls. 


  EXT. LACROSSE PRACTICE FIELD

  Dixon is standing in his newly-issued WBHHS gym attire in a long 
  line of boys.  Navid is standing beside him.  Some P.E. teachers 
  are handing out crappy lacrosse equipment to the assembled 
  masses.  Across the way, the varsity lacrosse team, lead by 
  their coach, Ryan Matthews, and Ethan Ward.

                                  NAVID
                    Oh man, this sucks.  I got killed

                    Lacrosse tryouts.  Mr. Matthews 
                    uses his off period to try and find 
                    practice players AKA raw meat to be 
                    pounded by the thugs.  It s like a 
                    Nazi experiment.  And I can say 
                    that because I m a Jew.

  INT. WEST BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM

  Adrianna is at her station in chemistry lab when the Michael 
  Cera type from Quiz Bowl walks up to her.

                                    MICHAEL CERA-TYPE
                    I accidentally grabbed your book... 
                    by accident.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Yeah.  I guess I got yours too.

  They switch books and the Michael Cera kid goes back to his lab 
  station.  Adrianna puts the book beneath the desk so nobody can 
  see and opens it.  There is a cut out hole in the middle of the 
  book containing a bag of several pills. Seconal, Halcion, Xanax, 
  you name it, it s there.  There is also a note that reads  $600. 
    Tomorrow .

  She looks over at the Michael Cera kid and gives him a nod.  
  There is fear in her eyes, but after she places the book in her 
  backpack she returns to her studied indifference.


  EXT. LACROSSE PRACTICE FIELD

  Practice is underway and as promised, Ethan and the team take no 
    prisoners.  They run over the smaller opponents left and right 
  and play with speed and intimidation.  Ethan runs over Navid and 
  then scores a goal.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Good job, E.  Alright, nothing 
                    there, next ten.

  Dixon and others trot out to the field.  Ethan starts with the 
  ball and does a fancy pass to another player, GEORGE EVANS, but 
  it is intercepted by Dixon.  He takes off running towards the 
  goal.  There is a moment of stunned silence as this has NEVER 
  happened before in gym.  After a beat, the varsity team gives 
  chase but Dixon is too good and weaves in and out of the players 
  and fires a shot for a score.

                                  NAVID
                      SPARTA!!!!

  Navid leads the other hapless gym nerds in the chant  Ow eww.  
  Ow eww.  Ow eww  from the movie  300.  George is not happy.  
  Ethan is intrigued.  Ryan is impressed.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Looks like the principal s kid s 
                    got some game.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           20.


                                  DIXON
                    I started as an Attacker on my club 
                    team back in Wichita.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Well, put on a black shirt and 
                    let s see how you do in the big 
                    show.  Evans, play on the gym team 
                    and guard him tight.

  George Evans stews.

  A MONTAGE:  Dixon is playing great, in fact, he and Ethan have 
  an amazing chemistry.  Great passes, great moves, reading each 
  other s minds, trading high fives, it s like they ve played 
  together for years.  And George Evans getting frustrated because 
  he can t guard Dixon.  After another goal, Dixon reaches down to 
  tie his shoe.

                                  ETHAN
                    Dude, I think you ve made the team.

                                  DIXON
                    Man.  Nice moves.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Yo, you guys can makeout later, 
                    wind sprints at the other end.

  Ethan takes off running, but turns around to see where Dixon is, 
  and as he looks back everyone else is watching the other way. 

  George slashes Dixon HARD across the back of the legs.  Dixon 
  acting on instinct immediately slashes back.  Of course that is 
  the only thing the coaches see.  Dixon and George jump on each 
  on other and start fighting.  The coaches run in to separate 
  them.

                    I don t think I can do this.

                    you thought of when you heard he 
                    was in a fight?  Then maybe that s 
                    why he lost.

                                  DIXON
                    I didn t lose.

                                    TABITHA
                    Never worry about being fair. Just 
                    grab on to his jewels and twist 
                    them like a garbage bag.

                                  HARRY
                    Okay, Mom.  And for what it s 
                    worth, I heard he got in some good 
                    shots.

                                  CELIA
                    That s not the point.

                                  HARRY
                    No, it s not the point at all.  I m 
                    just saying--

                                    TABITHA
                    Well I think I m going to let you 
                    kids hash this out alone.  I m 
                    going to call Dan Tana s for some

                                  DIXON
                    He slashed me and I retaliated.

                                  HARRY
                    You know the retaliator always gets 
                    caught.  You have to control your 
                    temper.

                                  DIXON
                    I know, but I didn t start it.  And 
                    that Ethan dude, he was looking 
                    right at us.  He knows, but he 
                    wouldn t say anything.

                                  ANNIE
                    I m not surprised.  I don t trust 
                    Ethan Ward at all.

                                  CELIA
                    You know him?

                                  ANNIE
                    Sort of.  He s just kinda sleazy, 
                    you know?  Like everyone worships 
                    him but I don't think he s a very 
                    good person.

  Tabitha sticks her head back in.

                                    TABITHA
                    Was it racially motivated?

  INT. CLUB - NIGHT

  A driving beat in a packed club.  Ryan is having a drink at the  
  bar when Naomi bellies up next to him.

                    How did you get in here?

                                  NAOMI
                    Me?  How did you?  You re just a 
                    teacher.  Didn t the cover charge 
                    eat up like a month s salary or 
                      something?

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Maybe you should apply that caustic 
                    wit to your term paper that s due 
                    Friday.

                                  NAOMI
                    Actually, I spent all afternoon and 
                    early evening working on it.  I 
                    figured I was spending more time 
                    fighting it than it would take to 
                    actually do it.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    That and your daddy couldn t get 
                    you out of it.

                                  NAOMI
                    You know, you think you have power 
                    over me because you can make me do 
                    a stupid, little paper.  But in the 
                    end, you re just a broke, 
                      struggling teacher who spends his 
                    nights all alone in a bar full of 
                      strangers.

  The BARTENDER brings over a few beers and places them in front 
  of Ryan.  Ryan throws his cash on the bar.

                    Real friends who care about me 
                    because of what we ve been through 
                    together. Not the fake kind where 
                    it s about what you wear and how 
                    much money you have. Because when 
                    you re lying in bed at night 
                    staring at the ceiling with nobody 
                    watching, you know that you re as 
                    empty as this glass.  
                          (to Bartender)
                    She s underage.  Don t serve her.

  Naomi steams.  Ryan heads over to his table of friends and 
  kisses a hot girl who is obviously his girlfriend.  Naomi looks 
  at her reflection in the mirror.  Just for a second, we see that 
  she suspects he is right.

                    I m using my old paper on Gatsby

                                  DIXON
                    Yeah, she s not exactly a Rhodes

                    besides, it s more fear than guts 
                    because you know Naomi would ruin

                    You could ruin hers if she knew

                    Yeah, well I m only focused on my 
                    own survival right now.  I mean, 
                    Mom and Dad can talk all they want 
                    about doing the right thing and not 
                    caring what people think but I do 
                    care what people think.  To them 
                    it s just a speech, but to me, it s 
                    my life. I m the one who would be 
                      miserable.  And besides, if they 
                    hadn t made us move here I wouldn t 
                    be doing this so it s just as much

                                    TABITHA
                    Please. Annie. How many times have 
                    I said it?  We re theater people -- 
                    call me Tabitha.

                                  ANNIE
                    Dad doesn t like that.

                    He wet his bed until he was six.  I 
                    didn t like that either. Now how 
                    about these, Cinderella?

  Tabitha pulls out a few garment bags from the hallway.  Annie s 
  eyes widen.


  INT. TABITHA MILLS HOME

  Tracy Bennett is sitting on the couch and she s the only one who 
  doesn t find this scene awkward.  It s past 10:30 now.

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    And then Harry... what were we, 17?

                                  HARRY
                    Yeah, sure.

                    thinks it looks like a ladder.  And 
                    the whole thing comes crashing down 
                    and he slides down on it for like 
                    fifty feet like a sled.  Oh my god 
                    did we laugh, but he was lucky he 
                    wasn t killed.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           30.


                                  HARRY
                    Well, that was a long time ago.  
                    Can I call you a cab to get you 
                    home?

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    I have a better idea.  Why don t 
                    you drive me home?

                                  CELIA
                    Or even better, why don t I drive 
                    you home and we can share stories 
                    about Harry s penis?

                    I have enough of my own, thank you.

                    So should we turn off the lights or 
                    stay up and wait for some more ex-

                                  HARRY
                    I m sorry.  That was pretty weird.

                                  CELIA
                    Yeah.  And I m getting those jeans 
                    tomorrow.  They looked really good.


  INT. ANNIE S BEDROOM

  Annie is wearing one of Tabitha s classic dresses and she looks 
    absolutely stunning.  Harry and Celia poke their heads in.

                                  CELIA
                    Wow.  What s going on here?

  INT. HOT DANCE CLUB - NIGHT

  This looks like the coolest place in the world.  Hundreds of 
  hot, gyrating bodies pack the floor.  In the middle of the 
  action is Naomi, Ethan, Adrianna and others from their pack.  

                                  ETHAN
                    The thing is, Dixon didn t start 
                    it.  George did.  He was pissed the 
                    guy was better.  But George is all 
                    like, you have to do this man.  
                    Just say he slashed me first and 
                    jumped me and get him kicked off 
                    the team instead of me.

                                  NAOMI
                    Did you know that Dixon guy is that 
                    new girl Annie s brother?  I think 
                    he s adopted.  I haven t seen the 
                    mom, but the dad doesn t strike me 
                    as having jungle fever.

                                  ETHAN
                    Okay, back to my problem.

                                  NAOMI
                    What problem?  Just do it.

                                  ETHAN
                    Are you listening?  He didn t do 
                    anything wrong.  I would have hit 
                    George if he had done that to me.

                                  NAOMI
                    Yeah, but nobody would do that to 
                    you.  And you ve been friends with 
                    George since you were twelve.  You 
                    don t even know this other guy.  
                    You have to back George.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           32.


                                  ETHAN
                    I hate being in the middle of this 
                    crap.  I just want it to go away.

                                  NAOMI
                    So make it go away.  But do me a 
                    favor, don t say anything to the 
                    coach about the black guy until 
                      Annie-Get-Your-Gun hands over my 
                    term paper. I need it tomorrow and 
                    I don t want anything F-ing with 
                    that. 

                                  ETHAN
                    I thought your parents took care of 
                    that.

                                  NAOMI
                    The only thing my parents take care 
                    of is themselves.

  A beat.

                                  ETHAN
                    Anyway, Coach will kill me if I 
                    stay here too late so I think I m 
                    going to go.

  Naomi looks over and sees Ryan Matthews having a great time with 
  his friends.  She is not going to be alone again.  She hands her 
  purse to Adrianna.

                                  NAOMI
                    Hold my purse, A.

  Naomi then takes Ethan by the hand and exits the dance floor.

                                  NAOMI
                    You can t go yet.  I need you.  
                    Now. 

  Naomi pushes past the line of women waiting for the single 
  bathroom and cuts off the woman about to go in and locks the 
  door.

  Naomi pulls Ethan up against her body.

                    Just tell me you love me before 
                    you re in me.

                                  ETHAN
                    I love you.

  Naomi pulls up her skirt and they start to go at it.


  INT. HOT DANCE CLUB

  Adrianna has migrated to the dark corner of the club.  She looks 
  around, then takes out Naomi s wallet from the purse.  She pulls 
  out her ATM card, places it in her own purse, then puts Naomi s 
  wallet back.

  She returns to the crowd on the dance floor seemingly without a 
  care in the world.

  EXT. WEST BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - STUDENT PARKING LOT - DAY

  Dixon and Annie shoulder their bags, head toward the school. As 
  they pass by a CLASSIC OPEN-AIR BRONCO, one of the skaters 
  hanging out in the back shouts out to them.

                                  SKATER
                    Jethro! Ellie Mae! Mind if we come 
                    over later and skate in your ce-
                    ment pond?

  The assembled skaters -- Silver s fan base -- all get a laugh 
  out of that. Dixon pauses like he may have something to say 
  about this, but Annie pulls him along and away from trouble.

                                  DIXON
                    What was that about?

                                  ANNIE
                    I have no idea.  I just know that a 
                    second fight would probably not be 
                    the smartest thing to do.

  As they walk, people are pointing and laughing at them.  They 
  are met by Navid.

                                  NAVID
                    Morning Leonidis.  It s all over

                    Way to cockblock, dude.  Thank you.

  Dixon and Annie exchange a worried look.


  INT. WEST BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM

  Annie and Dixon watch a YouTube clip loading on Navid s 
    Powerbook.  Off the still photo, they see Silver.

  ON SCREEN - Bossa Nova music scores a slow pan up the length of 
  Silver s body. As the shot lands, we re left with a framing not 
  unlike BUNNY LEBOWSKI by the pool. Silver looks up from her 
  laptop as though she s surprised.

                    One of you must have done something

  Silver blows a  Dating Game  kiss goodbye.  Then the next one 
  comes up...

  ON SCREEN - We see the  Beverly Hillbillies  theme song being 
  acted out by collage stick puppets. Clearly the photos Silver 
  took of Annie, Dixon, and, apparently, Harry. It s cutting and 
  mean. And very public.  Finally, Dixon hits  stop. 


  INT. WEST BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY

  Annie spots Silver at her locker. Silver notices Annie coming. 
  Looks away. But Annie walks straight for her. Silver glances up. 
    Self-conscious and awkward, preparing for some kind of face-off. 
  Instead, Annie is very genuine, in other words, herself.

                                  ANNIE
                    Hey. Saw the Beverly Hillbillies 
                    video. Funny stuff.

                                  SILVER
                    Thanks.

                    I m just not sure what I did to 
                    make you so angry that you had to 
                    do that.

                                  SILVER
                    Gee I don t know, maybe dissing me 
                    like I was a piece of garbage to go 
                    sit with the Bratz dolls.

                    Okay, first of all. I didn t diss 
                    you.  Naomi pulled me away.  I had 
                    already met her before you, in fact 
                    Mr. Matthews asked her to help me.  
                    Second of all, it was my first day 
                    and I don t know who to trust, who 
                    to be friends with or what the

  As he heads to class, Dixon catches sight of the DARK-HAIRED 
  BEAUTY heading the other direction. Dixon breaks into a near-
  run, cuts through classrooms, around lockers, gets to the spot 
  that allowed him to  cut her off at the pass. 

  Dixon pulls a copy of his schedule out of his bag, adopts a 
   lost  posture. A beat later, DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY lands in the 
  spot. She eyes Dixon looking confused, she approaches.

                    This rotating schedule takes 
                    getting used to.

  Dixon hands over the schedule. Dark-Haired Beauty smirks.

                                    DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY
                    I see your trouble.

  And with that, she s off.  Dixon is reduced to putty.  The

  No one on the quiz bowl team seems to know the answer. The Quiz 
  Bowl Coach looks up, frustrated.

  All eyes turn to Dixon who doesn t look up from his notebook.

    literature query.

  More uncomfortable silence from the team. The coach turns back 
  toward Dixon.

                    like that and not have any 
                      punishment?

                                  CELIA
                    No, but it could have started 
                    tomorrow.

                                  HARRY
                    Yeah, it could have.  But I guess I 
                    feel like we have to be a little 
                    tougher out here.

                                  CELIA
                    I guess I feel that you were easier 
                    on Naomi than your own daughter.


  INT. ANNIE S BEDROOM

  Harry and Celia knock on the door, then enter.

                                  HARRY
                    Sweetie.  It s not even eight yet.  
                    You can still go to the party.

  They find Tabitha pacing around the room and an open window.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Where is Annie?

                                    TABITHA
                    Exactly where she s supposed to be.

  INT. HONDA CIVIC - MOVING - NIGHT

  Silver is driving, dressed in something that might make Gwen 
  Stefani blush.  Annie rides shotgun.

                                  SILVER
                    Okay, one of those small world 
                    stories. The printer Naomi used to 
                    make her party invites? Same 
                    printer the theater department uses 
                    for programs and whatnot. Voila.

  She whips out a stack of party invites.

                                  SILVER (CONT D)
                    I gave about fifty to these skaters 
                    from Fairfax High.  This is all I 
                    have left.

  She rolls down the window and screams at some pedestrians.

                                  SILVER (CONT D)
                    Party tonight! Free booze!

  She flings them out into the street.


  INT. NAVID S CAR - NIGHT

  Dixon and Navid cruise down Sunset Boulevard in all its glory.

                                  DIXON
                    Thanks for letting me be your 
                    wingman tonight. I had to get into 
                    this party.

                                  NAVID
                    You re not my wingman, you re my 
                    bitch.  We re working.  Of course 
                    once we get enough footage...

                                  DIXON
                    Oh yeah.  I need to hang with some 
                    of these hot babes, get my mind off 
                    the lacrosse fiasco.

                                  NAVID
                    Why doesn t your dad just make them 
                    put you back on the team?     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           53.


                                  DIXON
                    He can t.  He tried.  District 
                    wouldn t let him so he s filing an 
                    appeal.  But like I said, Ethan 
                    will get his.

                                  NAVID
                    What did you do?

                                  DIXON
                    We ll see.

                                  NAVID
                    Okay so then answer me this, 
                    because I gotta ask:  What s the 
                    deal with you being in a white 
                    family?

                                  DIXON
                    They were my foster family from 
                    when I was like eight and then they 
                    adopted me when I was ten.  

                                  NAVID
                    So what about your real parents?

                                  DIXON
                    They are my real parents.

  And they drive up to...


  EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - ESTABLISHING

  The hotel looking, gorgeous at night.


  EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - LAWN - NIGHT

  MUSIC - Hip modern remix of Nino Rota 60 s pop.

  Dixon and Navid are shooting video.  There s a damn HELICOPTER 
  suspended from unseen wires, and hanging from the helicopter is 
  a giant  La Dolce Vita  movie poster.  But this one has Naomi 
  assuming the pose of Anita Ekberg.

  We HEAR A ROAR OF ENGINES and kids squealing.

  We find hundreds of well-dressed, excited kids gathered for the 
  grand entrance. Five classic Vespas motor up the sidewalk in 
  front of the cheering guests. Naomi arrives last wearing the 
  ANITA EKBERG dress.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           54.


  FAKE PAPARAZZI in classic Italian suits begin snapping photos of 
  the girls as they climb off the Vespas and stroll up the red 
  carpet to the Crystal Ballroom waving to the guests.

  Reveal that Dixon, Annie, Silver and Navid are all standing 
  together.  Dixon and Annie s jaws are on the floor.

                                  NAVID
                    Just like back home?

                                  DIXON
                    Back home we cruise from the Dairy 
                    Queen to the Wal-Mart parking lot. 
                    So, yeah, pretty much the same.

  Annie gets a text message from Harry.

                                  ANNIE
                    Uh oh.  Dad knows.

  Dixon s cell vibrates too.

                                  DIXON
                    I just got one too.  It says  Come 
                    home now.   But at this point, how 
                    much more trouble can you get into?

                                  ANNIE
                    You know what?  I ve been the good 
                    girl my entire life and I still got 
                    grounded.  And I may never get out 
                    again, so the hell with it.  I m 
                    staying.

  The foursome all holler their approval.

                                  ANNIE (CONT D)
                    But I ll text Mom I m okay and that 
                    I ll be home around midnight.

                                  DIXON
                    And I ll text her that you re with 
                    me the whole time so you re safe.  
                    Meet me back here at 11:30.

  The girls head off.  Dixon spots his girl, the Dark-Haired 
  Beauty. He grabs Navid s shoulder, excitedly.

                                  DIXON (CONT D)
                    Who s that girl?

                                  NAVID
                    Lauren Strange.

                    I swear that s her name. Rumor is 
                    she once...  talked  her way onto 
                    the Buckcherry tour bus--

                                  DIXON
                    This place.  There s like maybe 
                    four chicks like that in the entire 
                    midwest.  Maybe.


  INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

  Annie and Silver approach the two girls working the door. 
  There s a red velvet rope and a couple muscle-bound bouncers in 
    sunglasses and suits keeping out the undesirables. 

                                  SILVER
                    So are we going to the ballroom at 
                    all or just hitting the room 
                    parties?

                                  ANNIE
                    What s the difference?

                                  SILVER
                    Room parties are where all the 
                    action is -- the sex, drugs, and 
                    mini-bar banditry.

                                  ANNIE
                    Let s stick to the ballroom.

                                  SILVER
                    I m with ya. All the quality guy 
                    browsing happens in the ballroom.

                                  ANNIE
                    Actually, I have a boyfriend.  He s 
                    back in Wichita.

                                  SILVER
                    Trust me, that ain t gonna last.

  Silver hands over the invitations. The girl regards her 
    suspiciously.

                                  SILVER (CONT D)
                    Move the rope, honey.


  INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - CRYSTAL BALLROOM - NIGHT

  TWO SHOT of Silver and Annie as they enter. What she sees takes 
  Annie s breath away. Silver is unfazed.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           56.


  REVEAL ANNIE S POV - it s decadence everywhere she looks. Hyper-
    sexualized dancing. A recreation of the Trevi fountain in the 
  center of the room. Hard-bodied bartenders in tight 1960s-style 
  bathing trunks and bikini-clad bartendresses stand on tables and 
  pour shot bottles straight into the open mouths of the party-
  goers.

                                  SILVER
                    What did I tell you -- lame.


  INT. TABITHA MILLS HOME

  Harry is putting on his jacket to go out.  Annie and Tabitha 
  watch.

                                  ANNIE
                    Okay, I get that you are angry, but 
                    don t make a scene.  She has to go 
                    to school with these kids for the 
                    next two years.

                                  HARRY
                    I won t.  But she just can t sneak 
                    out when she s grounded, then 
                    totally disregard us ordering her 
                    home.  I mean, I know I was maybe 
                    too tough before, but now?  I m 
                    right and you know it.

                                    TABITHA
                    Woo hoo.  Maybe they should throw 
                    you a parade.

  Harry exits.

                                  ANNIE
                    You really shouldn t interfere with 
                    the kids, Tabitha.

                                    TABITHA
                    Get used to it.


  INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - CRYSTAL BALLROOM - NIGHT

  Dixon and Navid stand by the bar.

                                  NAVID
                    I m gonna go pick up some B-roll.

                                  DIXON
                    You do that.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           57.


  Navid departs. Dixon scans the room with his eyes until he finds 
  her -- Lauren Strange on the dance floor. She s dancing with 
  another girl. If Dixon had been in Beverly Hills longer, he d 
  probably realize quickly that she s rolling hard on E.

  Dixon isn t shy. He makes his way out to her.

                                  DIXON
                    I made it.

                                  LAUREN
                    It s you. It s really you.

  Lauren surprises Dixon by throwing her arms around him and 
  putting her tongue in his mouth. The kiss lasts seconds.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Let s go upstairs.

                                  DIXON
                          (what planet am I on?)
                    Cool.

  ANOTHER PART OF THE BALLROOM

  Annie and Silver are crossing, but they get separated.  They are 
  several feet away from each other when Silver runs into Adrianna 
  and Annie into Naomi. 

                                  SILVER
                    Too bad about the play.  But I 
                    figured if I poured a half bottle 
                    of Nyquil into your Coke, Annie 
                    would get her chance.  Just 
                    kidding.  Maybe.

  Adrianna can t believe what she just heard as Silver walks away.

  ANGLE on Annie and Naomi.

                                  ANNIE
                    If you want us to leave--

                                  NAOMI
                    That s a beautiful dress, Annie.  
                    You look great.

                                  ANNIE
                    Thanks.  So what did Mr. Matthews 
                    give you on your paper?

                                  NAOMI
                    I don t know.  He s grading it 
                    tonight.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           58.


  Naomi walks away.  She doesn t seem her normal snotty self.


  INT. RYAN MATTHEWS APARTMENT

  Ryan is reading Naomi s paper.  He s marking it up when there is 
  a knock at the door.  He gets up and opens it.  It s the The 
  Michael Cera-Type kid.  They are both surprised.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Where s Tim?

                                    MICHAEL CERA-TYPE
                    I don t know Tim.  They just sent 
                    me.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Yeah, uh, look, you re not--

                                    MICHAEL CERA-TYPE
                    I m not going to say anything, Mr. 
                    Matthews.  Bad for business.

  He hands him a baggie of pills, Ryan hands him some money and 
  shuts the door.  His expression says  oh fuck. 


  INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

  Harry enters the hotel lobby looking for Annie. He spies her as 
  she comes out of the ballroom with Silver.  They are laughing 
  and having a great time in that silly way that only the young 
  can.  Harry smiles at seeing her so happy. And looking so 
    beautiful.


  EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

  Harry is on his cell to Celia as he exits.

                                  HARRY
                    She doesn t have me tied around her 
                    finger.  I just figured it s been a 
                    tough week, I forced the move on 
                    her, maybe I should cut her some 
                    slack.

  He looks up and sees Tracy Bennett smoking on the steps and 
  heading towards him.

                                  HARRY
                    I ll be home soon.  Love ya.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           59.

                    We need to talk.


  INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

  A notorious room party. The smoky room is jammed with kids. 
    Heavy-duty drinking going on everywhere the camera points. 
  CAMERA EVENTUALLY FINDS DIXON. He s pressed up against a wall. 
  Lauren is making out with him. She pulls away.

                                  LAUREN
                    What s your name, again?

                                  DIXON
                    Dixon.

                                  LAUREN
                    How about we--

  Lauren s phone vibrates.  She reads the text message.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    I gotta go.  My boyfriend finally 
                    got here.  You want to meet him?

                                  DIXON
                    No.

  And with that, she is gone.  Leaving Dixon confused but still 
  happy.


  EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

  Harry and Tracy are having it out in the parking lot.

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    Yes, I am still angry.  And maybe 
                    if you had at least talked to me 
                    back then, taken more 
                      responsibility than just giving me 
                    200 dollars and running back to 
                    college it wouldn t bother me so 
                    much.  Would it have killed you to 
                    call me?  Write a letter?

                                  HARRY
                    I didn t know how to handle it, 
                    okay?  We were broken up.  I m 
                    sorry, I freaked, but it was more 
                    than twenty years ago. And besides, 
                    I did ask about you afterwards.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    You went off to Europe for the 
                    year.

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    I didn t go to Europe, Harry.  And 
                    I didn t go to the clinic.  I went 
                    away to have the baby.  So he could 
                    be adopted.  We have a son 
                    together.

  Harry is in shock...


  INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - CRYSTAL BALLROOM - NIGHT

  Naomi is holding the microphone and addressing her guests in the 
    background as Dixon strolls into the room looking for Navid. 
  However, he is stopped by Ethan sitting on one of the chairs. 
  Ethan is sporting a pretty good-sized black eye.

                                  ETHAN
                    You re back on the team, Millsy.

                                  DIXON
                    What?  How?

                                  ETHAN
                    How do you think?  I told coach the 
                    truth.

                                  DIXON
                    Really?

                                  ETHAN
                    Of course some of the guys weren t 
                    too happy about it so we may be the 
                    only players on the team now.

                                  DIXON
                    That s okay, man.  That s all we 
                    need. 
                          (beat)
                    Hey.  Thanks for doing that.

                                  ETHAN
                    Just pass me the ball, Dude.

  They turn their attention to Naomi as she turns her attention to 
  Ethan.

                                  NAOMI
                    Lastly, I want to thank my 
                      boyfriend, Ethan. You have taught 
                    me so much, baby.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           61.


  Random cheers. Ethan beams in his seat. Mouths  I love you. 

                                  NAOMI (CONT D)
                    I guess the biggest lesson you 
                    taught me is never trust a man with 
                    your heart.  Ever.

  Ethan s eyes go wide. Suddenly you could hear a pin drop.

                                  NAOMI (CONT D)
                    Because recently I found out that 
                    my boyfriend Ethan was getting BJ s 
                    from my best friend, Adrianna.

  Ethan looks suddenly helpless in his seat.  Adrianna turns 
  white.  Navid is videotaping all of this.  Ethan glares over at 
  Annie, who looks back and shakes her head  No  violently and 
  mouths  It wasn t me.   He believes her, you just know she 
  wouldn t.

                                  ETHAN
                    Mills, when I find out who did this 
                    I am going to mess them up bad.

                                  DIXON
                    I don t blame you.

  The crowd starts booing Ethan.

                                  ETHAN
                    Let s get out of here.

  Ethan exits, and pulled by force of personality, Dixon and Navid 
  follow him.  Navid whispers.

                                  NAVID
                    You told her, didn t you?

                                  DIXON
                    I don t know nothing.


  EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL PARKING LOT

  Annie and Silver are walking to the car.

                                  ANNIE
                    Every time I think I have seen or 
                    heard it all out here, something

                                  ANNIE
                    Do you want to come over to my 
                    house or go to yours?

                                  SILVER
                    Yours.  We got company, it s too 
                    crowded.

                                  ANNIE
                    Okay, let s-- is that Naomi?

  Annie stops when she notices Naomi sitting by a palm tree crying 
  her eyes out.

                                  SILVER
                    Oh god I hope so.  I love seeing 
                    her miserable.

                                  ANNIE
                    It s her birthday, Silver.

  Annie heads over.

                                  SILVER
                    I know.  That s what makes it fun 
                    for me.

  Annie stands next to Naomi.

                                  ANNIE
                    Can we give you a ride somewhere?


  INT. TABITHA MILLS HOME

  Harry enters and finds Celia channel surfing on the couch.  
  Tabitha is sound asleep and snoring like a lumberjack.

                                  CELIA
                    She might have had a drop of Cutty 
                    Sark.

  Harry hesitates for a beat, then...

  EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH

    Underneath the Santa Monica pier. There are bonfires, surfboards 
  standing in the sand, a full moon illuminating the water, scores 
  of young people drinking and laughing, the coolest beach party 
  ever... And Ethan is teaching Dixon how to surf. They are 
  stripped down to their underwear and having a blast.

                                  DIXON
                    I m standing up.  I m standing. 
                    Whoa.

  He s knocked over by a wave.  They drag their tired bodies onto 
  the beach where Navid hands them Styrofoam containers.

                                  ETHAN
                    You got pummeled, dude.  Is that 
                    beer?

                                  NAVID
                    7up.  I m president of Students 
                    Against Drunk Driving.

                                  ETHAN
                    Who are you?

  As the guys chug their drinks, off in the near distance we see 
  three women holding their shoes and walking in formal dresses to 
  the beach party.  It s Annie, Silver and Naomi.

                                  ANNIE
                    Uh oh.  Don t look, but Ethan is 
                    here.

                                  NAOMI
                    I figured.  That s why I told you 
                    to come here.  Thanks for the ride, 
                    Annie.  Thanks for being so nice.

  Naomi jogs up ahead to Ethan who looks at her for a beat, holds 
  out his hand and they go walking silently towards the pier until 
  they disappear in the shadows.

                                  SILVER
                    That is one messed up relationship.

                                  ANNIE
                    Once again, you think you ve seen 
                    it all...     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           64.


                                  SILVER
                    Speaking of potential 
                      relationships, what s the story on 
                    your brother there?  Because he is 
                    looking good to me.

                                  ANNIE
                    I think he ll do anything with a 
                    pulse.

                                  SILVER
                    That s one thing I do have.

  Dixon and Navid approach.

                                  DIXON
                    It s 11:15.  Think we should be 
                    heading home.

                                  ANNIE
                    Yeah, I just wish I brought my 
                    bathing suit for a dip.  I ve still 
                    never been in the ocean.

                                  SILVER
                    Honey, this ain t Podunk, Kansas.  
                    Take off the dress and swim in your 
                      underwear.

  Silver takes off her dress and heads for the water.

                                  ANNIE
                    Is this insane?

                                  DIXON
                    This whole week s been insane,  but 
                    when have we ever had this much 
                    fun?

  Annie smiles and then pulls off her dress.

                                  ANNIE
                    Alright.  Welcome to California.

  They run to the water and dive in the ocean as we crane out...
