  CLIFF Addisson, handsome and still boyish in his 30 s, is 
  behind the wheel. He s a successful dentist, affable and 
  eager to please, his  nice guy  personae covering over a deep 
  well of insecurity and weakness. Short on will power, he s a 
  slave to his impulses and selfish needs, not the least of 
  which is to be loved by everyone. He turns to his wife...

  ABBEY, a raven haired stunner in the passenger seat. What he 
  lacks in will-power she makes up for in spades. She s kind, 
  level headed, but ruthlessly stubborn when she makes up her 
  mind. She s a natural beauty; perfect nose, lips, luminous 
  skin. But right now her eyes are red and tired. 

  There is a strain between them. Cliff is trying hard to make 
  up. (NOTE: The  cut-aways  in this scene serve as a temporal 
  ellipse, giving the impression of an argument taking place 
  over time.)

  Abbey turns her attention to a pack of cigarettes, LIGHTS ONE 
  UP with an ornate lighter, then crumples the pack. 

                              CLIFF 
                Look, honey, I just...

                              ABBEY
                      (cutting him off)
                I don t want to talk about it 
                anymore. 
                      (quietly)
                This is going to be my last 
                  cigarette. I want to enjoy it. 

                              CLIFF
                You re quitting? 

  She nods. Cliff digests this surprising news. 

  ANGLE ON: the car sweeps past camera. 

  BACK TO SCENE. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  2.

                That s good. 
                      (beat)
                Because I want you to be around for 
                a long time. 

  Abbey rolls her eyes. 

  ANGLE ON: The tires, spinning on the blacktop. 

  WIDE ON: the road, the car s headlights moving horizontally 
  across the darkened landscape. 

  BACK TO CLIFF AND ABBEY. He s beginning to choke up. 

                              CLIFF (cont'd)
                I love you so Goddamned much, Abby. 
                I m sorry for everything. But you 
                are my wife. We are going to grow 
                old together and I m never going to 
                let you go. 

  P.O.V. - THE ONCOMING ROAD - it s empty and quiet. 

  BACK TO CLIFF AND ABBEY-- she appears to have softened. Maybe 
  Cliff is wearing her down? 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                      (quieter)
                I m never going to let you go. 

                              ABBEY
                Really? 

                              CLIFF
                Yes. 

                              ABBEY
                      (gently)
                I want to show you something. 

  Abbey unfastens her seat belt, reaching into the back seat.

  The car sweeps by dark woods then-

  P.O.V - THE ONCOMING ROAD - A FALLEN TREE blocking the road. 


  INSIDE CAR

                              ABBEY (cont'd)

  Cliff turns, seeing it at the last moment. He JERKS the 
  wheel, simultaneously hitting the brakes. A forest of fallen 
  branches SLAP the windshield. Cliff loses control. 

  ON CLIFF, AS HE SCREAMS HIS AIR BAG EXPLODES--

  ON WHITE. THERE IS A SONIC BOOM! Gnashing metal. Then 
  silence. 

  DISSOLVE onto STEAM. Through the fog, the CAMERA finds Cliff. 
  There is a gash on his head, a lot of blood and blood on the 
  airbag in front of him. He turns to the passenger seat, but 
  it s empty. There s a large hole in the windshield.  Cliff 
  begins to fumble for his seatbelt as...

  CAMERA ROTATES 180 degrees to reveal that Cliff is UPSIDE 
  DOWN, the car having flipped into a gully.



  Cliff wakes in a hospital bed. The gash in his forehead has 
  been stitched. He focuses on--

  DR. LORING, a slender young woman, leaning over him. 

                              CLIFF
                Where am I?

                              DR. LORING
                  Westchester General Hospital. You 
                were involved in a car crash, Dr. 
                  Addisson. Do you have any idea what 
                  happened?

  Cliff shakes off his initial confusion. 

                              CLIFF
                Where s Abbey?

  She takes a breath, gearing up for the hard part. 

                              DR. LORING
                I d like you to prepare yourself. 



  A pair of PATIENTS shuffle by, both badly burned. 

  Dr. Loring pushes Cliff in a wheelchair. They arrive at a set 
  of double doors, leading to a highly restricted area... THE 
  BURN UNIT. 

  Dr. Loring punches a button and the double doors SWISH open. 



  An immaculate LABORATORY, white suited TECHNICIANS monitoring 
  patients from behind glass. 

  Cliff hears a wheezing sound... artificially induced 
  respiration amplified like the breath of God. It s coming 
  from a respirator...                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  5.





  Dr. Loring opens the door. Cliff rises from the chair, 
  stepping in. On the bed before him...

  Abbey is connected to a bank of high tech MONITORS. She is 
  bandaged from head to toe, wires and tubes coiling out of 
  every orifice.

  Cliff moves to her.

                              CLIFF
                        (whispering)
                Abbey, my angel...

  Cliff leans down close and JUMPS as ABBEY JERKS in a short 
  spasm and her LEFT EYE bolts opens, the pupil wandering 
  without purpose. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                Abbey? 
                      (no answer)
                Can she hear me? 

                              DR. LORING
                No. She may seem responsive, but 
                it s just a reflex. She s not 
                  conscious. 

  Abbey fixes her good eye on Cliff and her PULSE RATE 
    increases.

                              CLIFF
                What s happening? Is she in pain?

                              DR. LORING
                With the damage to her nerves... 
                your wife doesn t see or feel 
                  anything. 

  Cliff, filled with sorrow, turns back Abbey. 

  We MOVE DIRECTLY INTO ABBEY S EYE. THE SCREEN FILLS WITH THE 
  BLACK OF HER PUPIL AND WE HEAR ABBEY CRYING OUT IN TORMENT. 



  Dr. Loring gives Cliff the rest of the bad news. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  6.

                              CLIFF
                Will she ever regain consciousness? 

                              DR. LORING
                As far as we know there s no brain 
                damage, so yes, I would say that s 
                very likely. But Abbey s rejected 
                the first round of synthetics. 

                              CLIFF
                What does that mean? 

                              DR. LORING
                We can keep her alive for a few 
                days with a temporary allograft, 
                but she s going to need a full body 
                skin graft from a matching donor. 
                      (then)
                If a donor can be found, and the 
                  operation is successful... she ll 
                have a good chance at survival.  

                              CLIFF
                But not recovery. 

  She chooses her words carefully. 

                              DR. LORING
                Your wife is never going to be the 
                way she was before the accident. 

                              CLIFF
                Will she ever be able to speak? 

                              DR. LORING
                It s hard to say. Your wife may be 
                able to communicate, in one way or 
                another. There have been huge 
                advances in Brain-Computer 
                  Interfaces, she might be able to 
                type, or there are devices that 
                allow people to communicate through 
                eye movements... 

  It s all too horrible for Cliff to bear. 

                              CLIFF
                Abby loved life. That s not living. 
                She wouldn t want that. 





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  7.

                If you choose to discontinue life 
                  sustaining procedures, you will

                  Obtaining a Do Not Resuscitate 
                order usually takes some time. 
                Until then, we have to do 
                  everything we can to keep her 
                alive. 

  Cliff nods, sadly. 

                              CLIFF
                I ll call my lawyer.

  Cliff sits on a bench with a IRA MILSAP, Cliff s attorney, a 
    diminutive man in a power suit. 

                              IRA
                Did Abbey have a living will? 

  Cliff shakes his head  no.  

                              CLIFF
                After her father died, we had a 
                talk. She told me she wouldn t want 
                to go on. Not if she would be an 
                invalid. 

  That s what Ira was looking for. 

                              IRA
                Good enough. Sounds like her wishes 
                were clear. 

  Cliff fixes Ira with a direct, vulnerable look.

                Ira, I want you to answer not as a 
                lawyer, but as a friend: is this 
                the right thing to do? 

                              IRA
                Yes. Absolutely. 

                              CLIFF
                How can you be sure? 

                              IRA
                Abbey bought your house because she 
                looked good in it.  She liked 
                things to be beautiful.  She 
                wouldn t want to live looking like 
                a... 
                      (Cliff looks horrified)
                Not to be insensitive. The 
                  important thing is for you not to 
                feel guilty. It was an accident. 

  Cliff does not look consoled. He begins a confession. 

                              CLIFF
                You know the worst part? Our last 
                days together weren t happy. 
                      (then)
                  I cheated on her. And then I 
                crashed her into a tree. Those are 
                the last things I ll ever do for my 
                wife. 

                              IRA
                The last thing you can do for her 
                is to be strong. That s the last 
                gift you can give her. 
                      (then)
                Cliff, everyone makes mistakes. She 
                would have forgiven you. 

                              CLIFF
                        (doubtfully)
                You didn t really know her.

                Abbey could be... unbelievably 
                  stubborn. 

  Cliff drifts off into a tortured reminiscence.

                We used to make love... in the

  We pan from across the great room, a bank of windows display 
  an in-ground pool, on the interior, feminine decoration, a 
  woman s touch. Cliff enters. 

  The house surrounds Cliff, huge and empty. Cliff drops his 
  luggage and moves inside. 



  Curtains sway in the breeze, casting shadows across the room. 

  On a shelf sits a JEWELRY BOX. Cliff opens it and a miniature 
  couple dances to the melody of Cliff and Abbey s WEDDING 
  SONG. Cliff stands, listening.  A WINE GLASS, which had been 
  sitting on the shelf, falls to the floor, as if by its own 
  volition.  Cliff closes the box.  He hears SPLASH.

  Cliff moves to the window and looks sadly out to the pool.   
  He JUMPS as--BAM! A bird hits the window. Cliff looks down at 
  the bird, laying dead on the steps outside.

  The light comes on. Cliff shuffles in, wearing sweats. A 
  handwritten note on an erasable message board reads:

  Cliff opens a cabinet filled with canned goods. He removes a 
  Dinty More-style stew, empties it into a pot, and places it 
  on to a gas stove, igniting the pilot. He moves off. SHOT 
  HOLDS ON THE STEW... bubbling to a boil.



  A lonesome, modern space. 

  Cliff sits, forlorn, his mind drifting... 



  Cliff is searching behind the sofa cushions. Abbey steps in 
  from behind, something in her hand. 

                              CLIFF

  He turns to see that she s holding it in her hand. From the 
  phone s tinny speakers comes a sexy LAUGH. Cliff s face FALLS

                That just came over the internet. 
                Video spam... what will they think 
                of next?

  Abbey, not listening, eyes fixed on--

  THE CELL PHONE - VIDEO

  An unseen man s arm fondles her while she laughs. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                I think it s an ad for a sex pill. 

  CELL PHONE SCREEN - VIDEO

  Cliff moves into the shot and suckles the woman s breast. 

  BACK TO SCENE

  Cliff advances towards Abbey, still trying to be  casual.   
  From the tinny speakers come moans of ecstacy.

                It kinda looks like Trish, huh?  
                Maybe she s moonlighting as a 
                model... maybe she s got a 
                  sister...

  Cliff, behind the woman, making an impassioned  O  face as he 
  and the redhead have sex. 

  BACK TO SCENE

  Cliff reaches Abbey and holds out his hand.  She ignores him, 
  staring at the screen with disappointed, simmering rage.

                hire that slut. 

  Cliff looks into Abbey s eyes and knows that lying is 
  pointless -- he s busted.

                It s over, Abbey. I swear.

                              ABBEY
                I hope she was worth it. 

  Abbey, disgusted, drops the phone to the floor. 



  Cliff returns, looks around. The stew-- what s left of it-- 
  sizzles from the stove. He grabs the SMOKING pot, burning his 
  hand on the handle. He pivots, dropping it onto a cutting 
  board. 

  His attention is drawn to the message board where only two 
  words remain in dripping black ink:

                        Wake me 


  AT THE SINK

  Cliff scrapes the stew from the bottom of the pot. The 
  gristled meat and burnt gravy spiral into the strainer. 



  Abbey s room is silent except for her labored breathing and 
  the BLIPS and HUM of the machines. 

  The BLIPS slow as her pulse begins to fall and--

  STOPS. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  13.

  An ALARM goes off. After a moment a NURSE RUNS inside.

                      (yelling)
                DOCTOR! 



  The bath is running.

  Cliff removes his watch, placing it on the ledge, the time 
  exactly 11:02 PM. He lowers himself into the water. A pang of 
  discomfort. Cliff adjusts. Sighs. That s better. He closes 
  his eyes. 



  (SOMEONE S) POINT OF VIEW drifts through the darkness. (It) 
  pauses momentarily to admire a collection of FAMILY PHOTOS... 
  before MOVING on. 

  P.O.V approaches the STEREO CABINET. A CD Player lights up. 
  The track skips ahead to  4 . Abbey and Cliff s WEDDING SONG, 
  the same one we heard from the jewelry box.



  Cliff hums along from his semi-conscious state. 

  ANGLE ON: A small pool of water on the tile floor BOILS into 
  steam and disappears. 



  The doctor injects a syringe into Abbey, trying to revive 
  her. He waits for a response then- 

                                DOCTOR
                No good. Defibrillator!

  ON CLIFF

  Laying in the tub. Abruptly, the water level RISES to his 
  chin. Someone-- or thing-- has entered the bath. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  14.

  Cliff opens his eyes.



  ABBEY is in the tub across from him, young and perfect, her 
  bare breasts glistening above the water line.


  SUNKEN TUB - FAVORED ANGLES

  Cliff sits up, entranced.

                              CLIFF
                Abbey? 
                      (then)

                      (with longing relief)
                Abbey. 

  She rises to reveal herself, achingly beautiful, the 
  Honeymoon spoils. She moves towards Cliff and

  Straddles him. 

  Cliff GASPS as-- 

  She reaches between his legs and begins pumping. 

  He tilts his head back, eyes closed. Enraptured.

  Then a CHANGE takes place. Her once flawless skin boils with 
  BLISTERS, turning a crisp umber. 


  ON CLIFF 

  panting, his eyes in slits, remains unaware. 


  ABBEY S FACE

  turns charcoal black. 


  SUNKEN TUB - FAVORED ANGLES

  Cliff is SWEPT AWAY in the moment, when a BOILED BLOB OF 
  MELTED FLESH lands in his mouth. 

  Cliff gags, opening his eyes to find... the monstrous 
  facsimile of his wife, the ABBEY-THING.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  15.

  Cliff fights to remove her, his arms JERKING.  He grabs at 
  her arm.  Her skin sloughs off under his fingers.

  The Abbey-thing overpowers him, a voracious sexual assault.

  Cliff SCREAMS. 




  NEW ANGLE

  From one instant to the next... Cliff finds himself alone, 
  the water gone. And Abbey with it. Did it actually happen? 
  Cliff sits, gasping, spent and frightened like a baby. 



  Abbey s heart is beating again. The Doctor takes the 
    defibrillator pads from her body as the STAFF celebrate their 
    success--cheers, high fives all around.



  Cliff, in the tub, hears a sound, a MELODY, coming from the 
  bedroom. He pulls himself from the tub, grabs a towel, and 
  steps out into--



  Cliff looks to a small shelf outside the bathroom where THE 
  JEWELRY BOX IS OPEN, the tiny couple spinning, playing their 
  song. There s a framed photo next to the jewelry box: CLIFF 
  AND ABBEY S WEDDING PICTURE. SHOT PUSHES IN ON ABBEY S FACE, 
    a pleasant smile, innocent at the time. Tonight... it s taken 
  on a whole new meaning.

  Cliff closes the music box then moves back to...



  Stepping back inside, Cliff catches his reflection in a LARGE 
  MIRROR. He stops and stares because--






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  16.

  CLIFF S P.O.V. - MIRROR

  There are RED MARKS on his back, like handprints, where 
   Abbey s ghost  touched him. 

  Cliff TURNS. In the mirror TWO RED CIRCLES are revealed on 
  his chest, right about where her breasts would have touched 
  him.  

  PUSH INTO CLIFF as, with rising dread, he drops the towel 
  from his waist, staring with horror at his lower regions... 



  Cliff holds the phone to his ear. He s in a nervous panic, 
    periodically examining the red marks in a mirror. 

                                                                INTERCUT WITH:


  IRA S PILLOW & HEADBOARD3131

  A very sleepy IRA lays in bed, trying to talk some sense into 
  Cliff. 

                              IRA
                You fell asleep in the bathtub. You 
                got a boner. You had a sex dream 
                that went bad. 

                              CLIFF
                It wasn t a sex dream. It was

                she turned into a huge rottweiler

  Ira hangs up. 

  The doorbell RINGS. Then again. At this hour? Cliff heads 
  downstairs. 

  Cliff opens the door to reveal: 



  Cliff shuffles towards the whistling kettle and makes himself 
  a cup of tea. A news channel plays its morning show in the 
  living room. A FAMILIAR VOICE cuts through the din of the 
  news. With trepidation, Cliff moves to the--



  On the television, Abbey s mother, Pam, is giving a teary-

                      (on the television)

                crashed that car. He always hated 
                her. He was abusive. At family

  Clifford stands, stunned. Pam does a fantastic job of playing

  AT THE FRONT DOOR-

  Cliff heads out, looking behind him at the empty interior.




  ABBEY, ON A TILT TABLE

  suspended upright, her grisly visage fully unwrapped, 
  matching the thing that visited Cliff last night. 

  A pair of TECHNICIANS scrub and remove (with forceps and 
  scissors) dead tissue from Abbey s extremities. At face 
  value, the debridement process resembles a medieval torture, 
  gory and unrelenting.

  Cliff enters the room, flowers in hand.  Stunned, he studies 
  his wife: exposed cartilage where a nose once was, the 
  sensual lips bloated to clownish proportions. 

  The wretched excess splatters into a basin, MATCHING the 
    concoction in the kitchen sink. 

  He clasps his hand over his mouth, trying not to heave. 

  ABBEY S LEFT EYE opens, staring directly at him. And then... 
  from Abbey s lips, a tortured MOAN, vaguely reminiscent of 
  last night s orgy of horror. 

  Cliff BLINKS, and Abbey s eyes are once again closed. 

  Cliff bolts out of the room, scared witless.

    A stunningly SEXY WOMAN with red hair and a low-cut dress, 
  stands framed in the examination room doorway. It s TRISH, 
  the woman from the cell phone photos. Impulsive, 
    confrontational, selfish, ultra-sexed and self-absorbed,

                even call. 

                              CLIFF
                My wife might be dying. 

                              TRISH
                Did you know that your  wife  fired 
                me?

                Yes.

                Well, because of your  wife  I m a

                      (then)
                You know, I thought we had 
                  something going. 

                              CLIFF
                I didn t think you even liked me. 
                You said I was a mercy fuck. 

                              TRISH
                I was only kidding about that. 
                      (then)
                So, am I un-fired now?

  Cliff is too beaten to argue.

                O.K.

                  indiscretions. Everything is just 
                crazy right now. Do you understand? 

  Trish has relaxed, now that she s getting her job back, and 
  is soft and affectionate. 

                              TRISH
                You re a good guy, Cliff. 

  It cheers him up, a little. 

                              CLIFF
                I ve got to go meet Ira. 

                              TRISH
                OK. 

  She leans over to kiss him good-bye. She opens her mouth wide 
  to TOUNGE-KISS, slobbering his face. He EVADES. 

                              CLIFF 
                Come on, Trish!

  Trish does not appear to be stung by Cliff s rejection at 
  all.

                 Bye.

  CLIFF IS GIVING AN INTERVIEW in front of the hospital. He

  WIDER ON TRISH. We see that behind her a DENTAL PATIENT has 
  his mouth stretched wide, a glop of dental mold on a metal 
  frame instrument sticking out of his mouth. Trish is ignoring 
  him, watching television with a mixture of pride and 
    fascination. 

  Cliff returns to the room with a set of X-rays. He sees the 
  mold still in the Patient s mouth. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  26A.

                How long has that been in Mr.

                      (not looking)
                It got stuck. I was waiting for you 
                to take it out. Are you really 
                going to get all that money? 

    Irritated, Cliff turns off the television and moves to the 
  Patient. 

                              CLIFF 
                      (soothing)
                All right, Mr. Schoening, you might 
                feel some pressure. 

  Cliff tries to pull the frame which holds the hardened glop 
  in place. It won t budge. Mr. Schoening moans with pain. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                Maybe you want some gas. Would you

  Mr. Schoening nods weakly. 

  As Cliff tries to fit the gas-mask over the apparatus in Mr. 
  Schoening s mouth, Trish leans over the chair, her ample 
  breasts over Mr. Schoening s face. She whispers seductively 
  in Cliff s ear. 

                              TRISH
                How long are we going to live this

  no move to get it. Finally--

  Ira walks into Abbey s room. He sits by the edge of her bed. 
  Abbey lays with her eye open. 

                              IRA
                Well, Abbey. I came to say good-
                bye. Even though you never liked 
                me. 
                      (beat)
                You know, when I heard this awful 
                thing happened to you, the first 
                thing that jumped into my mind was, 
                 I am going to be able to buy a 
                boat.  I m not a nice guy. I admit 
                it. 

  Ira takes a glass hip flask from his inside pocket and 
  unscrews the lid. 

                              IRA (cont d)
                Still, I m sorry this had to happen 
                to you. But like I always say, when 
                life gives you a lemon, you gotta 
                make lemonade. 
                      (then)
                Here s to you Abbey. And lemonade. 

  He drinks. Abbey s pulse begins to quicken and we PUSH INTO 
  ABBEY S EYE, a hidden rage building inside her... 

  A VIDEO MONITOR--



  Cliff, stumbling inside, disoriented and disheveled. Outside 
  the hospital, we can hear protestors CHANTING  Save your 
  soul!

                broken out both condemning and

  Cliff meets Ira.

                with her.

                Sure. Meet me in the cafeteria when

  Cliff watches the breathing pattern on the monitor, follows 
  the machine to its plug in the wall.  Forlorn, he moves in 
  close to Abbey.  

                              CLIFF
                Abbey. I know I wasn t always the 
                best husband. I don t know if you 
                can find it in your heart to 
                forgive me. I m sorry for that 
                thing with Trish and the fight we 
                had. And for getting you into this 
                  situation. I just want you to 
                know... I ll always love you. 

  He presses his lips against hers. Abbey s eyelid flutters. 
  And then... Cliff feels a sting. He jumps back, a drop of 
  blood hanging his lip. And Abbey s. HE S BEEN BITTEN.

  An ALARM sounds! He turns toward the monitors. ABBEY S VITALS 
  GO COMPLETELY FLAT. 

  Within seconds, a NURSE rushes into the chamber. She presses 
  the intercom. 

                              NURSE
                She s flat-lining again! Code Blue!

  Cliff stops her.

                Wait... what do you mean she s flat-

  It s eerily silent. Cliff walks up the empty hall, agitated, 
  mind reeling. 

  The fluorescent lights above him begin to FLICKER. 

  Cliff glances at a FOOD CART of leftovers. 

  CLOSE ON: THE TRAY. The left-over pineapple chunks and gravy 
  begins to SIZZLE. 

  MOVING P.O.V. INTO CLIFF, AS HE SPINS AROUND TO SEE--

  ABBEY - YOUNG, SEXY, BEAUTIFUL, INCHES FROM HIS FACE. 

  WIDEN TO REVEAL: Cliff is alone in the hallway. There is no 
  one standing in front of him, but behind him-- 

  The double doors BURST open. 

  Cliff turns around, terrified, as the presence moves away. 

                                                                        CUT TO:



  Ira pauses to take another drink from his glass hip flask. 
  He s starting to sweat. He removes his cell phone and dials. 
  An ORDERLY is passing. 

                              ORDERLY
                Hey guy. No cell phones in the 
                  hospital. 

  When the Orderly is out of sight, Ira, irritated, looks both 
  ways then ducks into the nearest empty room--                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  32.





  Ira enters a small room off the hallway. It s quiet and dark. 
  He doesn t read the sign which reads:  CAUTION EXTREME DANGER-
  - no metal objects in the MRI room, no pace makers, no metal 
  implants, jewelry, coins...  as he moves through to--



    A spacious room with a glass window that views into the 
  control room, where the machines are operated. Ira begins to 
  dial. 

  Suddenly, the phone is HOT in his hand, SMOKING. Ira drops it  
  to the ground, shaking his burning fingers. 

                              IRA
                What the hell?!? 

    Bewildered and annoyed, Ira takes out his handkerchief and 
  folds it in his hand, preparing to pick up his cell phone. 

  Behind him, in the control room window, we see--

  ABBEY, standing pale and ghostly behind the glass. 

  CLOSE ON: The control panel, heat condensation forming inside 
  the gauges, buttons melting. The panel LIGHTS UP as the power 
  goes on. 

  Ira bends down to retrieve his device when--

  There is a SURGING SOUND and--

  Ira s cell phone FLIES across the room and SLAMS into the 
  side of the MRI machine, about six feet above the ground. 

  Ira stands for a bewildered moment, before--

  The magnets catch hold of all the metal on his body and he is 
  flung across the room and VIOLENTLY SLAMMED into the side of 
  the MRI machine, his feet dangling a foot off the ground. 

  Ira s nose is smashed and the glass flask in his pocket is 
  broken. Booze drips down his suit, down his pants leg, and 
  onto the ground. 

  He tries to move, but is held in place by the ring on his 
  finger and the watch on his wrist. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  33.

  He has been pulled with such force that the ring has cut into 
  his finger, drawing blood. 

                              IRA (cont d)
                Ow. 
                      (yelling)
                HELP! HELP! SOMEONE TURN THIS THING 
                OFF! 

  There is no answer. After a moment, Ira sets about to try to 
  free himself. He works the ring off his right hand, tearing 
  the skin from his knuckle then reaches into his jacket pocket 
  and pulls out what s left of the SHATTERED glass flask. It s 
  edges are bloody. Ira drops it to the ground below. He turns 
  his head and SCREAMS. 

  The ABBEY-THING is CRAWLING across the floor. 

  Ira begins to frantically work himself free. 

  Abbey s body gives off tremendous HEAT. She leaves a trail of 
  BLACK hand and foot prints burned into the floor behind her. 
  As she passes light bulbs overhead SHATTER. A hospital gown 
  hanging on the wall begins to SMOKE and BURN--

  The only thing holding him back is his TAG HEUER WATCH. His 
  fingers fumble with the clasp, but it s too tight, tearing at 
  his flesh... 

  Abbey MOVES CLOSER. Ira s face is covered in sweat. The EDGES 
  of his shirt begin to DARKEN and SINGE... 

  Abbey is ALMOST ON HIM, hands reaching out--

  IRA S SHIRT BURSTS INTO FLAME, igniting the soaked in 
  alcohol, just as

  THE WATCH BAND BREAKS. 

  Ira stumbles away, his chest engulfed in flame. He SLAPS at 
  the flames on his chest, FLAILING helplessly... 



  Cliff walks, troubled and forlorn, down the hallway, nursing 
  his bloody lip. Off in the distance, he hears a SCREAM. It 
  sounds like Ira. Cliff takes off RUNNING.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  34.





  There is a SCREAM of  FIRE!  The hall is filling with smoke, 
  coming from the MRI room. Cliff PULLS a FIRE EXTINGUISHER 
  from the wall and runs into--



  Ira is COMPLETELY engulfed in flames. 

  Cliff SPRAYS him with the extinguisher. 

  The ORDERLY and a few HOSPITAL WORKERS are arriving as Cliff 
  puts out the last of the fire to see--

  IRA, burned and blackened, his dead face twisted into an 
  awful SCREAM. 

                              ORDERLY
                Oh man. Oh no. 

  Cliff drops the extinguisher and RUNS out--



  The monitors come ALIVE with sounds and squiggly lines, the 
  Code Team having revived Abbey once again. Dr. Loring offers 
  her congratulations.

                              DR. LORING
                Nice work, people. 
                      (quietly)
                You live another day, Ms. Addisson. 

  Cliff BURSTS inside the room in an urgent, hysterical panic. 

                              CLIFF
                Is she alive?

                Yes, for now... 

                              CLIFF
                You ve got to save her. Please. I 
                changed my mind... she has to live. 
                      (to Abbey)
                Abbey, honey, sweet-heart, you ve 
                got to live.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  35.





  Dr. Loring and Cliff. She gives him the grim truth. 

                              DR. LORING
                Her wounds are retracting at an 
                  accelerated rate. If a matching 
                donor doesn t present itself 
                within, roughly, twelve hours, 
                surgery will be impossible. 

                              CLIFF
                What, by six a.m. tomorrow? 

                              DR. LORING
                At the latest. 

  ON A MONITOR: 

  Inside the hospital entrance, PAM is giving a tearful 
    interview. Behind her, we can see the signs of PROTESTORS, 
  spilling out into the hallway. 

                              PAM
                  Please... my baby girl is running 
                out of time. Don t let Clifford 
                Addisson murder my child... 

                              CLIFF
                      (yelling, off camera)
                Hey! I have an announcement to 
                make! 

  The cameras SWERVE to catch Cliff, RUNNING into frame. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                      (to Pam)
                You were right, Mom. 
                      (to the cameras)
                I made a terrible mistake! I am 
                  rescinding the DNR. Life is 
                  precious. Abby must stay alive no 
                matter what & if there is a 
                  settlement from Abbey s case I will 
                give it, all of it, to anyone who 
                finds her a donor.  We only have a 
                few hours left.

  Pam, standing behind him, looks strangely unhappy.

                Even if she s stuck in a bed, or a 
                  vegetable, it doesn t matter just 
                as long as she s alive. The last 
                gift I can give her... is to make 
                sure that she lives!

  The front door opens, Cliff steps into the quiet, empty room 
  and moves to--



  The patio doors are open and candles have been lit around the 
  pool. Strange. He steps out to--


  THE PATIO - CONTINUOUS

  Light bounces from the pool. Cliff walks slowly, footsteps 
  echoing. He sees something through the glass of the great 
  room, a silhouette -- ABBEY? Slowly, nervously, he steps into-



                              CLIFF
                Abbey? 

                                SILHOUETTE
                Do I look like a burnt up old 
                bitch? 

  Trish, bottle in hand, steps out into the light. 

                              CLIFF
                Oh Jesus. Trish. What are you doing 
                here? 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  37.

                      (ignoring him)
                I saw you on TV. You weren t 
                serious about giving away the 
                money, were you? 

                              CLIFF
                I really need to be alone right now 
                so I can think... 

  Trish looks at a photograph of Abbey on the mantel. Abbey is 
  young, fresh-faced and beautiful. 

                              TRISH 
                God, she was ugly. I ll bet her box 
                was wrecked. 

                              CLIFF
                No it wasn t. 

                              TRISH
                Her box was ruined. Not tight. She 
                had a loose poon. You can admit it. 

                              CLIFF
                Jesus, Trish, stop it. You ve got 
                to go. 

                              TRISH
                I ve been drinking. 

                              CLIFF

                              TRISH
                I m not leaving you alone. You are 
                  obviously having some kind of 
                  breakdown. 

  Cliff can see there s no point in arguing. 

                              CLIFF
                Fine, whatever. Just stay out of my 
                way. 

  Cliff moves to the bar and, with shaking hands, starts to fix 
  himself a drink.

                this out or Abbey s going to find a 
                way to fuck me. 

  He chugs down a triple shot. Trish moves slowly over to him. 

                              TRISH
                I don t think Abbey s in any shape

                all the things she s going to do to

                              TRISH
                Shhh, baby. 

  Trish wraps her arms around him, nuzzles his neck, and rubs 
  her hands on his chest. He looks for a moment like he might 
  succumb, then quickly pushes her hands off and moves away. 

                              CLIFF
                No! This is what started the whole

                              TRISH
                Mommy knows what you need. 

  Trish begins the sexiest walk in cinematic history towards 
  Cliff, removing her clothes as she goes. 

                              TRISH (cont d)
                You ve been starved physically. 
                Your hormones are in a tizzy. It s

  Trish is naked by the time she stops walking, squared up to 
  him, about three feet away. Cliff looks at her, torn between 
  his fear and his hunger.

                      (a whisper)

                and get out. 

  She stands in exactly the same position. Unmoving. A 
  standoff. Then he--

  LUNGES FOR HER. His lips meet hers in a desperate, sloppy, 
  starved kiss, gasping with desire, their hands all over each 
  other... 

  ANGLE FROM OVERHEAD suggesting a HOVERING P.O.V, as the two 
  of them fall to the floor, consumed with passion, and begin 
  to make love. 

  Camera MOVES DOWN, to eye level, finding the PICTURE of Abbey 
  on the mantel-- Cliff and Trish in the reflection. 



  Cliff and Trish lay together, post coital. Cliff is looking 
  over at the clock, nervously. It reads two a.m. 

                              TRISH

  Behind Cliff, who s still waiting for a response, a 
    photograph of Abbey falls from the dresser--

  --CRASH. 

  Cliff is JARRED out of his trance. The wind? Cliff gets off 
  the bed and shuts the window. He looks down at the picture on

  Cliff backs away from the window, nervous, sensing another 
  presence. A moment of SILENCE. His cell rings. He spins

  The phone is on the night stand. Waiting. Cliff picks up.

  THE MESSAGE BOARD. A new note, written in ASH, reads:

  Trish COWERS against the wall, WHIMPERING. 

  Cliff helps her up. She clings to him tightly, shivering like 
  a child, paralyzed with fear.

                You can t let her die. You can t. 
                She s got to live. No matter what. 
                You ve got to stop her. 

  Cliff, moving behind her, PICKS UP an empty wine bottle.  

                              CLIFF 
                      (almost sadly)
                I know. 

  He raises the wine bottle over his head, and...                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  44.





  Cliff opens the cabinet below the sink. Removes a COOLER, 
  emptying its contents on the floor: sponges, rolls of tin 
  foil, Mr. Clean. He rushes to the freezer and starts to fill 
  the cooler with ice. 

  He glances up at the large clock over the sink: it s just 
  after 3 a.m. 



  A pair of HANDS, shaking slightly, slip into rubber gloves.

  Steel ORAL SURGICAL TOOLS are laid out on a tray. 

  The hands release a valve attached to a canister of nitrous 
  oxide. Gas hisses through a tube. 

  CLOSE ON TRISH - A mask hooded over her mouth and nose, her 
  eyes in slits, a wound to her temple crudely tended to. 
  Feeling the first affects of the gas... Trish smiles.

  ON CLIFF, sweaty and desperate, ready for surgery. The time 
  has come. 



  Close on: the STEREO. It flicks to life, playing a MUZAK 
  version of Cliff and Abbey s WEDDING SONG. 

  CLIFF looks out into the waiting room, hearing the familiar 
  ballad. 

                              CLIFF
                Just a few hours, Abbey. Just hang 
                on. 

  Cliff picks up a nasty looking dental instrument as a 
  makeshift dermatome. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                I m sorry you have to be alive for 
                this Trish... your skin has to be 
                fresh. 

  TRISH, tied and bound to the dental chair resembling Abbey s 
  debridement session. Broken lines have been drawn in blue 
  ink, sectioning off Trish s skin like a human jigsaw puzzle. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  45.

  A steel basin lies under her head for overflow.  An extension 
  cord keeps her hands to her sides at crotch level. 

                              CLIFF (cont'd)
                Now you are going to feel a little 
                  pressure... 

  CLIFF scores a path along the broken lines with the make-
  shift dermatome.

  TRISH SCREAMS! Takes in a whiff of gas. Laughs! SLICE. She 
  screams. Cliff increases the gas. Trish is disoriented and 
  loopy. 

                              TRISH
                Do I... have a cavity? 

                              CLIFF
                Yes. It will be over soon. 

  She laughs as he cuts her again.

  The surgery almost complete... a mound of skin lays in the 
  cooler beside them, gory flaps draping over the side. 

  Cliff looks down at his watch. Wipes away the blood to see 
  that it s almost five a.m. 

  Trish looks like a page out of Gray s Anatomy, every blood-
  soaked muscle exposed.  Cliff continues to work, his scrubs 
  covered in Rorschach blotches of red.

  As for Trish... she s no longer screaming. By now, 
    everything s just too hilarious. 

  Cliff drops the skin into the cooler. His job complete, he 
  picks up an ELECTRIC CARVING KNIFE and REVS the blades.  He 
  kneels down to look into TRISH S GLASSY EYES.

                              CLIFF
                You ve very brave, Trish. I m 
                afraid this last part... doesn t 
                get any better. 

  Cliff starts the saw and brings it down towards her skinless 
  body...                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  46.

  Cliff listens to a TALK RADIO SHOW as he drives. It features 
  a MALE and a FEMALE HOST, bantering back and forth, laughing, 
  flirting, a  Frosty, Heidi & Frank  kind of deal. Cliff 
  glances at the clock on the radio: 5:25. 

                              MALE HOST (RADIO V.O.)
                I mean, we all want to control our 
                mates, but come on. First she s off 
                the ventilator, then she s on. Next 
                week she ll be off again. There s 
                gotta be a limit!

                                FEMALE HOST (RADIO V.O.)
                I ll tell you one thing. If my 
                dentist looked like Dr. Cliff, he 
                could drill me day and night, 
                honey. 

                              MALE HOST (RADIO V.O.)
                So you re publicly admitting you 
                have a thing for Dr. Cliff? Maybe 
                we should open up the phone lines 
                for this...

  Cliff shuts off the radio, miserable, and thinks back to... 
  that night.

                                                                        CUT TO:

  We follow a bloody trail along the floor and up to Cliff.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  52.





  Cliff runs in holding the cooler. A thin trickle of watery 
  ice and blood leaks out onto the floor. A NURSE recognizes 
  Cliff, who is looking desperate and disheveled. 

                              CLIFF
                Dr. Loring! I need to see Dr. 
                Loring! I ve only got fifteen 
                minutes! 

                              NURSE
                Mister Addisson... I m sorry you 
                can t... 

  Cliff RUNS past her to Abbey s room, where he can see--

  CLIFF S POV: The bed is empty. 

  He turns back to the Nurse. 

                              CLIFF
                Where is she? 

                              NURSE
                Didn t you see on the television?

                      (with dread)
                See what? 

  The Nurse turns helplessly towards--

  DR. Loring, who is stepping in from another room. 

                              DR. LORING
                Cliff, Abbey died last night. I 
                tried to call you. 
                      (off his shocked look)
                I m sorry. You might want to talk 
                to a grief counselor... 

  Cliff turns and walks back the way he came. 

                              NURSE
                Mr. Addisson? Before you go there s 
                some forms to sign... 

  He ignores them both, shuffles out.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  53.





  CLIFF Addisson, handsome and still boyish in his 30 s, is 
  behind the wheel. He s a successful dentist, affable and 
  eager to please, his  nice guy  personae covering over a deep 
  well of insecurity and weakness. Short on will power, he s a 
  slave to his impulses and selfish needs, not the least of 
  which is to be loved by everyone. He turns to his wife...

  ABBEY, a raven haired stunner in the passenger seat. What he 
  lacks in will-power she makes up for in spades. She s kind, 
  level headed, but ruthlessly stubborn when she makes up her 
  mind. She s a natural beauty; perfect nose, lips, luminous 
  skin. But right now her eyes are red and tired. 

  There is a strain between them. Cliff is trying hard to make 
  up. (NOTE: The  cut-aways  in this scene serve as a temporal 
  ellipse, giving the impression of an argument taking place 
  over time.)

  Abbey turns her attention to a pack of cigarettes, LIGHTS ONE 
  UP with an ornate lighter, then crumples the pack. 

                              CLIFF 
                Look, honey, I just...

                              ABBEY
                      (cutting him off)
                I don t want to talk about it 
                anymore. 
                      (quietly)
                This is going to be my last 
                  cigarette. I want to enjoy it. 

                              CLIFF
                You re quitting? 

  She nods. Cliff digests this surprising news. 

  ANGLE ON: the car sweeps past camera. 

  BACK TO SCENE.

                Because I want you to be around for 
                a long time. 

  Abbey rolls her eyes. 

  ANGLE ON: The tires, spinning on the blacktop. 

  WIDE ON: the road, the car s headlights moving horizontally 
  across the darkened landscape. 

  BACK TO CLIFF AND ABBEY. He s beginning to choke up. 

                              CLIFF (cont'd)
                I love you so Goddamned much, Abby. 
                I m sorry for everything. But you 
                are my wife. We are going to grow 
                old together and I m never going to 
                let you go. 

  P.O.V. - THE ONCOMING ROAD - it s empty and quiet. 

  BACK TO CLIFF AND ABBEY-- she appears to have softened. Maybe 
  Cliff is wearing her down? 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                      (quieter)

                              CLIFF
                Yes.

                      (gently)
                I want to show you something. 

  Abbey unfastens her seat belt, reaching into the back seat.

  The car sweeps by dark woods then-

  P.O.V - THE ONCOMING ROAD - A FALLEN TREE blocking the road.

  Cliff turns, seeing it at the last moment. He JERKS the 
  wheel, simultaneously hitting the brakes. A forest of fallen 
  branches SLAP the windshield. Cliff loses control. 

  ON CLIFF, AS HE SCREAMS HIS AIR BAG EXPLODES--

  ON WHITE. THERE IS A SONIC BOOM! Gnashing metal. Then 
  silence. 

  DISSOLVE onto STEAM. Through the fog, the CAMERA finds Cliff. 
  There is a gash on his head, a lot of blood and blood on the 
  airbag in front of him. He turns to the passenger seat, but 
  it s empty. There s a large hole in the windshield.  Cliff 
  begins to fumble for his seatbelt as...

  CAMERA ROTATES 180 degrees to reveal that Cliff is UPSIDE 
  DOWN, the car having flipped into a gully.



  Cliff wakes in a hospital bed. The gash in his forehead has 
  been stitched. He focuses on--

  DR. LORING, a slender young woman, leaning over him. 

                              CLIFF
                Where am I?

                              DR. LORING
                  Westchester General Hospital. You 
                were involved in a car crash, Dr. 
                  Addisson. Do you have any idea what 
                  happened?

  Cliff shakes off his initial confusion. 

                              CLIFF
                Where s Abbey?

  She takes a breath, gearing up for the hard part. 

                              DR. LORING
                I d like you to prepare yourself. 



  A pair of PATIENTS shuffle by, both badly burned. 

  Dr. Loring pushes Cliff in a wheelchair. They arrive at a set 
  of double doors, leading to a highly restricted area... THE 
  BURN UNIT. 

  Dr. Loring punches a button and the double doors SWISH open. 



  An immaculate LABORATORY, white suited TECHNICIANS monitoring 
  patients from behind glass. 

  Cliff hears a wheezing sound... artificially induced 
  respiration amplified like the breath of God. It s coming 
  from a respirator...                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  5.





  Dr. Loring opens the door. Cliff rises from the chair, 
  stepping in. On the bed before him...

  Abbey is connected to a bank of high tech MONITORS. She is 
  bandaged from head to toe, wires and tubes coiling out of 
  every orifice.

  Cliff moves to her.

                              CLIFF
                        (whispering)
                Abbey, my angel...

  Cliff leans down close and JUMPS as ABBEY JERKS in a short 
  spasm and her LEFT EYE bolts opens, the pupil wandering 
  without purpose. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                Abbey? 
                      (no answer)
                Can she hear me? 

                              DR. LORING
                No. She may seem responsive, but 
                it s just a reflex. She s not 
                  conscious. 

  Abbey fixes her good eye on Cliff and her PULSE RATE 
    increases.

                              CLIFF
                What s happening? Is she in pain?

                              DR. LORING
                With the damage to her nerves... 
                your wife doesn t see or feel 
                  anything. 

  Cliff, filled with sorrow, turns back Abbey. 

  We MOVE DIRECTLY INTO ABBEY S EYE. THE SCREEN FILLS WITH THE 
  BLACK OF HER PUPIL AND WE HEAR ABBEY CRYING OUT IN TORMENT. 



  Dr. Loring gives Cliff the rest of the bad news. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  6.

                              CLIFF
                Will she ever regain consciousness? 

                              DR. LORING
                As far as we know there s no brain 
                damage, so yes, I would say that s 
                very likely. But Abbey s rejected 
                the first round of synthetics. 

                              CLIFF
                What does that mean? 

                              DR. LORING
                We can keep her alive for a few 
                days with a temporary allograft, 
                but she s going to need a full body 
                skin graft from a matching donor.

                If a donor can be found, and the

                              CLIFF
                But not recovery. 

  She chooses her words carefully. 

                              DR. LORING
                Your wife is never going to be the 
                way she was before the accident. 

                              CLIFF
                Will she ever be able to speak? 

                              DR. LORING
                It s hard to say. Your wife may be 
                able to communicate, in one way or 
                another. There have been huge 
                advances in Brain-Computer 
                  Interfaces, she might be able to 
                type, or there are devices that 
                allow people to communicate through 
                eye movements... 

  It s all too horrible for Cliff to bear. 

                              CLIFF
                Abby loved life. That s not living. 
                She wouldn t want that.

                I ll call my lawyer.

  Cliff sits on a bench with a IRA MILSAP, Cliff s attorney, a 
    diminutive man in a power suit. 

                              IRA
                Did Abbey have a living will? 

  Cliff shakes his head  no.  

                              CLIFF
                After her father died, we had a 
                talk. She told me she wouldn t want 
                to go on. Not if she would be an 
                invalid. 

  That s what Ira was looking for. 

                              IRA
                Good enough. Sounds like her wishes 
                were clear. 

  Cliff fixes Ira with a direct, vulnerable look.

                              CLIFF 
                Ira, I want you to answer not as a 
                lawyer, but as a friend: is this 
                the right thing to do? 

                              IRA
                Yes. Absolutely. 

                              CLIFF
                How can you be sure? 

                              IRA
                Abbey bought your house because she 
                looked good in it.  She liked 
                things to be beautiful.  She 
                wouldn t want to live looking like 
                a... 
                      (Cliff looks horrified)
                Not to be insensitive. The 
                  important thing is for you not to 
                feel guilty. It was an accident. 

  Cliff does not look consoled. He begins a confession. 

                              CLIFF
                You know the worst part? Our last 
                days together weren t happy. 
                      (then)
                  I cheated on her. And then I 
                crashed her into a tree. Those are 
                the last things I ll ever do for my 
                wife. 

                              IRA
                The last thing you can do for her 
                is to be strong. That s the last 
                gift you can give her. 
                      (then)
                Cliff, everyone makes mistakes. She 
                would have forgiven you. 

                              CLIFF
                        (doubtfully)
                You didn t really know her. 
                      (then)
                Abbey could be... unbelievably 
                  stubborn. 

  Cliff drifts off into a tortured reminiscence. 





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  9.

                You know, when we first got 
                married, we were so happy. 
                      (near tears)
                We used to make love... in the

  Ira doesn t want to hear the rest.

                      (disgusted)
                I really gotta be going. 

  Ira stands, eager to get out. Cliff stands to shake. 

                              CLIFF

  We pan from across the great room, a bank of windows display 
  an in-ground pool, on the interior, feminine decoration, a 
  woman s touch. Cliff enters. 

  The house surrounds Cliff, huge and empty. Cliff drops his 
  luggage and moves inside. 



  Curtains sway in the breeze, casting shadows across the room. 

  On a shelf sits a JEWELRY BOX. Cliff opens it and a miniature 
  couple dances to the melody of Cliff and Abbey s WEDDING 
  SONG. Cliff stands, listening.  A WINE GLASS, which had been 
  sitting on the shelf, falls to the floor, as if by its own 
  volition.  Cliff closes the box.  He hears SPLASH.

                              CLIFF
                Abbey?

  Cliff moves to the window and looks sadly out to the pool.   
  He JUMPS as--BAM! A bird hits the window. Cliff looks down at 
  the bird, laying dead on the steps outside. 

                                                                        CUT TO:



  The light comes on. Cliff shuffles in, wearing sweats. A 
  handwritten note on an erasable message board reads:

                      Wake me up at 7.

                                 -A

  Cliff opens a cabinet filled with canned goods. He removes a 
  Dinty More-style stew, empties it into a pot, and places it 
  on to a gas stove, igniting the pilot. He moves off. SHOT 
  HOLDS ON THE STEW... bubbling to a boil.



  A lonesome, modern space. 

  Cliff sits, forlorn, his mind drifting... 



  Cliff is searching behind the sofa cushions. Abbey steps in 
  from behind, something in her hand. 

                              CLIFF
                      (without turning)
                I ve got to call Ted and tell him

                      (quietly)
                Yes. I have. 

  He turns to see that she s holding it in her hand. From the 
  phone s tinny speakers comes a sexy LAUGH. Cliff s face FALLS 
  as Abbey watches a video on the tiny screen...

  ANGLE ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN - VIDEO

  A sexy REDHEADED WOMAN removes her top. She SPINS and

  BACK TO SCENE 

  Cliff moves towards Abbey, stammering. 

                              CLIFF
                That just came over the internet. 
                Video spam... what will they think 
                of next?

  Abbey, not listening, eyes fixed on--

  An unseen man s arm fondles her while she laughs. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                I think it s an ad for a sex pill. 

  CELL PHONE SCREEN - VIDEO

  Cliff moves into the shot and suckles the woman s breast. 

  BACK TO SCENE

  Cliff advances towards Abbey, still trying to be  casual.   
  From the tinny speakers come moans of ecstacy.

                              CLIFF (cont'd)

                Maybe she s moonlighting as a

  Cliff reaches Abbey and holds out his hand.  She ignores him,

  Cliff looks into Abbey s eyes and knows that lying is 
  pointless -- he s busted.

                I hope she was worth it. 

  Abbey, disgusted, drops the phone to the floor. 



  Cliff returns, looks around. The stew-- what s left of it-- 
  sizzles from the stove. He grabs the SMOKING pot, burning his 
  hand on the handle. He pivots, dropping it onto a cutting 
  board. 

  His attention is drawn to the message board where only two 
  words remain in dripping black ink:

                        Wake me 


  AT THE SINK

  Cliff scrapes the stew from the bottom of the pot. The 
  gristled meat and burnt gravy spiral into the strainer. 



  Abbey s room is silent except for her labored breathing and 
  the BLIPS and HUM of the machines. 

  The BLIPS slow as her pulse begins to fall and--

  STOPS. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  13.

  An ALARM goes off. After a moment a NURSE RUNS inside.

                DOCTOR! 



  The bath is running.

  Cliff removes his watch, placing it on the ledge, the time 
  exactly 11:02 PM. He lowers himself into the water. A pang of 
  discomfort. Cliff adjusts. Sighs. That s better. He closes 
  his eyes. 



  (SOMEONE S) POINT OF VIEW drifts through the darkness. (It) 
  pauses momentarily to admire a collection of FAMILY PHOTOS... 
  before MOVING on. 

  P.O.V approaches the STEREO CABINET. A CD Player lights up. 
  The track skips ahead to  4 . Abbey and Cliff s WEDDING SONG, 
  the same one we heard from the jewelry box.



  Cliff hums along from his semi-conscious state. 

  ANGLE ON: A small pool of water on the tile floor BOILS into 
  steam and disappears. 



  The doctor injects a syringe into Abbey, trying to revive 
  her. He waits for a response then- 

                                DOCTOR
                No good. Defibrillator!

  Laying in the tub. Abruptly, the water level RISES to his 
  chin. Someone-- or thing-- has entered the bath.

  Cliff opens his eyes.



  ABBEY is in the tub across from him, young and perfect, her 
  bare breasts glistening above the water line.


  SUNKEN TUB - FAVORED ANGLES

  Cliff sits up, entranced.

                Abbey. 

  She rises to reveal herself, achingly beautiful, the 
  Honeymoon spoils. She moves towards Cliff and

  Straddles him. 

  Cliff GASPS as-- 

  She reaches between his legs and begins pumping. 

  He tilts his head back, eyes closed. Enraptured.

  Then a CHANGE takes place. Her once flawless skin boils with 
  BLISTERS, turning a crisp umber. 


  ON CLIFF 

  panting, his eyes in slits, remains unaware. 


  ABBEY S FACE

  turns charcoal black. 


  SUNKEN TUB - FAVORED ANGLES

  Cliff is SWEPT AWAY in the moment, when a BOILED BLOB OF 
  MELTED FLESH lands in his mouth. 

  Cliff gags, opening his eyes to find... the monstrous 
  facsimile of his wife, the ABBEY-THING.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  15.

  Cliff fights to remove her, his arms JERKING.  He grabs at 
  her arm.  Her skin sloughs off under his fingers.

  The Abbey-thing overpowers him, a voracious sexual assault.

  Cliff SCREAMS. 




  NEW ANGLE

  From one instant to the next... Cliff finds himself alone, 
  the water gone. And Abbey with it. Did it actually happen? 
  Cliff sits, gasping, spent and frightened like a baby. 



  Abbey s heart is beating again. The Doctor takes the 
    defibrillator pads from her body as the STAFF celebrate their 
    success--cheers, high fives all around.



  Cliff, in the tub, hears a sound, a MELODY, coming from the 
  bedroom. He pulls himself from the tub, grabs a towel, and 
  steps out into--



  Cliff looks to a small shelf outside the bathroom where THE 
  JEWELRY BOX IS OPEN, the tiny couple spinning, playing their 
  song. There s a framed photo next to the jewelry box: CLIFF 
  AND ABBEY S WEDDING PICTURE. SHOT PUSHES IN ON ABBEY S FACE, 
    a pleasant smile, innocent at the time. Tonight... it s taken 
  on a whole new meaning.

  Cliff closes the music box then moves back to...



  Stepping back inside, Cliff catches his reflection in a LARGE 
  MIRROR. He stops and stares because--






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  16.

  CLIFF S P.O.V. - MIRROR

  There are RED MARKS on his back, like handprints, where 
   Abbey s ghost  touched him. 

  Cliff TURNS. In the mirror TWO RED CIRCLES are revealed on 
  his chest, right about where her breasts would have touched 
  him.  

  PUSH INTO CLIFF as, with rising dread, he drops the towel 
  from his waist, staring with horror at his lower regions... 



  Cliff holds the phone to his ear. He s in a nervous panic, 
    periodically examining the red marks in a mirror. 

                                                                INTERCUT WITH:

  A very sleepy IRA lays in bed, trying to talk some sense into 
  Cliff.

                couldn t it be a ghost? Come on. 
                Why?

                              CLIFF
                  Because... Abbey s still alive.

  Ira hangs up. 

  The doorbell RINGS. Then again. At this hour? Cliff heads 
  downstairs. 

  Cliff opens the door to reveal: 



  Cliff shuffles towards the whistling kettle and makes himself 
  a cup of tea. A news channel plays its morning show in the 
  living room. A FAMILIAR VOICE cuts through the din of the 
  news. With trepidation, Cliff moves to the--



  On the television, Abbey s mother, Pam, is giving a teary-
  eyed interview in front of the hospital. 

                              PAM
                      (on the television)
                ...he was probably drunk when he 
                crashed that car. He always hated 
                her. He was abusive. At family 
                dinners he would... 
                      (choke)
                ...slap me, if I said anything.
                      (then)
                I just pray to Jesus not to let 
                that man take my daughter from me 
                forever. 

  Clifford stands, stunned. Pam does a fantastic job of playing 
  the sensitive, wounded mother.

                      (off screen)
                So you think Abbey would want to be 
                kept alive, no matter what. 

                              PAM

                I know she would, John. God should

  AT THE FRONT DOOR-

  Cliff heads out, looking behind him at the empty interior.




  ABBEY, ON A TILT TABLE

  suspended upright, her grisly visage fully unwrapped, 
  matching the thing that visited Cliff last night. 

  A pair of TECHNICIANS scrub and remove (with forceps and 
  scissors) dead tissue from Abbey s extremities. At face 
  value, the debridement process resembles a medieval torture, 
  gory and unrelenting.

  Cliff enters the room, flowers in hand.  Stunned, he studies 
  his wife: exposed cartilage where a nose once was, the 
  sensual lips bloated to clownish proportions. 

  The wretched excess splatters into a basin, MATCHING the 
    concoction in the kitchen sink. 

  He clasps his hand over his mouth, trying not to heave. 

  ABBEY S LEFT EYE opens, staring directly at him. And then... 
  from Abbey s lips, a tortured MOAN, vaguely reminiscent of 
  last night s orgy of horror. 

  Cliff BLINKS, and Abbey s eyes are once again closed. 

  Cliff bolts out of the room, scared witless.

  to hold himself up.

                Where have you been? 

  Cliff turns to see--

    A stunningly SEXY WOMAN with red hair and a low-cut dress, 
  stands framed in the examination room doorway. It s TRISH, 
  the woman from the cell phone photos. Impulsive, 
    confrontational, selfish, ultra-sexed and self-absorbed, 
  Trish only values what she can t have. 

                              CLIFF
                Trish. I was in the hospital for a 
                few days. As I m sure you know, 
                Abbey is in critical condition...

                you re done.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  30.





  Cliff watches the breathing pattern on the monitor, follows 
  the machine to its plug in the wall.  Forlorn, he moves in 
  close to Abbey.  

                              CLIFF
                Abbey. I know I wasn t always the 
                best husband. I don t know if you 
                can find it in your heart to 
                forgive me. I m sorry for that 
                thing with Trish and the fight we 
                had. And for getting you into this 
                  situation. I just want you to 
                know... I ll always love you. 

  He presses his lips against hers. Abbey s eyelid flutters. 
  And then... Cliff feels a sting. He jumps back, a drop of 
  blood hanging his lip. And Abbey s. HE S BEEN BITTEN.

  An ALARM sounds! He turns toward the monitors. ABBEY S VITALS 
  GO COMPLETELY FLAT. 

  Within seconds, a NURSE rushes into the chamber. She presses 
  the intercom. 

                              NURSE
                She s flat-lining again! Code Blue! 
                Page Dr. Loring! 

  The Nurse leads Cliff out as the BURN UNIT TEAM rushes in 
  past them... 

                              NURSE (cont'd)
                This way, Dr. Addisson.


  Cliff stops her. 

                              CLIFF
                Wait... what do you mean she s flat-
                lining again? 

                              NURSE
                They called a code on her last 
                night. She was revived quickly and 
                seemed to stabilize...

  The Nurse turns and goes back into the room.

  It s eerily silent. Cliff walks up the empty hall, agitated, 
  mind reeling. 

  The fluorescent lights above him begin to FLICKER. 

  Cliff glances at a FOOD CART of leftovers. 

  CLOSE ON: THE TRAY. The left-over pineapple chunks and gravy 
  begins to SIZZLE. 

  MOVING P.O.V. INTO CLIFF, AS HE SPINS AROUND TO SEE--

  ABBEY - YOUNG, SEXY, BEAUTIFUL, INCHES FROM HIS FACE. 

  WIDEN TO REVEAL: Cliff is alone in the hallway. There is no 
  one standing in front of him, but behind him-- 

  The double doors BURST open. 

  Cliff turns around, terrified, as the presence moves away. 

                                                                        CUT TO:



  Ira pauses to take another drink from his glass hip flask. 
  He s starting to sweat. He removes his cell phone and dials. 
  An ORDERLY is passing. 

                              ORDERLY
                Hey guy. No cell phones in the 
                  hospital. 

  When the Orderly is out of sight, Ira, irritated, looks both 
  ways then ducks into the nearest empty room--                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  32.





  Ira enters a small room off the hallway. It s quiet and dark. 
  He doesn t read the sign which reads:  CAUTION EXTREME DANGER-
  - no metal objects in the MRI room, no pace makers, no metal 
  implants, jewelry, coins...  as he moves through to--



    A spacious room with a glass window that views into the 
  control room, where the machines are operated. Ira begins to 
  dial. 

  Suddenly, the phone is HOT in his hand, SMOKING. Ira drops it  
  to the ground, shaking his burning fingers. 

                              IRA
                What the hell?!? 

    Bewildered and annoyed, Ira takes out his handkerchief and 
  folds it in his hand, preparing to pick up his cell phone. 

  Behind him, in the control room window, we see--

  ABBEY, standing pale and ghostly behind the glass. 

  CLOSE ON: The control panel, heat condensation forming inside 
  the gauges, buttons melting. The panel LIGHTS UP as the power 
  goes on. 

  Ira bends down to retrieve his device when--

  There is a SURGING SOUND and--

  Ira s cell phone FLIES across the room and SLAMS into the 
  side of the MRI machine, about six feet above the ground. 

  Ira stands for a bewildered moment, before--

  The magnets catch hold of all the metal on his body and he is 
  flung across the room and VIOLENTLY SLAMMED into the side of 
  the MRI machine, his feet dangling a foot off the ground. 

  Ira s nose is smashed and the glass flask in his pocket is 
  broken. Booze drips down his suit, down his pants leg, and 
  onto the ground. 

  He tries to move, but is held in place by the ring on his 
  finger and the watch on his wrist. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  33.

    CONTINUED:5454

  He has been pulled with such force that the ring has cut into 
  his finger, drawing blood. 

                              IRA (cont d)
                Ow. 
                      (yelling)
                HELP! HELP! SOMEONE TURN THIS THING 
                OFF! 

  There is no answer. After a moment, Ira sets about to try to 
  free himself. He works the ring off his right hand, tearing 
  the skin from his knuckle then reaches into his jacket pocket 
  and pulls out what s left of the SHATTERED glass flask. It s 
  edges are bloody. Ira drops it to the ground below. He turns 
  his head and SCREAMS. 

  The ABBEY-THING is CRAWLING across the floor. 

  Ira begins to frantically work himself free. 

  Abbey s body gives off tremendous HEAT. She leaves a trail of 
  BLACK hand and foot prints burned into the floor behind her. 
  As she passes light bulbs overhead SHATTER. A hospital gown 
  hanging on the wall begins to SMOKE and BURN--

  The only thing holding him back is his TAG HEUER WATCH. His 
  fingers fumble with the clasp, but it s too tight, tearing at 
  his flesh... 

  Abbey MOVES CLOSER. Ira s face is covered in sweat. The EDGES 
  of his shirt begin to DARKEN and SINGE... 

  Abbey is ALMOST ON HIM, hands reaching out--

  IRA S SHIRT BURSTS INTO FLAME, igniting the soaked in 
  alcohol, just as

  THE WATCH BAND BREAKS. 

  Ira stumbles away, his chest engulfed in flame. He SLAPS at 
  the flames on his chest, FLAILING helplessly... 



  Cliff walks, troubled and forlorn, down the hallway, nursing 
  his bloody lip. Off in the distance, he hears a SCREAM. It 
  sounds like Ira. Cliff takes off RUNNING.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  34.





  There is a SCREAM of  FIRE!  The hall is filling with smoke, 
  coming from the MRI room. Cliff PULLS a FIRE EXTINGUISHER 
  from the wall and runs into--



  Ira is COMPLETELY engulfed in flames. 

  Cliff SPRAYS him with the extinguisher. 

  The ORDERLY and a few HOSPITAL WORKERS are arriving as Cliff 
  puts out the last of the fire to see--

  IRA, burned and blackened, his dead face twisted into an 
  awful SCREAM. 

                              ORDERLY
                Oh man. Oh no. 

  Cliff drops the extinguisher and RUNS out--



  The monitors come ALIVE with sounds and squiggly lines, the 
  Code Team having revived Abbey once again. Dr. Loring offers 
  her congratulations.

                              DR. LORING
                Nice work, people. 
                      (quietly)
                You live another day, Ms. Addisson. 

  Cliff BURSTS inside the room in an urgent, hysterical panic. 

                              CLIFF
                Is she alive? 

                              DR. LORING
                Yes, for now... 

                              CLIFF
                You ve got to save her. Please. I 
                changed my mind... she has to live. 
                      (to Abbey)
                Abbey, honey, sweet-heart, you ve 
                got to live.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  35.





  Dr. Loring and Cliff. She gives him the grim truth. 

                              DR. LORING
                Her wounds are retracting at an 
                  accelerated rate. If a matching 
                donor doesn t present itself 
                within, roughly, twelve hours, 
                surgery will be impossible. 

                              CLIFF
                What, by six a.m. tomorrow? 

                              DR. LORING
                At the latest. 

  ON A MONITOR: 

  Inside the hospital entrance, PAM is giving a tearful 
    interview. Behind her, we can see the signs of PROTESTORS, 
  spilling out into the hallway. 

                              PAM
                  Please... my baby girl is running 
                out of time. Don t let Clifford

                Hey! I have an announcement to 
                make! 

  The cameras SWERVE to catch Cliff, RUNNING into frame. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                      (to Pam)
                You were right, Mom. 
                      (to the cameras)
                I made a terrible mistake! I am 
                  rescinding the DNR. Life is 
                  precious. Abby must stay alive no 
                matter what & if there is a 
                  settlement from Abbey s case I will 
                give it, all of it, to anyone who 
                finds her a donor.  We only have a 
                few hours left.

  Pam, standing behind him, looks strangely unhappy.

                  vegetable, it doesn t matter just 
                as long as she s alive. The last 
                gift I can give her... is to make 
                sure that she lives!

  The front door opens, Cliff steps into the quiet, empty room 
  and moves to--



  The patio doors are open and candles have been lit around the 
  pool. Strange. He steps out to--


  THE PATIO - CONTINUOUS

  Light bounces from the pool. Cliff walks slowly, footsteps 
  echoing. He sees something through the glass of the great 
  room, a silhouette -- ABBEY? Slowly, nervously, he steps into-



                              CLIFF
                Abbey? 

                                SILHOUETTE
                Do I look like a burnt up old 
                bitch? 

  Trish, bottle in hand, steps out into the light. 

                              CLIFF
                Oh Jesus. Trish. What are you doing 
                here?

                money, were you?

                I really need to be alone right now 
                so I can think... 

  Trish looks at a photograph of Abbey on the mantel. Abbey is 
  young, fresh-faced and beautiful. 

                              TRISH 
                God, she was ugly. I ll bet her box 
                was wrecked.

                No it wasn t. 

                              TRISH
                Her box was ruined. Not tight. She 
                had a loose poon. You can admit it. 

                              CLIFF
                Jesus, Trish, stop it. You ve got

                  obviously having some kind of 
                  breakdown. 

  Cliff can see there s no point in arguing. 

                              CLIFF
                Fine, whatever. Just stay out of my 
                way. 

  Cliff moves to the bar and, with shaking hands, starts to fix 
  himself a drink.

  Trish wraps her arms around him, nuzzles his neck, and rubs 
  her hands on his chest. He looks for a moment like he might 
  succumb, then quickly pushes her hands off and moves away. 

                              CLIFF

                Mommy knows what you need. 

  Trish begins the sexiest walk in cinematic history towards 
  Cliff, removing her clothes as she goes.

  Trish is naked by the time she stops walking, squared up to 
  him, about three feet away. Cliff looks at her, torn between 
  his fear and his hunger.

  She stands in exactly the same position. Unmoving. A 
  standoff. Then he--

  LUNGES FOR HER. His lips meet hers in a desperate, sloppy, 
  starved kiss, gasping with desire, their hands all over each 
  other... 

  ANGLE FROM OVERHEAD suggesting a HOVERING P.O.V, as the two

  Camera MOVES DOWN, to eye level, finding the PICTURE of Abbey 
  on the mantel-- Cliff and Trish in the reflection. 



  Cliff and Trish lay together, post coital. Cliff is looking 
  over at the clock, nervously. It reads two a.m. 

                              TRISH 
                Why are you staring at the clock? 

                              CLIFF
                I can t help it. 

                              TRISH
                You know you re being crazy, right? 

                              CLIFF
                I... guess.

                bucket, nothing s gonna happen.

                I? You re too smart for me.

  She kisses him on the lips, sweetly & gets out of bed, still 
  naked, and grabs his shirt.

                              CLIFF
                Where are you going? 

                              TRISH
                To get another bottle of wine, if 
                that s O.K. 

  Cliff s gaze falls to: the bathroom. He slips into a 
    flashback. 



  Cliff stands outside the bathroom door.

                Abbey?

                        concerned)
                Please answer me. 

  Still no answer.

  Abbey stands on the other side of the door, tears on her 
  cheeks. He speaks gently. 

                              CLIFF

                  I cleared the weekend. I thought we 
                might take a drive to the cabin. 

  Abbey is looking down at something in her hand. CLOSE ON THE 
  ITEM: It is a HOME PREGNANCY TEST WAND.

                      (softly)
                Like old times, huh? 

  ON CLIFF: 

                              CLIFF
                What? What did you say? 

  A moment later the door opens. Abbey stands framed in the 
  doorway. 

                              ABBEY
                O.K. Let s take a drive. 

  On Cliff s face, a ray of hope. 

  END FLASHBACK. 

  Behind Cliff, who s still waiting for a response, a 
    photograph of Abbey falls from the dresser--

  --CRASH. 

  Cliff is JARRED out of his trance. The wind? Cliff gets off 
  the bed and shuts the window. He looks down at the picture on 
  the ground, the glass cracked over Abbey s face. 



  Trish enters and starts looking through the wine rack. 

                                                                        CUT TO:

  glides along the upstairs hall, finds Trish, beginning to 
  sweat as she goes looking for a cork-screw and some glasses. 



  Cliff backs away from the window, nervous, sensing another 
  presence. A moment of SILENCE. His cell rings. He spins 
  around. 

  The phone is on the night stand. Waiting. Cliff picks up.

                              CLIFF
                Hello?

  A picture materializes. Cliff looks down at the receiver.

  A self portrait of Trish, initiating a striptease from the 
  kitchen, one arm covering her breasts.


  SECOND SHOT

  Trish flashes her left breast.

  something else in the frame. His smile disappears.

  A blank FRAME... accompanied by TRISH S (off screen) SCREAM!

  CLIFF RUNS. 



  Cliff, RUNS into the kitchen. He sees something that stops 
  him in his tracks--

  THE MESSAGE BOARD. A new note, written in ASH, reads:

                       skin 

  Trish COWERS against the wall, WHIMPERING. 

  Cliff helps her up. She clings to him tightly, shivering like 
  a child, paralyzed with fear. 

                              TRISH
                Is she... still here? 

                              CLIFF
                I don t thinks so. They must have 
                revived her again. 

                              TRISH
                Oh God. It was awful. That burning 
                smell...  Please... protect me. 

  He begins to lead her out. 

                              TRISH (cont'd)
                You can t let her die. You can t. 
                She s got to live. No matter what. 
                You ve got to stop her. 

  Cliff, moving behind her, PICKS UP an empty wine bottle.  

                              CLIFF 
                      (almost sadly)
                I know. 

  He raises the wine bottle over his head, and...                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  44.





  Cliff opens the cabinet below the sink. Removes a COOLER, 
  emptying its contents on the floor: sponges, rolls of tin 
  foil, Mr. Clean. He rushes to the freezer and starts to fill 
  the cooler with ice. 

  He glances up at the large clock over the sink: it s just 
  after 3 a.m. 



  A pair of HANDS, shaking slightly, slip into rubber gloves.

  Steel ORAL SURGICAL TOOLS are laid out on a tray. 

  The hands release a valve attached to a canister of nitrous 
  oxide. Gas hisses through a tube. 

  CLOSE ON TRISH - A mask hooded over her mouth and nose, her 
  eyes in slits, a wound to her temple crudely tended to. 
  Feeling the first affects of the gas... Trish smiles.

  ON CLIFF, sweaty and desperate, ready for surgery. The time 
  has come. 



  Close on: the STEREO. It flicks to life, playing a MUZAK 
  version of Cliff and Abbey s WEDDING SONG. 

  CLIFF looks out into the waiting room, hearing the familiar 
  ballad. 

                              CLIFF
                Just a few hours, Abbey. Just hang 
                on. 

  Cliff picks up a nasty looking dental instrument as a 
  makeshift dermatome. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                I m sorry you have to be alive for 
                this Trish... your skin has to be 
                fresh. 

  TRISH, tied and bound to the dental chair resembling Abbey s 
  debridement session. Broken lines have been drawn in blue 
  ink, sectioning off Trish s skin like a human jigsaw puzzle.

  A steel basin lies under her head for overflow.  An extension

                Now you are going to feel a little 
                  pressure... 

  CLIFF scores a path along the broken lines with the make-
  shift dermatome.

  TRISH SCREAMS! Takes in a whiff of gas. Laughs! SLICE. She 
  screams. Cliff increases the gas. Trish is disoriented and 
  loopy. 

                              TRISH
                Do I... have a cavity? 

                              CLIFF
                Yes. It will be over soon. 

  She laughs as he cuts her again.

  The surgery almost complete... a mound of skin lays in the 
  cooler beside them, gory flaps draping over the side. 

  Cliff looks down at his watch. Wipes away the blood to see 
  that it s almost five a.m. 

  Trish looks like a page out of Gray s Anatomy, every blood-
  soaked muscle exposed.  Cliff continues to work, his scrubs 
  covered in Rorschach blotches of red.

  As for Trish... she s no longer screaming. By now, 
    everything s just too hilarious. 

  Cliff drops the skin into the cooler. His job complete, he 
  picks up an ELECTRIC CARVING KNIFE and REVS the blades.  He 
  kneels down to look into TRISH S GLASSY EYES.

                              CLIFF
                You ve very brave, Trish. I m 
                afraid this last part... doesn t 
                get any better. 

  Cliff starts the saw and brings it down towards her skinless 
  body...                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  46.

  Cliff listens to a TALK RADIO SHOW as he drives. It features 
  a MALE and a FEMALE HOST, bantering back and forth, laughing, 
  flirting, a  Frosty, Heidi & Frank  kind of deal. Cliff 
  glances at the clock on the radio: 5:25. 

                              MALE HOST (RADIO V.O.)
                I mean, we all want to control our 
                mates, but come on. First she s off 
                the ventilator, then she s on. Next 
                week she ll be off again. There s 
                gotta be a limit!

                                FEMALE HOST (RADIO V.O.)
                I ll tell you one thing. If my 
                dentist looked like Dr. Cliff, he 
                could drill me day and night, 
                honey. 

                              MALE HOST (RADIO V.O.)
                So you re publicly admitting you 
                have a thing for Dr. Cliff? Maybe 
                we should open up the phone lines 
                for this...

  Cliff shuts off the radio, miserable, and thinks back to... 
  that night.

                                                                        CUT TO:

  Cliff runs in holding the cooler. A thin trickle of watery 
  ice and blood leaks out onto the floor. A NURSE recognizes 
  Cliff, who is looking desperate and disheveled.

  He turns back to the Nurse.

  The Nurse turns helplessly towards--

  DR. Loring, who is stepping in from another room. 

                              DR. LORING
                Cliff, Abbey died last night. I 
                tried to call you. 
                      (off his shocked look)
                I m sorry. You might want to talk 
                to a grief counselor... 

  Cliff turns and walks back the way he came. 

                              NURSE
                Mr. Addisson? Before you go there s 
                some forms to sign... 

  He ignores them both, shuffles out.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  53.





  Cliff wakes in a hospital bed. The gash in his forehead has 
  been stitched. He focuses on--

  DR. LORING, a slender young woman, leaning over him. 

                              CLIFF
                Where am I?

                              DR. LORING
                  Westchester General Hospital. You 
                were involved in a car crash, Dr. 
                  Addisson. Do you have any idea what 
                  happened?

  Cliff shakes off his initial confusion. 

                              CLIFF
                Where s Abbey?

  She takes a breath, gearing up for the hard part. 

                              DR. LORING
                I d like you to prepare yourself. 



  A pair of PATIENTS shuffle by, both badly burned. 

  Dr. Loring pushes Cliff in a wheelchair. They arrive at a set 
  of double doors, leading to a highly restricted area... THE 
  BURN UNIT. 

  Dr. Loring punches a button and the double doors SWISH open. 



  An immaculate LABORATORY, white suited TECHNICIANS monitoring 
  patients from behind glass. 

  Cliff hears a wheezing sound... artificially induced 
  respiration amplified like the breath of God. It s coming 
  from a respirator...                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  5.





  Dr. Loring opens the door. Cliff rises from the chair, 
  stepping in. On the bed before him...

  Abbey is connected to a bank of high tech MONITORS. She is 
  bandaged from head to toe, wires and tubes coiling out of 
  every orifice.

  Cliff moves to her.

                              CLIFF
                        (whispering)
                Abbey, my angel...

  Cliff leans down close and JUMPS as ABBEY JERKS in a short 
  spasm and her LEFT EYE bolts opens, the pupil wandering 
  without purpose. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                Abbey? 
                      (no answer)
                Can she hear me? 

                              DR. LORING
                No. She may seem responsive, but 
                it s just a reflex. She s not 
                  conscious. 

  Abbey fixes her good eye on Cliff and her PULSE RATE 
    increases.

                              CLIFF
                What s happening? Is she in pain?

                              DR. LORING
                With the damage to her nerves... 
                your wife doesn t see or feel 
                  anything. 

  Cliff, filled with sorrow, turns back Abbey. 

  We MOVE DIRECTLY INTO ABBEY S EYE. THE SCREEN FILLS WITH THE 
  BLACK OF HER PUPIL AND WE HEAR ABBEY CRYING OUT IN TORMENT. 



  Dr. Loring gives Cliff the rest of the bad news.

                As far as we know there s no brain 
                damage, so yes, I would say that s 
                very likely. But Abbey s rejected 
                the first round of synthetics.

                What does that mean?

                We can keep her alive for a few 
                days with a temporary allograft, 
                but she s going to need a full body 
                skin graft from a matching donor. 
                      (then)
                If a donor can be found, and the 
                  operation is successful... she ll 
                have a good chance at survival.

  She chooses her words carefully. 

                              DR. LORING
                Your wife is never going to be the 
                way she was before the accident. 

                              CLIFF
                Will she ever be able to speak? 

                              DR. LORING
                It s hard to say. Your wife may be 
                able to communicate, in one way or 
                another. There have been huge 
                advances in Brain-Computer 
                  Interfaces, she might be able to 
                type, or there are devices that 
                allow people to communicate through 
                eye movements... 

  It s all too horrible for Cliff to bear. 

                              CLIFF
                Abby loved life. That s not living. 
                She wouldn t want that.

                  Obtaining a Do Not Resuscitate 
                order usually takes some time. 
                Until then, we have to do 
                  everything we can to keep her 
                alive. 

  Cliff nods, sadly.

  Cliff sits on a bench with a IRA MILSAP, Cliff s attorney, a 
    diminutive man in a power suit. 

                              IRA
                Did Abbey have a living will? 

  Cliff shakes his head  no.  

                              CLIFF
                After her father died, we had a 
                talk. She told me she wouldn t want 
                to go on. Not if she would be an 
                invalid. 

  That s what Ira was looking for. 

                              IRA
                Good enough. Sounds like her wishes 
                were clear. 

  Cliff fixes Ira with a direct, vulnerable look.

                Ira, I want you to answer not as a 
                lawyer, but as a friend: is this 
                the right thing to do? 

                              IRA
                Yes. Absolutely. 

                              CLIFF
                How can you be sure? 

                              IRA
                Abbey bought your house because she 
                looked good in it.  She liked 
                things to be beautiful.  She 
                wouldn t want to live looking like 
                a... 
                      (Cliff looks horrified)
                Not to be insensitive. The 
                  important thing is for you not to 
                feel guilty. It was an accident. 

  Cliff does not look consoled. He begins a confession. 

                              CLIFF
                You know the worst part? Our last 
                days together weren t happy. 
                      (then)
                  I cheated on her. And then I 
                crashed her into a tree. Those are 
                the last things I ll ever do for my 
                wife. 

                              IRA
                The last thing you can do for her 
                is to be strong. That s the last 
                gift you can give her. 
                      (then)
                Cliff, everyone makes mistakes. She 
                would have forgiven you. 

                              CLIFF
                        (doubtfully)
                You didn t really know her.

                Abbey could be... unbelievably 
                  stubborn. 

  Cliff drifts off into a tortured reminiscence. 





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  9.

                We used to make love... in the

  Ira stands, eager to get out. Cliff stands to shake.

  We pan from across the great room, a bank of windows display 
  an in-ground pool, on the interior, feminine decoration, a 
  woman s touch. Cliff enters. 

  The house surrounds Cliff, huge and empty. Cliff drops his 
  luggage and moves inside. 



  Curtains sway in the breeze, casting shadows across the room. 

  On a shelf sits a JEWELRY BOX. Cliff opens it and a miniature 
  couple dances to the melody of Cliff and Abbey s WEDDING 
  SONG. Cliff stands, listening.  A WINE GLASS, which had been 
  sitting on the shelf, falls to the floor, as if by its own 
  volition.  Cliff closes the box.  He hears SPLASH.

                              CLIFF
                Abbey?

  Cliff moves to the window and looks sadly out to the pool.   
  He JUMPS as--BAM! A bird hits the window. Cliff looks down at 
  the bird, laying dead on the steps outside. 

                                                                        CUT TO:



  The light comes on. Cliff shuffles in, wearing sweats. A 
  handwritten note on an erasable message board reads:

                      Wake me up at 7.

                                 -A

  Cliff opens a cabinet filled with canned goods. He removes a 
  Dinty More-style stew, empties it into a pot, and places it 
  on to a gas stove, igniting the pilot. He moves off. SHOT 
  HOLDS ON THE STEW... bubbling to a boil.



  A lonesome, modern space. 

  Cliff sits, forlorn, his mind drifting... 



  Cliff is searching behind the sofa cushions. Abbey steps in 
  from behind, something in her hand. 

                              CLIFF
                      (without turning)
                I ve got to call Ted and tell him 
                we won t be making their party. You

                      (quietly)
                Yes. I have. 

  He turns to see that she s holding it in her hand. From the 
  phone s tinny speakers comes a sexy LAUGH. Cliff s face FALLS 
  as Abbey watches a video on the tiny screen...

  ANGLE ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN - VIDEO

  A sexy REDHEADED WOMAN removes her top. She SPINS and

  Cliff moves towards Abbey, stammering.

                That just came over the internet. 
                Video spam... what will they think

  Abbey, not listening, eyes fixed on--

  An unseen man s arm fondles her while she laughs. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                I think it s an ad for a sex pill.

  Cliff moves into the shot and suckles the woman s breast. 

  BACK TO SCENE

  Cliff advances towards Abbey, still trying to be  casual.   
  From the tinny speakers come moans of ecstacy.

  Abbey, disgusted, drops the phone to the floor. 



  Cliff returns, looks around. The stew-- what s left of it-- 
  sizzles from the stove. He grabs the SMOKING pot, burning his 
  hand on the handle. He pivots, dropping it onto a cutting 
  board. 

  His attention is drawn to the message board where only two 
  words remain in dripping black ink:

                        Wake me 


  AT THE SINK

  Cliff scrapes the stew from the bottom of the pot. The 
  gristled meat and burnt gravy spiral into the strainer. 



  Abbey s room is silent except for her labored breathing and 
  the BLIPS and HUM of the machines. 

  The BLIPS slow as her pulse begins to fall and--

  STOPS. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  13.

  The bath is running.

  Cliff removes his watch, placing it on the ledge, the time 
  exactly 11:02 PM. He lowers himself into the water. A pang of 
  discomfort. Cliff adjusts. Sighs. That s better. He closes 
  his eyes. 



  (SOMEONE S) POINT OF VIEW drifts through the darkness. (It) 
  pauses momentarily to admire a collection of FAMILY PHOTOS... 
  before MOVING on. 

  P.O.V approaches the STEREO CABINET. A CD Player lights up. 
  The track skips ahead to  4 . Abbey and Cliff s WEDDING SONG, 
  the same one we heard from the jewelry box.



  Cliff hums along from his semi-conscious state. 

  ANGLE ON: A small pool of water on the tile floor BOILS into 
  steam and disappears. 



  The doctor injects a syringe into Abbey, trying to revive 
  her. He waits for a response then- 

                                DOCTOR
                No good. Defibrillator!

  Laying in the tub. Abruptly, the water level RISES to his 
  chin. Someone-- or thing-- has entered the bath.

  Cliff opens his eyes.



  ABBEY is in the tub across from him, young and perfect, her 
  bare breasts glistening above the water line.


  SUNKEN TUB - FAVORED ANGLES

  Cliff sits up, entranced.

                Abbey. 

  She rises to reveal herself, achingly beautiful, the 
  Honeymoon spoils. She moves towards Cliff and

  Straddles him. 

  Cliff GASPS as-- 

  She reaches between his legs and begins pumping. 

  He tilts his head back, eyes closed. Enraptured.

  Then a CHANGE takes place. Her once flawless skin boils with 
  BLISTERS, turning a crisp umber.

  panting, his eyes in slits, remains unaware. 


  ABBEY S FACE

  turns charcoal black. 


  SUNKEN TUB - FAVORED ANGLES

  Cliff is SWEPT AWAY in the moment, when a BOILED BLOB OF 
  MELTED FLESH lands in his mouth. 

  Cliff gags, opening his eyes to find... the monstrous 
  facsimile of his wife, the ABBEY-THING.

  Cliff fights to remove her, his arms JERKING.  He grabs at 
  her arm.  Her skin sloughs off under his fingers.

  The Abbey-thing overpowers him, a voracious sexual assault.

  Cliff SCREAMS. 




  NEW ANGLE

  From one instant to the next... Cliff finds himself alone, 
  the water gone. And Abbey with it. Did it actually happen? 
  Cliff sits, gasping, spent and frightened like a baby. 



  Abbey s heart is beating again. The Doctor takes the 
    defibrillator pads from her body as the STAFF celebrate their 
    success--cheers, high fives all around.



  Cliff, in the tub, hears a sound, a MELODY, coming from the 
  bedroom. He pulls himself from the tub, grabs a towel, and 
  steps out into--



  Cliff looks to a small shelf outside the bathroom where THE 
  JEWELRY BOX IS OPEN, the tiny couple spinning, playing their 
  song. There s a framed photo next to the jewelry box: CLIFF 
  AND ABBEY S WEDDING PICTURE. SHOT PUSHES IN ON ABBEY S FACE, 
    a pleasant smile, innocent at the time. Tonight... it s taken 
  on a whole new meaning.

  Cliff closes the music box then moves back to...



  Stepping back inside, Cliff catches his reflection in a LARGE 
  MIRROR. He stops and stares because--






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  16.

  CLIFF S P.O.V. - MIRROR

  There are RED MARKS on his back, like handprints, where 
   Abbey s ghost  touched him. 

  Cliff TURNS. In the mirror TWO RED CIRCLES are revealed on 
  his chest, right about where her breasts would have touched 
  him.  

  PUSH INTO CLIFF as, with rising dread, he drops the towel 
  from his waist, staring with horror at his lower regions... 



  Cliff holds the phone to his ear. He s in a nervous panic, 
    periodically examining the red marks in a mirror. 

                                                                INTERCUT WITH:


  IRA S PILLOW & HEADBOARD3131

  A very sleepy IRA lays in bed, trying to talk some sense into 
  Cliff. 

                              IRA
                You fell asleep in the bathtub. You 
                got a boner. You had a sex dream 
                that went bad. 

                              CLIFF
                It wasn t a sex dream. It was 
                  horrible. 

                              IRA
                Sex dreams can be terrifying. I 
                once dreamed I was bangin  this hot 
                little number and all of a sudden 
                she turned into a huge rottweiler  
                with a cock... 

  Ira turns and speaks to an UNSEEN WIFE. 

                              IRA (cont d)
                      (to his wife, tenderly)
                Sorry honey, go back to sleep. 

                              CLIFF
                I ve got red marks where she 
                touched me. Burns. Like sunburn.

                You ve got a rash. You ve been

                She was here.

                Abbey is in a coma. I guarantee 
                you, she hasn t left her room. 

                              CLIFF 
                Maybe not her body. What about her 
                soul?

                              IRA
                I m a lawyer, what do I know about 
                souls?

                You don t understand. When Abbey 
                gets mad, she s relentless. 

                              IRA
                What exactly are we talking about 
                here? Are we talking about a ghost, 
                Cliff? 

                              CLIFF
                      (a slight hesitation)
                Yes. 

                              IRA
                It wasn t a ghost, Cliffy. Why 
                couldn t it be a ghost? Come on. 
                Why?

                              CLIFF
                  Because... Abbey s still alive.

                              IRA
                I was actually looking for  because

  Ira hangs up. 

  The doorbell RINGS. Then again. At this hour? Cliff heads 
  downstairs. 

  Cliff opens the door to reveal: 



  Cliff shuffles towards the whistling kettle and makes himself 
  a cup of tea. A news channel plays its morning show in the 
  living room. A FAMILIAR VOICE cuts through the din of the 
  news. With trepidation, Cliff moves to the--



  On the television, Abbey s mother, Pam, is giving a teary-
  eyed interview in front of the hospital. 

                              PAM
                      (on the television)
                ...he was probably drunk when he 
                crashed that car. He always hated 
                her. He was abusive. At family 
                dinners he would...

                that man take my daughter from me 
                forever. 

  Clifford stands, stunned. Pam does a fantastic job of playing 
  the sensitive, wounded mother.

  AT THE FRONT DOOR-

  Cliff heads out, looking behind him at the empty interior.




  ABBEY, ON A TILT TABLE

  suspended upright, her grisly visage fully unwrapped, 
  matching the thing that visited Cliff last night. 

  A pair of TECHNICIANS scrub and remove (with forceps and 
  scissors) dead tissue from Abbey s extremities. At face 
  value, the debridement process resembles a medieval torture, 
  gory and unrelenting.

  Cliff enters the room, flowers in hand.  Stunned, he studies 
  his wife: exposed cartilage where a nose once was, the 
  sensual lips bloated to clownish proportions. 

  The wretched excess splatters into a basin, MATCHING the 
    concoction in the kitchen sink. 

  He clasps his hand over his mouth, trying not to heave. 

  ABBEY S LEFT EYE opens, staring directly at him. And then... 
  from Abbey s lips, a tortured MOAN, vaguely reminiscent of 
  last night s orgy of horror. 

  Cliff BLINKS, and Abbey s eyes are once again closed. 

  Cliff bolts out of the room, scared witless.

    A stunningly SEXY WOMAN with red hair and a low-cut dress, 
  stands framed in the examination room doorway. It s TRISH, 
  the woman from the cell phone photos. Impulsive, 
    confrontational, selfish, ultra-sexed and self-absorbed, 
  Trish only values what she can t have.

  As Cliff tries to fit the gas-mask over the apparatus in Mr. 
  Schoening s mouth, Trish leans over the chair, her ample 
  breasts over Mr. Schoening s face. She whispers seductively 
  in Cliff s ear. 

                              TRISH
                How long are we going to live this 
                charade? 

  The TELEPHONE rings. Trish, staring intensely at Cliff, makes 
  no move to get it. Finally--

                              CLIFF
                      (irritated)
                I ll get it. 



  Cliff picks up the phone.

                              CLIFF
                Addisson Dental, can I help you? 

                                                                INTERCUT WITH:



  Ira walks into Abbey s room. He sits by the edge of her bed. 
  Abbey lays with her eye open. 

                              IRA
                Well, Abbey. I came to say good-
                bye. Even though you never liked 
                me. 
                      (beat)
                You know, when I heard this awful 
                thing happened to you, the first 
                thing that jumped into my mind was, 
                 I am going to be able to buy a 
                boat.  I m not a nice guy. I admit 
                it. 

  Ira takes a glass hip flask from his inside pocket and 
  unscrews the lid. 

                              IRA (cont d)
                Still, I m sorry this had to happen 
                to you. But like I always say, when 
                life gives you a lemon, you gotta 
                make lemonade. 
                      (then)
                Here s to you Abbey. And lemonade. 

  He drinks. Abbey s pulse begins to quicken and we PUSH INTO 
  ABBEY S EYE, a hidden rage building inside her... 

  A VIDEO MONITOR--



  Cliff, stumbling inside, disoriented and disheveled. Outside 
  the hospital, we can hear protestors CHANTING  Save your 
  soul!  

                                TELEVISION REPORTER
                      (off camera)
                Things have certainly gotten tense, 
                as the crowds have swelled here. 
                  Impromptu demonstrations have 
                broken out both condemning and 
                  supporting Mr. Addisson...



  Cliff meets Ira. 

                              IRA
                Hey, pal. 

                              CLIFF
                      (somber)
                I d like to have some time alone 
                with her. 

                              IRA
                Sure. Meet me in the cafeteria when 
                you re done.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  30.





  Cliff watches the breathing pattern on the monitor, follows 
  the machine to its plug in the wall.  Forlorn, he moves in 
  close to Abbey.  

                              CLIFF
                Abbey. I know I wasn t always the 
                best husband. I don t know if you 
                can find it in your heart to 
                forgive me. I m sorry for that 
                thing with Trish and the fight we 
                had. And for getting you into this 
                  situation. I just want you to 
                know... I ll always love you. 

  He presses his lips against hers. Abbey s eyelid flutters. 
  And then... Cliff feels a sting. He jumps back, a drop of 
  blood hanging his lip. And Abbey s. HE S BEEN BITTEN.

  An ALARM sounds! He turns toward the monitors. ABBEY S VITALS 
  GO COMPLETELY FLAT. 

  Within seconds, a NURSE rushes into the chamber. She presses 
  the intercom. 

                              NURSE
                She s flat-lining again! Code Blue! 
                Page Dr. Loring! 

  The Nurse leads Cliff out as the BURN UNIT TEAM rushes in 
  past them... 

                              NURSE (cont'd)
                This way, Dr. Addisson.


  Cliff stops her. 

                              CLIFF
                Wait... what do you mean she s flat-
                lining again?

  It s eerily silent. Cliff walks up the empty hall, agitated, 
  mind reeling. 

  The fluorescent lights above him begin to FLICKER. 

  Cliff glances at a FOOD CART of leftovers. 

  CLOSE ON: THE TRAY. The left-over pineapple chunks and gravy 
  begins to SIZZLE. 

  MOVING P.O.V. INTO CLIFF, AS HE SPINS AROUND TO SEE--

  ABBEY - YOUNG, SEXY, BEAUTIFUL, INCHES FROM HIS FACE. 

  WIDEN TO REVEAL: Cliff is alone in the hallway. There is no 
  one standing in front of him, but behind him-- 

  The double doors BURST open. 

  Cliff turns around, terrified, as the presence moves away. 

                                                                        CUT TO:



  Ira pauses to take another drink from his glass hip flask. 
  He s starting to sweat. He removes his cell phone and dials. 
  An ORDERLY is passing. 

                              ORDERLY
                Hey guy. No cell phones in the 
                  hospital. 

  When the Orderly is out of sight, Ira, irritated, looks both 
  ways then ducks into the nearest empty room--                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  32.





  Ira enters a small room off the hallway. It s quiet and dark. 
  He doesn t read the sign which reads:  CAUTION EXTREME DANGER-
  - no metal objects in the MRI room, no pace makers, no metal 
  implants, jewelry, coins...  as he moves through to--



    A spacious room with a glass window that views into the 
  control room, where the machines are operated. Ira begins to 
  dial. 

  Suddenly, the phone is HOT in his hand, SMOKING. Ira drops it  
  to the ground, shaking his burning fingers. 

                              IRA
                What the hell?!? 

    Bewildered and annoyed, Ira takes out his handkerchief and 
  folds it in his hand, preparing to pick up his cell phone. 

  Behind him, in the control room window, we see--

  ABBEY, standing pale and ghostly behind the glass. 

  CLOSE ON: The control panel, heat condensation forming inside 
  the gauges, buttons melting. The panel LIGHTS UP as the power 
  goes on. 

  Ira bends down to retrieve his device when--

  There is a SURGING SOUND and--

  Ira s cell phone FLIES across the room and SLAMS into the 
  side of the MRI machine, about six feet above the ground. 

  Ira stands for a bewildered moment, before--

  The magnets catch hold of all the metal on his body and he is 
  flung across the room and VIOLENTLY SLAMMED into the side of 
  the MRI machine, his feet dangling a foot off the ground. 

  Ira s nose is smashed and the glass flask in his pocket is 
  broken. Booze drips down his suit, down his pants leg, and 
  onto the ground. 

  He tries to move, but is held in place by the ring on his 
  finger and the watch on his wrist. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  33.

  He has been pulled with such force that the ring has cut into 
  his finger, drawing blood. 

                              IRA (cont d)
                Ow. 
                      (yelling)
                HELP! HELP! SOMEONE TURN THIS THING 
                OFF! 

  There is no answer. After a moment, Ira sets about to try to 
  free himself. He works the ring off his right hand, tearing 
  the skin from his knuckle then reaches into his jacket pocket 
  and pulls out what s left of the SHATTERED glass flask. It s 
  edges are bloody. Ira drops it to the ground below. He turns 
  his head and SCREAMS. 

  The ABBEY-THING is CRAWLING across the floor. 

  Ira begins to frantically work himself free. 

  Abbey s body gives off tremendous HEAT. She leaves a trail of 
  BLACK hand and foot prints burned into the floor behind her. 
  As she passes light bulbs overhead SHATTER. A hospital gown 
  hanging on the wall begins to SMOKE and BURN--

  The only thing holding him back is his TAG HEUER WATCH. His 
  fingers fumble with the clasp, but it s too tight, tearing at 
  his flesh... 

  Abbey MOVES CLOSER. Ira s face is covered in sweat. The EDGES 
  of his shirt begin to DARKEN and SINGE... 

  Abbey is ALMOST ON HIM, hands reaching out--

  IRA S SHIRT BURSTS INTO FLAME, igniting the soaked in 
  alcohol, just as

  THE WATCH BAND BREAKS. 

  Ira stumbles away, his chest engulfed in flame. He SLAPS at 
  the flames on his chest, FLAILING helplessly... 



  Cliff walks, troubled and forlorn, down the hallway, nursing 
  his bloody lip. Off in the distance, he hears a SCREAM. It 
  sounds like Ira. Cliff takes off RUNNING.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  34.





  There is a SCREAM of  FIRE!  The hall is filling with smoke, 
  coming from the MRI room. Cliff PULLS a FIRE EXTINGUISHER 
  from the wall and runs into--



  Ira is COMPLETELY engulfed in flames. 

  Cliff SPRAYS him with the extinguisher. 

  The ORDERLY and a few HOSPITAL WORKERS are arriving as Cliff 
  puts out the last of the fire to see--

  IRA, burned and blackened, his dead face twisted into an 
  awful SCREAM. 

                              ORDERLY
                Oh man. Oh no. 

  Cliff drops the extinguisher and RUNS out--



  The monitors come ALIVE with sounds and squiggly lines, the 
  Code Team having revived Abbey once again. Dr. Loring offers 
  her congratulations.

                              DR. LORING
                Nice work, people. 
                      (quietly)
                You live another day, Ms. Addisson. 

  Cliff BURSTS inside the room in an urgent, hysterical panic. 

                              CLIFF
                Is she alive? 

                              DR. LORING
                Yes, for now... 

                              CLIFF
                You ve got to save her. Please. I 
                changed my mind... she has to live. 
                      (to Abbey)
                Abbey, honey, sweet-heart, you ve 
                got to live.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  35.





  Dr. Loring and Cliff. She gives him the grim truth. 

                              DR. LORING
                Her wounds are retracting at an 
                  accelerated rate. If a matching 
                donor doesn t present itself 
                within, roughly, twelve hours, 
                surgery will be impossible. 

                              CLIFF
                What, by six a.m. tomorrow? 

                              DR. LORING
                At the latest. 

  ON A MONITOR: 

  Inside the hospital entrance, PAM is giving a tearful 
    interview. Behind her, we can see the signs of PROTESTORS, 
  spilling out into the hallway.

                      (to the cameras)
                I made a terrible mistake! I am 
                  rescinding the DNR. Life is 
                  precious. Abby must stay alive no 
                matter what & if there is a 
                  settlement from Abbey s case I will 
                give it, all of it, to anyone who 
                finds her a donor.  We only have a 
                few hours left.

  Pam, standing behind him, looks strangely unhappy.

  The front door opens, Cliff steps into the quiet, empty room 
  and moves to--



  The patio doors are open and candles have been lit around the 
  pool. Strange. He steps out to--


  THE PATIO - CONTINUOUS

  Light bounces from the pool. Cliff walks slowly, footsteps 
  echoing. He sees something through the glass of the great 
  room, a silhouette -- ABBEY? Slowly, nervously, he steps into-



                              CLIFF
                Abbey?

                bitch?

  Trish looks at a photograph of Abbey on the mantel. Abbey is 
  young, fresh-faced and beautiful.

                God, she was ugly. I ll bet her box

                Fine, whatever. Just stay out of my

                        listening)
                She s laying there coming up with 
                all the things she s going to do to 
                me. Sick, unimaginable things. I 
                mean, I thought she was spiteful 
                when she was alive but now... 

                              TRISH
                Shhh, baby. 

  Trish wraps her arms around him, nuzzles his neck, and rubs 
  her hands on his chest. He looks for a moment like he might 
  succumb, then quickly pushes her hands off and moves away. 

                              CLIFF
                No! This is what started the whole 
                thing. I don t have time. I need... 
                I need a plan. I need... 

                              TRISH
                Mommy knows what you need. 

  Trish begins the sexiest walk in cinematic history towards 
  Cliff, removing her clothes as she goes. 

                              TRISH (cont d)
                You ve been starved physically. 
                Your hormones are in a tizzy. It s 
                addled your brain. 

                              CLIFF
                Stay away from me.

                              TRISH
                Oh baby... I m so hot, I m gushing.  
                I can t stand it. Be merciful. I m 
                going to let you do whatever you 
                want. I can t stop you. I m 
                helpless to your barbaric sexual

  Trish is naked by the time she stops walking, squared up to 
  him, about three feet away. Cliff looks at her, torn between 
  his fear and his hunger. 

                              TRISH (cont d)
                      (a whisper)

                Trish, you re fired. Get your shit 
                and get out. 

  She stands in exactly the same position. Unmoving. A 
  standoff. Then he--

  LUNGES FOR HER. His lips meet hers in a desperate, sloppy, 
  starved kiss, gasping with desire, their hands all over each 
  other... 

  ANGLE FROM OVERHEAD suggesting a HOVERING P.O.V, as the two 
  of them fall to the floor, consumed with passion, and begin 
  to make love. 

  Camera MOVES DOWN, to eye level, finding the PICTURE of Abbey 
  on the mantel-- Cliff and Trish in the reflection. 



  Cliff and Trish lay together, post coital. Cliff is looking 
  over at the clock, nervously. It reads two a.m. 

                              TRISH 
                Why are you staring at the clock? 

                              CLIFF
                I can t help it. 

                              TRISH
                You know you re being crazy, right? 

                              CLIFF

  She kisses him on the lips, sweetly & gets out of bed, still 
  naked, and grabs his shirt.

                              CLIFF
                Where are you going? 

                              TRISH
                To get another bottle of wine, if 
                that s O.K. 

  Cliff s gaze falls to: the bathroom. He slips into a 
    flashback. 



  Cliff stands outside the bathroom door. 

                              CLIFF 
                Abbey? 
                      (Knocks again, growing 
                        concerned)
                Please answer me. 

  Still no answer. 

                                                                INTERCUT WITH:



  Abbey stands on the other side of the door, tears on her 
  cheeks. He speaks gently. 

                              CLIFF
                Please open the door. 
                      (then)
                  I cleared the weekend. I thought we 
                might take a drive to the cabin. 

  Abbey is looking down at something in her hand. CLOSE ON THE 
  ITEM: It is a HOME PREGNANCY TEST WAND.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  41.

                      (softly)
                Like old times, huh? 

  ON CLIFF: 

                              CLIFF
                What? What did you say? 

  A moment later the door opens. Abbey stands framed in the 
  doorway. 

                              ABBEY
                O.K. Let s take a drive. 

  On Cliff s face, a ray of hope. 

  END FLASHBACK. 

  Behind Cliff, who s still waiting for a response, a 
    photograph of Abbey falls from the dresser--

  --CRASH. 

  Cliff is JARRED out of his trance. The wind? Cliff gets off 
  the bed and shuts the window. He looks down at the picture on 
  the ground, the glass cracked over Abbey s face. 



  Trish enters and starts looking through the wine rack. 

                                                                        CUT TO:

  glides along the upstairs hall, finds Trish, beginning to 
  sweat as she goes looking for a cork-screw and some glasses. 



  Cliff backs away from the window, nervous, sensing another 
  presence. A moment of SILENCE. His cell rings. He spins 
  around. 

  The phone is on the night stand. Waiting. Cliff picks up.

                              CLIFF
                Hello?

  A picture materializes. Cliff looks down at the receiver. 


  CELL PHONE SCREEN - FIRST SHOT

  A self portrait of Trish, initiating a striptease from the 
  kitchen, one arm covering her breasts.


  SECOND SHOT

  Trish flashes her left breast.


  ON CLIFF 

  He finds it really kind of sweet... until he notices 
  something else in the frame. His smile disappears. 


  BACK TO - CELL PHONE - SECOND SHOT

  Another FIGURE, the Abbey-thing, creeps up behind Trish.


  THIRD SHOT

  Trish flashes her right breast, the Abbey-thing closer.

  Trish flashes both breasts, the Abbey-thing there by her

  FIFTH SHOT

  A blank FRAME... accompanied by TRISH S (off screen) SCREAM!

  CLIFF RUNS. 



  Cliff, RUNS into the kitchen. He sees something that stops 
  him in his tracks--

  THE MESSAGE BOARD. A new note, written in ASH, reads:

                       skin 

  Trish COWERS against the wall, WHIMPERING. 

  Cliff helps her up. She clings to him tightly, shivering like 
  a child, paralyzed with fear. 

                              TRISH
                Is she... still here? 

                              CLIFF
                I don t thinks so. They must have 
                revived her again. 

                              TRISH
                Oh God. It was awful. That burning 
                smell...  Please... protect me. 

  He begins to lead her out. 

                              TRISH (cont'd)
                You can t let her die. You can t. 
                She s got to live. No matter what. 
                You ve got to stop her. 

  Cliff, moving behind her, PICKS UP an empty wine bottle.  

                              CLIFF 
                      (almost sadly)
                I know. 

  He raises the wine bottle over his head, and...                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  44.





  Cliff opens the cabinet below the sink. Removes a COOLER, 
  emptying its contents on the floor: sponges, rolls of tin 
  foil, Mr. Clean. He rushes to the freezer and starts to fill 
  the cooler with ice. 

  He glances up at the large clock over the sink: it s just 
  after 3 a.m. 



  A pair of HANDS, shaking slightly, slip into rubber gloves.

  Steel ORAL SURGICAL TOOLS are laid out on a tray. 

  The hands release a valve attached to a canister of nitrous 
  oxide. Gas hisses through a tube. 

  CLOSE ON TRISH - A mask hooded over her mouth and nose, her 
  eyes in slits, a wound to her temple crudely tended to. 
  Feeling the first affects of the gas... Trish smiles.

  ON CLIFF, sweaty and desperate, ready for surgery. The time 
  has come. 



  Close on: the STEREO. It flicks to life, playing a MUZAK 
  version of Cliff and Abbey s WEDDING SONG. 

  CLIFF looks out into the waiting room, hearing the familiar 
  ballad. 

                              CLIFF
                Just a few hours, Abbey. Just hang 
                on. 

  Cliff picks up a nasty looking dental instrument as a 
  makeshift dermatome. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                I m sorry you have to be alive for 
                this Trish... your skin has to be 
                fresh. 

  TRISH, tied and bound to the dental chair resembling Abbey s 
  debridement session. Broken lines have been drawn in blue 
  ink, sectioning off Trish s skin like a human jigsaw puzzle. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  45.

  A steel basin lies under her head for overflow.  An extension 
  cord keeps her hands to her sides at crotch level.

                Now you are going to feel a little 
                  pressure... 

  CLIFF scores a path along the broken lines with the make-
  shift dermatome.

  TRISH SCREAMS! Takes in a whiff of gas. Laughs! SLICE. She 
  screams. Cliff increases the gas. Trish is disoriented and 
  loopy. 

                              TRISH
                Do I... have a cavity?

                Yes. It will be over soon. 

  She laughs as he cuts her again.

  The surgery almost complete... a mound of skin lays in the 
  cooler beside them, gory flaps draping over the side. 

  Cliff looks down at his watch. Wipes away the blood to see 
  that it s almost five a.m. 

  Trish looks like a page out of Gray s Anatomy, every blood-
  soaked muscle exposed.  Cliff continues to work, his scrubs 
  covered in Rorschach blotches of red.

  As for Trish... she s no longer screaming. By now, 
    everything s just too hilarious. 

  Cliff drops the skin into the cooler. His job complete, he 
  picks up an ELECTRIC CARVING KNIFE and REVS the blades.  He 
  kneels down to look into TRISH S GLASSY EYES.

                              CLIFF
                You ve very brave, Trish. I m 
                afraid this last part... doesn t 
                get any better. 

  Cliff starts the saw and brings it down towards her skinless 
  body...                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  46.

  Cliff listens to a TALK RADIO SHOW as he drives. It features 
  a MALE and a FEMALE HOST, bantering back and forth, laughing, 
  flirting, a  Frosty, Heidi & Frank  kind of deal. Cliff 
  glances at the clock on the radio: 5:25. 

                              MALE HOST (RADIO V.O.)
                I mean, we all want to control our 
                mates, but come on. First she s off 
                the ventilator, then she s on. Next 
                week she ll be off again. There s 
                gotta be a limit!

                                FEMALE HOST (RADIO V.O.)
                I ll tell you one thing. If my 
                dentist looked like Dr. Cliff, he 
                could drill me day and night, 
                honey. 

                              MALE HOST (RADIO V.O.)
                So you re publicly admitting you 
                have a thing for Dr. Cliff? Maybe 
                we should open up the phone lines 
                for this...

  Cliff shuts off the radio, miserable, and thinks back to... 
  that night.

  Cliff runs in holding the cooler. A thin trickle of watery 
  ice and blood leaks out onto the floor. A NURSE recognizes 
  Cliff, who is looking desperate and disheveled.

                Cliff, Abbey died last night. I

                I m sorry. You might want to talk 
                to a grief counselor... 

  Cliff turns and walks back the way he came.

                Mr. Addisson? Before you go there s
