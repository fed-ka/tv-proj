    Conflict around the family dinner table.  Ian is locked in an 
    argument with his parents, father MICHAEL and mother LYDIA, 
    both in their late thirties.

                                IAN
                  Dad, Dex is the worst bully in 
                  school.  Everyone knows it.                                                                                   3.



                                LYDIA
                  That doesn t mean you and that 
                  temper of yours have to charge in 
                    swinging...again.

                                IAN
                  So I m supposed to watch him push 
                  around other kids and do nothing.  

    Michael tries to reason with his son.  One gets the idea 
    they ve had arguments like this before - a lot.

                                MICHAEL
                  You tell a teacher, or you tell us.  
                  You don t unload on a boy who can t 
                  defend himself.

                                IAN 
                  Dex is tough enough.

                                MICHAEL
                  Not against you.  Remember Johnny 
                  Alcott? 

                                IAN
                  I didn t mean to break his arm.  It 
                  was a tournament.

  Ian is stung as an old wound is reopened.  Lydia cautions 
    Michael.

                                LYDIA
                  That wasn t Ian s fault, Michael.

                                MICHAEL
                  No, it was ours for allowing him to 
                  take karate.  

                                IAN
                  I quit competition and paid 
                  Johnny s hospital bill out of my 
                  college fund.  What more could I 
                  do??


                                MICHAEL
                  You could think before lashing out.  
                  You know the saying,  discretion is 
                  the better part of valor. 

                                IAN
                  Meaning it s okay to turn tail and 
                  run.                                                                                  4.



                                MICHAEL
                  Meaning there s almost always 
                  another option to fighting. 

                                IAN
                  Really?   Cause it seems that s all 
                  we do around here.

  Ian bolts from the table and storms out of the kitchen.



    Basic teen boy s room, sport hero and video game posters on 
  the walls.  Ian sits at his desk and plays an on-line role-
    playing fight game like World of Warcraft called HORDE 
    RAIDERS.  He deftly dispatches one attacker after another.  
    It s as if Ian can sense each movement of the character 
    before they make it.  Ian hears voices of other players over 
  his headset.  We see the names of several players on the 
    screen:  Orcslayer (Ian s name) Shadow Knight, Dawn Magus and 
    Echo119

                                HEADSET VOICE #1
                        (male, young)
                  Hey, Slayer.  Leave some for the 
                  rest of us.

                                IAN
                        (into headset)
                  Keep up, Shadow Knight.

                                HEADSET VOICE #2
                        (female, young)
                  I have a freezing spell that 
                  will...

                                IAN
                  Miles ahead of you, Magus.

    A flick of his wrist and Ian has dispatched the remaining 
    ogres on the screen.

                                HEADSET  VOICE #3
                  You re very skilled, Slayer.

                                IAN
                  Thanks...
                        (checks screen name)
                  Echo119.

                                HEADSET VOICE #2
                  Yeah.  He never lets us play.                                                                                  5.



                                IAN
                  Maybe tomorrow, Magus.

                                HEADSET VOICE #2
                  I ll believe it when I see it.  
                  C mon, Shadow Knight.  Let s count 
                  our treasure.

                                IAN
                  Haven t seen you in the game 
                  before, Echo.  

                                ECHO 
                  No one sees an echo, Ian.

                                IAN
                  How do you know my name?  Do you go 
                  to my school?

                                ECHO
                        (evading the question)
                  You re a terrific player.  I m 
                  looking forward to our next 
                  encounter.   

                                IAN
                  Whenever.  I m here every night.

                                ECHO 
                  Are you sad about that?

                                IAN
                  Being stuck in jerkwater suburbia?  
                  My only physical outlet on-line 
                  fantasy games?  What gave you that 
                  idea?

                                ECHO 
                  Things change.

                                IAN
                  Not soon enough for me.

    Echo s name vanishes from Ian s screen.

  Ian starts to play the game again.  He cranks the volume.  
    From off-screen comes the voice of his dad:

                                MICHAEL (O.S.)
                  You want to turn that down?  

                                IAN
                  Not really.                                                                                  6.



                                MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    Ian...headphones, please?

  Ian plugs in his headset and resumes playing.  Beneath the 
    sounds of battle, a strange electronic BUZZING SOUND is 
    building.  Ian tries to turn down the volume but the buzzing 
    sound gets louder.  It seems to have a calming effect on Ian.  
  His eyelids flutter and he falls asleep.



    Asleep in a strange bed.  In the distance a BELL RINGS.  

                                DON (OFF)
                  Hey.  First bell.

  Ian stirs, waking up.

                                ZACK (OFF)
                  Better motivate.  

    Ian s eyes open.


    IAN S POV - ROOMMATES

    Looking down at Ian are three big guys his age or a couple 
    years older.  They are DON, RAY and ZACK.  They are well-
    dressed in identical school uniforms -- ties, jackets, big 
    toothy smiles.  Unnerving.

                                ZACK 
                  You ll miss breakfast.

                                DON
                  And that would suck.

                                RAY
                  Dining hall s closed until lunch.


  IAN 

    Bolts from the bed, shocked at the sight of these strangers.

                                IAN
                  How d you get in my room?

  The guys react with good-natured disbelief.  Who is this 
    screwy kid?                                                                                  7.



                                RAY
                  Your room?  Try our room, noob.

  Ian looks around and for the first time it sinks in that he 
  is not in his own home.  He leaps to the window and looks 
    out.


    IAN S POV - SCHOOL GROUNDS

  We see the well-manicured grounds and stately dormitories of 
    what appears to be an exclusive private school.  

  Ian turns away from the window, his mind spinning.  

                                IAN
                  Where am I?

                                END PROLOGUE                                                                                  8.




                                PREP

                                NEW KID

                                ACT ONE



  Ian is still desperately looking for answers about his new 
    surroundings.  Zack, Don and Ray react in a very matter of 
    fact way to Ian s questions.  They give him lots of 
    information, but nothing he can really understand.

                                IAN
                  This place...

                                ZACK 
                  I know.  Tower Prep School.  
                  Awesome, huh? 

                                RAY
                  Many apply.  Only the lucky few 
                  make it.

                                DON
                  Tower s got a great academic 
                  program.  Challenging, intense.  

    Zack is fiddling with a strange-looking piece of equipment, 
    something like a lacrosse stick. 

                                ZACK
                  Our Buffer team s undefeated.  You 
                  play? 

                                IAN
                  What?  No...who are you?

                                DON
                  I m Don.  That s Ray and the big 
                  guy is Zack.  First bell rang.  You 
                  don t have much time, Ian.

                                IAN
                  How do you know my name?

  Ray points to a closet door.  Ian s name is on it.

                                RAY
                  Nice to have a new roommate.                                                                                    9.



                                RAY
                  We ve been a man short since 
                  Phillips did the forest run.  Or 
                  tried to.

  Ian looks where Ray is pointing.  He sees one of four closets 
  set into the dorm room wall, one of which bears his name.  To 
  say Ian is having a hard time taking this in is an 
    understatement.

                                IAN
                  But my mom and dad never...

  Ian turns back to question his roommates.

                                IAN
                  Who brought me here?

  The three guys share mystified shrugs.

                                DON
                  Don t know.  We came back from 
                  study hall last night and there you 
                  were, fast asleep.

                                ZACK
                  About that -- you might want to ask 
                  Doctor to fit you for a snore 
                  guard.  Kinda loud.

  Ian is reeling, he can t fathom any of this.  

                                IAN
                  Doesn t make sense. 

                                DON
                  Nothing does, until you ve been to 
                  orientation.  

                                IAN
                  What s that?

  Don hands Ian some notes jotted down on a slip of paper.

                                DON
                  Figured you d be lost the first 
                  day.  Just follow this.  

                                IAN
                  Okay, but what...

    Another BELL SOUNDS.                                                                                  10.



                                ZACK
                  Last bell.  Going to be late.

                                IAN
                  Late for what?  

    Don, Ray and Zack shoulder their backpacks and head out the 
    door.

                                DON
                  See you at Orientation.  We ll save 
                  you a place.

  The three boys exit, leaving the confused Ian alone in the 
    room.  

  Ian steps to his closet, opens it.  Inside are several 
    uniforms identical to his roommates.  Ian pushes them aside 
  and finds a few of his things on a shelf, including his iPod 
  and cell phone.  He quickly dials his home number.  He hears 
  the line pick up.

                                IAN
                  Mom?!  It s Ian!  Hello?

                                ECHO (V.O.)
                  I m sorry, Ian.  You are out of 
                  carrier range.  

  Ian recognizes the voice from the night before.

                                IAN
                  Wait...Echo?

                                ECHO (V.O.)
                  Have a nice day.

  The voice clicks off.  Ian pushes more buttons, tries to get 
    a dial tone.

                                IAN
                  Hello?  Hello!

  But the phone is dead.  Ian tosses the phone back in the 
    closet.  He takes a shirt and pants from the hangers and 
    quickly starts to throw them on.



  Ian enters the building.  Fairly sterile, not much there.  
  Ian notes a sign on the wall: RECEPTIONIST.  He rounds a 
    corner to find an open window, the kind that would house a 
    receptionist in a doctor s or lawyer s office.  He looks in 
  the window.

                                IAN
                  I m looking for Echo?

  But the receptionist booth is empty.  That is, there is no 
    human receptionist there.  There is however, a sophisticated 
    computer installed in the booth.  Above it are monitors that 
    show most of the school.  This appears to be a security 
    system that keeps watch over the students at all times.  On 
  the side of the computer console in raised letters is the 
    computer s name - ECHO 119.  

                                ECHO (V.O.)
                  All new students, Orientation 
                  begins in thirteen minutes.  Don t 
                  be late.  

  Ian reels away from the window, confusion giving way to fear.  
  He hurries toward another door leading out of the reception 
    building.



  Not much of this office is revealed now.  A silhouetted 
    figure, THE HEADMASTER, watches Ian on a security monitor.  
  On screen the boy exits Reception and heads down what looks 
  to be the main road into the school.  Headmaster s gaze is 
    impassive, hard to read.



  Ian goes down a dark hallway.  A strange muted ROARING SOUND 
  is heard rising in the distance.  The only door in the 
    hallway appears before Ian.  He checks his notes again and 
    pushes through the doors.



    Instantly Ian is assaulted by a blast of bright STROBE LIGHTS 
  and PULSING SOUNDS.  

                                LEADER (O.S.)
                  Move!

    A HELMETED FIGURE streaks in on skates, crashes into Ian and 
    sends him flying.

    Then, MORE FIGURES crash into him from all sides.  The 
    figures wear padded suits, in line skates and carry swing 
    hook-like clubs.  Several of the figures swing their clubs at 
    him.  

  Ian rolls away and comes up fighting.  He decks several of 
  the figures, flips and kicks a few more.  

  The most imposing of the figures, clearly the leader, 
    launches himself at Ian.  This guy can really fight.  Ian 
    quickly finds himself on the defensive.  More helmeted 
    figures run to back up their leader.  They swarm over Ian and 
    take him down -- hard.

                                                                        FADE OUT 

                                END ACT ONE                                                                                  14.





                                PREP

                                 NEW KID 

                                ACT TWO



  On Ian, on the floor and looking for a way to fight the 
    strange figures that attacking him.  His hand grabs a fallen 
    buffer stick.  He swings it, knocking a few of the attackers 
    away.

  The leader of the figures slaps the stick out of Ian s hand.

                                LEADER
                  Drop it!

  The leader takes off his helmet.  He is Ian s age, African-
    American, bald, and at the moment, angry.  This is CAL RICE, 
  the captain of the buffer team.

                                CAL
                  You better have a real good reason 
                  for attacking my team!

                                IAN
                  They jumped me!

  Ian takes a swing at Cal.  Remarkably, Cal ducks it.  Just 
    then the team COACH runs up.  Late thirties, early forties.  
    BIG. You don t screw with this guy.

                                COACH
                  Hey!  That s all, Rice.

                                CAL
                  Okay, Coach.

  Cal turns, deliberately hooking Ian with his buffer stick, 
    tripping him.  Ian hits the floor to the amusement of the 
    team.

    Coach pulls Ian up.

                                COACH
                  Got a name, tough guy?                                                                                  15.



                                IAN
                  Ian Traynor.

    Coach nods, understanding.

                                COACH
                  Figures.  Every year some clueless 
                  noob gets sent down here to have 
                  his butt kicked by the Buffer team.  
                      (to Ian)
                  You re being hazed, Traynor.

  The other players, including Cal, LAUGH at Ian.

                                COACH
                  You want Orientation.  The building 
                  by the flag pole.  

                                IAN
                  Thanks.  One more thing...

  All traces of the cocky hothead are gone now.  Ian is just a 
    scared kid in need of answers.

                                IAN
                  What is this place?

    Coach studies Ian for a second, possibly pitying him.  But 
  all he says is:

                                COACH
                  Orientation.  Building by the flag 
                  pole.  

    Coach turns back to the players.

                                COACH
                  Break s over.  Take your sides.

  Cal returns to his teammates.  Ian heads out the arena door, 
    more confused than ever.



  Ian enters the darkened hall.  Inside he sees perhaps a dozen 
    uniformed STUDENTS sitting at small cubicles.  The students 
    watch different images of school life as they listen to a 
    muted speech over ear buds.  Each student seems to be 
    listening to something different.  This was the last thing 
  the surprised Ian expected. He doesn t know what to think.

                                DON (OFF)
                  He s in there.  

  An older student, a MONITOR by her different uniform, hurries 
    over.  She s taller than Ian, and tough.

                                MONITOR
                  What s the problem?

                                IAN
                  I was going to Orientation, but...                                                                                  17.



                                MONITOR
                  Orientation s closed.  Headmaster 
                  heard you ve been making trouble.  
                  He wants to see you.

  The monitor roughly pulls Ian outside, causing him to bump 
    into some passing students.  One of them is a girl, fifteen, 
    very pretty.  

                                IAN
                  Sorry.

  And suddenly C.J. turns back to her friends, contemptuously 
    dismissing Ian.

                                C.J.
                  I can t stand kids who won t get 
                  with the Program.

                                IAN
                  Hey, I don t even want to be here.

                                MONITOR
                  Headmaster.  Now.  

  Ian is pulled away by the Monitor.  Don, Ray and Zack 
    exchange grins as they head out.



  The most arresting feature of this book-lined office is the 
    large 3D relief MAP of the school laid out like a train 
    diorama on a table.  It shows the school from all angles, as 
    well as the surrounding woods, but nothing beyond that.  

  Ian sits uncomfortably in front of THE HEADMASTER, a pleasant-
    looking man anywhere between his late thirties and early 
    fifties.  Headmaster reads from a file.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Ian Traynor.  Fifteen.  Attributes, 
                  intelligence, loyalty, courage.  
                  Flaws, stubbornness and a quick 
                  temper.  Psychological profile 
                  reveals a sensitive core -- still 
                  misses the dog he lost three years 
                  ago.  

                                IAN
                  Where did you get that?                                                                                  18.



                                  HEADMASTER
                        (continuing reading)
                  Excels at all sports particularly 
                  those requiring team strategy.  
                      (to Ian)
                  I think you might enjoy our Buffer 
                  team.

                                IAN
                  I met the captain.  No.  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Too bad.
                        (continues reading)
                  Despite excellent leadership 
                  potential, subject prefers to go 
                  his own way. 

  The Headmaster puts the file down, smiles at Ian.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  You re an interesting young man, 
                  Ian.  I hope we ll be friends.

  Ian regards him skeptically.

                                IAN
                  Am I under arrest?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Of course not.

                                IAN
                  In some kind of reform school?  
                  Juvenile hall?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  No.  

                                IAN
                  Then what is this place?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  The important question is, who are 
                  you?

                                IAN
                  Excuse me?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Ian, how long would you have lasted 
                  at your old school?  You were 
                  already suspended.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  19.

                                  HEADMASTER (cont'd)
                  One more incident and you d have 
                  been expelled.  Then what?  Off to 
                  another school and another 
                  incident?  A boy like you was not 
                  meant to drift through a system 
                  geared for ordinary minds with 
                  ordinary ambitions.  

                                IAN
                  I m no one special.

                                HEADMASTER
                  I don t think you believe that.  
                  Why did you take on that bully the 
                  other day?

                                IAN
                  He went after my friend.

                                HEADMASTER
                  Real reason?

  Ian doesn t answer, but he seems to be holding back.  
    Headmaster fills in the blank.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  He was a challenge.  As much as you 
                  wanted to help your friend, I think 
                  you wanted to test yourself even 
                  more. 

    Headmaster points to the relief map.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Tower Prep was created expressly 
                  for students like you.  Young 
                  people who believed they are out of 
                  step with the rest of the world, 
                  when in reality everyone else is 
                  lagging behind.

  Ian looks at the map, trying to find a familiar landmark.

                                IAN
                  And Tower Prep is where, exactly?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Where you are geographically is not 
                  as important as where you are 
                  mentally.  As a student here you ll 
                  follow an intensive program to 
                  master what we call your unique 
                  potential.                                                                                   20.



                                IAN
                  I don t believe any of this.  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  The program is challenging, but I 
                  think it s the kind of test you ve 
                  been looking for.  Certainly more 
                  satisfying than getting top score 
                  at Horde Raiders.

    Ian s gaze falls on the nameplate on the Headmaster s desk.  
  It reads simply HEADMASTER, nothing else.

                                IAN
                  Headmaster, is that it?  No other 
                  name?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Staff members are addressed by 
                  their titles; Math, Science, I know 
                  you already met Coach.  Keeps 
                  everything simple yet respectful.  
                  Any other questions?

                                IAN
                  One big one...

    Headmaster makes an astute guess.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Yes.  Your parents know where you 
                  are.

  Ian shakes his head in disbelief.

                                IAN
                  They couldn t have been happy about 
                  this.

    Headmaster levies the final words he ll say on the subject.  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  I didn t say they were happy, I 
                  said they know where you are.

  An emotional punch in the gut for Ian.  He has no comeback 
  for this.                                                                                  21.





  Ian enters a large circular CLASSROOM.  It resembles a 
    futuristic version of a modern college lecture hall.  

  The teacher, known only as SCIENCE, white, late forties, 
    rattles off biology facts a mile a minute.  Pictures of small 
    carnivores flash on a screen around Science as he talks.  All 
  the students in the hall are imputing data to their laptops 
  as fast as Science can spew them out.  

  As Science drones on, Ian looks for an unobtrusive place 
  where he can sit unnoticed.  There is none.  

                                SCIENCE 
                  ...Of which D. Maculatus is only 
                  one example.  Owing to convergent 
                  evolution, many members of the 
                  family Dasuridae share 
                  characteristics with their 
                  placental counterparts, including 
                  the Procyonidae, the Mustelidae...  

    Science abruptly breaks off and addresses Ian.  All the 
    students turn to stare at him.

                                SCIENCE 
                  You re late, Mr. Traynor.  Please 
                  take your seat.  

  Ian sees that his seat is in the dead-center of the 
    classroom.  Even more unsettling, his name is on his desk.  
    Cheeks burning, Ian edges down the aisle to his seat, 
    painfully aware every pair of eyes is on him.                                                                                  24.



    A thin, geeky kid, GABRIEL FLORES, makes a comment as Ian 
  edges by.  

                                GABE
                  And the one thought going through 
                  his head right now,  God, I hope I 
                  don t fart.  

  The other kids erupt with laughter.  Ian shoots Gabe a 
    murderous look.  Gabe shrugs and smiles.  Class clown, 
    whatcha gonna do?

    Science glares coldly at Gabe.  

                                SCIENCE
                  Disruptive and inappropriate as 
                  always, Mr. Flores.  Since zoology 
                  bores you, please engage us with 
                  your analysis of muon-catalyzed 
                  fusion.  

  Gabe starts to give a slow, rambling answer, all the while 
    playing for time.

                                GABE
                        (stalling)
                  Yes...those would be the positively 
                  charged deuterons and tritons that 
                  fuse with what is known in physics 
                  circles as the negatively charged 
                  munons, which as we all know, 
                  create...

  The BELL RINGS, signalling the end of the class.

                                SCIENCE 
                  Too bad, Mr. Flores.  There s the 
                  bell. 

                                GABE
                        (mouths quietly)
                  Yes!

    Then Science adds:

                                SCIENCE
                  That gives you extra time to study 
                  before finishing your answer 
                  tomorrow.

                                GABE
                        (downcast)
                  Ugh...                                                                                  25.



    Science gathers his things to go. Ian stands to exit, but all 
  the other students sit where they are.  Science exits, 
    passing another teacher coming in. The name card on the desk 
    automatically switches to the name MATH.  Math looks up to 
  see Ian standing up by himself, confused.

                                MATH
                  Sit down, Mr. Traynor.  I won t 
                  keep you too long.

    More laughter from the students.  

                                MATH
                  Now then, fractals.

  Ian sits as Math launches into a long discourse on fractals, 
  the numbers flashing quickly on the screen behind him.  

  Ian looks down to see a small folded piece of paper on his 
    desk.  It wasn t there a moment before.  Ian opens the note 
  and reads it.


    CLOSE ON NOTE 

  One revealing sentence, hastily scribbled.  It reads:  I M 
    SCARED, TOO.


  ON IAN 

    Glancing around to find the sender of the note.  He looks 
    from face to face, but each of the students has their head 
    down as they intently type into their computers.  

  Ian slips the paper into his pocket.  He tries, with little 
    success, to focus on the lecture. 



  Ian enters after his first day of class.  He is not happy to 
    find his roommates sprawled on his bed playing cards.  Even 
    worse, they are playing for the few personal items taken from 
    Ian s closet.

                                IAN
                  Oh, hell no.

  The bullies again play it sort of friendly.

                                ZACK
                  Ian.  How was your first day?                                                                                   26.



  Ian barely contains his anger.  He wants to pummel the three 
    smirking assholes.

                                IAN
                  Well, Zack.  It really kinda 
                  sucked.

                                DON
                  Always does.

                                RAY
                  Never gets better, either.

                                DON
                  Not when you live with us.

                                ZACK
                  Might want to call mommy and daddy 
                  and have them pick you up.
                        (smirks)
                  Oh, right.  Can t.

  Don puts down a winning hand.

                                DON
                  I ll take the iPod.

                                IAN
                  Hey!

  Ian moves to grab the iPod, but Ray tosses it to Don.  Don 
    misses it on purpose and the iPod hits the wall and breaks.

                                RAY
                  Piece of crap anyway.

  And that s it.  Before Ray can move, Ian has him off the bed, 
    face down on the floor.  Instantly Zack and Don are on their 
    feet, facing off against Ian.  There is something almost 
    militaristic about they way they have positioned themselves.  

                                DON
                        (serious threat)
                  You re sure?

                                ZACK
                        (even more serious)
                  Please be sure.

    After a tense moment, Ian realizes now s not the time.                                                                                  27.



                                IAN
                  Take it.  It s yours.  All of it.  
                  I ve had it with you, with that 
                  psycho in the castle, with this 
                  whole damn nut house.  I m out.

  Ian exits, fed up.  Grins all around from the bullies.



  Ian traces his steps, trying to find his way out of the 
    forest.  In the distance he see tiny bobbing RED LIGHTS, the 
  eyes of the Gnomes as they search in a clearing.  

  Ian turns and moves quickly down another path.  He is careful 
  to not make a sound as he hurries away from the direction 
    taken by the Gnomes.  Just then he reacts to the sound of 
    hushed voices coming down the trail.

                                C.J. (O.S.)
                        (whispered)
                  Which way?

  Ian leaps off the trail and hides behind a tree.  He peeks 
  out to see THREE KIDS coming his way.  They are C.J., the 
    pretty girl who sneered at him in the orientation line, Gabe 
    Flores, the class clown, and a Japanese girl, a stranger to 
  Ian.  We will learn her name is SUKI. She consults a small 
    hand-held electronic device, like an iPhone.  On it is a 
    digital map of the forest.  Suki has to hold her hand over 
  the device to keep it from giving off too much light.

                                SUKI
                  Down here, I think.  

  C.J. Whispers to Gabe, who has fallen behind.  

                                C.J.
                  Keep up, Flores!

  Gabe hurries to join them.  He is breathing hard.                                                                                  30.



                                GABE
                  I wasn t made for this.  Wise-
                  cracking my way out of a fight, I 
                  can do that.  Scaling walls to 
                  freedom, not so much.

                                SUKI
                  Shh!  They ll hear us! 

                                GABE
                  If they re even out there.

    Suddenly C.J. hears something.

                                C.J.
                  Wait!  We re not alone! 

  Ian jumps out of hiding.  The other three nearly freak, but 
  Ian gestures for them to be quiet.

                                IAN
                  Shh!

  He gestures for them to follow him.  After a moment of 
    hesitation, the other three follow him.



  Ian has convinced the others.  They are all trekking back 
    through the dark woods toward the school, Suki in the lead, 
    consulting her map.  

                                IAN
                  ...I m talking on line to that Echo 
                  voice, then I heard this buzzing on 
                  my headphones, then I woke up here.  

    C.J. has heard variations on this story.

                                C.J.
                  A girl in my dorm said she heard 
                  Echo s voice on her cell phone 
                  before she passed out.  Same deal.

    Gabe chimes in with his story.

                                GABE
                  I was listening to my music pod 
                  when I passed out.  Next morning I 
                  was in uniform, listening to a 
                  lecture on Pre-Columbian history in 
                  German.  And the weird thing was, 
                  by the end of class, I was actually 
                  starting to understand it.                                                                                  34.



  Ian looks curiously to Suki.  

                                SUKI
                  My parents had a big fight before I 
                  came.  I never knew what it was 
                  about.  I just turned on our big 
                  screen TV and tried to drown out 
                  their screaming.  Then I heard the 
                  buzzing.

  Ian takes the iPhone-like device from her.  On the phone is a 
    brand name - SATO.  Ian makes the connection.

                                IAN
                  Suki Sato, as in Sato Electronics?

    A source of embarrassment for Suki.

                                SUKI
                  Yeah, kind of.

    C.J. fills Ian in on her history.

                                C.J.
                  I don t have any memories of my 
                  life before TowerSchool.  As far as 
                  I know, I ve always been here.  

                                IAN
                  If this is your home, why were you 
                  trying to escape? 

                                C.J.
                  Maybe I ll start to remember the 
                  life I had before school.  There s 
                  got to be more than just TowerPrep 
                  and The Program.  

                                IAN
                  And yet you dumped on me for not 
                  following it.  

                                C.J.
                  We had the break planned for a long 
                  time.  I didn t want anyone to 
                  suspect.

                                IAN
                  Escapes, masked goons, my old 
                  school was never like this.                                                                                  35.



                                GABE
                  That s because most of us at our 
                  little day care center are what 
                  you d call,  special.   Not short 
                  bus special, but  I can do some 
                  weird thing really well  special.  

                                IAN
                  Not that I m buying into this, but 
                  can you give me a for instance?  

                                GABE
                  Suki?

    Suki pauses and says in a perfect imitation of Ian s voice:

                                SUKI
                      (in Ian s voice)
                  Not that I m buying into this, but 
                  can you give me a for instance?  

  Ian is impressed, and sort of scared.

                                IAN
                  Okay, that s weird.

                                SUKI
                      (as C.J.)
                  I can do that with anyone I ve ever 
                  heard, even once...
                      (as Gabe)
                  And with the right clothes and 
                  moves, I can pass myself off as the 
                  real thing, until I drop the 
                  disguise...
                      (as herself)
                  ...and become me again.  Whoever 
                  that is.  

                                IAN
                  And you?

                                C.J.
                  You know the expression,  I can 
                  read you like a book ?  Everyone 
                  communicates through facial tics, 
                  quick breaths, nervous eyelash 
                  flickers. It s like a second 
                  language to me.

                                IAN
                  Seriously?                                                                                  36.



                                C.J.
                  From the second you walked in the 
                  classroom, I knew you were scared.  
                  I wanted to let you know you 
                  weren t alone.

                                IAN
                        (realizing)
                  You sent me that note.  So what 
                  signals am I sending now?  

    Ceej looks at him intently.

                                C.J.
                  Tense muscles, darting 
                  eyes...little creeped out.  Kind of  
                  angry.  And...

  Ian suddenly turns away from her, not wanting her to go 
    deeper. 

                                C.J.
                  I m sure your folks miss you, too.

    A moment of reflection for Suki, Gabe and Ian.  It s the 
    elephant in the room.

                                SUKI
                  I like to think mine do.

                                GABE
                  Same here.

                                IAN
                        (quiet)
                  We fought last night.  I never got 
                  to say...
                      (to Suki)
                  How much farther?

    Suki consults her map.

                                SUKI
                  Half mile.  That way.

    Gabe is anxious to impress Ian.

                                GABE
                  Want to know what I can do?                                                                                  37.



                                IAN
                  Does it involve flight,  
                  teleportation or any other way to 
                  get us home?

                                GABE
                  Uh, no.

                                IAN
                  I ll pass.

                                C.J.
                  What about you?

                                IAN
                  I got nothing. 

                                C.J.
                  Really?  No flashes of second 
                  sight, sudden busts of strength... 

    C.J. senses a shift in Ian.

                                C.J.
                  Something, though.  I felt it when 
                  you dropped your eyes. 

                                IAN
                  That s creepy.

                                C.J.
                  But I m not wrong.

  Ian decides to open up.  He tells C.J. What he s never told 
    another soul.  

                                IAN
                  I ve always felt like I was a half 
                  step in front of the rest of the 
                  world.  Like I can see things just 
                  before they happen, and react a 
                  second faster than...

  And with that, he throws C.J. To the ground.  Before the 
    startled Suki and Gabe can react, Ian is leaping forward and 
    firing a powerful kick into the mid-section of an attacking 
    GNOME.  The Gnome hits the ground, then quickly springs back 
  up onto its feet.  The crackling static coming from its 
     face  instantly rises into a wailing SIREN.  It is the exact 
    same semi-electronic, semi-human sound Ian heard after the 
    red-haired kid vanished into the woods.                                                                                   38.



    Across the forest answering SIRENS are heard.  They seem to 
  be moving closer to the kids at a fast pace.  Off the kids 
    terrified expressions, we...

                                 NEW KID 

                                ACT FOUR



  Don, Ray and Zack head toward the dorm s communal bathroom.  
  The guys are wearing robes and carrying towels.  A few other 
  boys move quickly out of their way, showing these are guys 
  most of the rest of the school fears.  One of the boys can t 
  get out of their way fast enough.  Don nods to him in the 
  smug way a bully has of acknowledging a kid worth scaring but 
  not beating up.

                                DON
                        (sneers)
                  Howard.

  The nervous boy smiles, anxious to placate them.                                                                                  47.



                                HOWARD
                  Hey guys.  Hear you got a new 
                  roommate.  

  The trio exchange glances, shake their heads  no  and grin.  
    Ignoring Howard, they continue into the bathroom. 

                                HOWARD
                  Oh well, that s cool.  See ya.



  The boys are taking a shower.  Their robes and towels hang on 
    nearby hooks. 

                                RAY
                  Think Traynor made it as far as the 
                  cliffs?

                                DON
                  I ll bet the Gnomes grabbed him by 
                  the first tree. 

    Suddenly Ian, seen only from the back or in quick glimpses, 
    dashes in and swipes their things.  Don looks up and catches 
  and fleeting glimpse.  

                                DON
                  Hey!  Traynor!  

  The guys run out of the shower.  

                                ZACK
                  Oh man, you are dead!

  The naked bullies race out of the bathroom too angry to be 
    embarrassed. 



  It is a treasure trove of old Frankenstein-like equipment, 
    skeletons in cases, dusty taxidermy animals, creepy things in 
    liquid-filled jars and other scientific paraphernalia of 
    forgotten times.  A centerpiece of the room is an old 
    telescope, mounted to look up through the ceiling.  

  Ian enters with the others and looks around.  He smiles, 
    intrigued with the surroundings.

                                C.J.
                  This is where we met to plan the 
                  escape.  It s the only place on 
                  campus that s completely private.

                                IAN
                  Very cool.

                                GABE
                  It s got that old Skull and Bones 
                  Secret Society charm.  The best 
                  reason a kid should go to prep 
                  school.

    Suki has moved to the old telescope.

                                SUKI
                  This used to be the old 
                  observatory. 

  Ian scrambles up next to her.

                                IAN
                  I m good with astronomy.  Let me 
                  get a fix on the stars and I can 
                  figure out where we are.  

    Suki moves to stop him.

                                SUKI
                  We ve all looked though it, but...

                                C.J.
                  Let him look, Suki.  It s better he 
                  knew.

  Ian looks through the telescope.  

                                IAN
                  This isn t right.                                                                                  51.



    After a second, he looks up, stunned.

                                IAN
                  The stars, everything s out of 
                  place.  
                      (a sobering realization)
                  Are we even in the United States?

  The other kids shrug.  

                                GABE
                  You ve seen the flagpole.  There s 
                  no state flag, no country.  Only 
                  the school.

  Ian is downhearted.  He hadn t counted on this.

                                IAN
                  Didn t think home was so far away.  

                                C.J.
                  How long kids have been brought 
                  here, and what they were trained 
                  for is anyone s guess.  

                                SUKI
                  We still don t know why we re here,
                  Or how we re supposed to develop 
                  our  potential.   

                                IAN
                        (determined)
                  We ll worry about that once we re 
                  gone.

  The other kids listen to Ian with growing respect.  He s what 
  the three desperate kids have needed all along, a leader with 
    a plan.

                                IAN
                  We ll do like C.J. and pretend to 
                  be good little Proges.  Each night, 
                  we ll meet here and map out a real 
                  escape plan.  

                                SUKI
                  I m all for that but...

                                C.J.
                  What?

    Suki brings up that elephant again.  Neither Suki, Ian nor 
    Gabe has wanted to deal with this.                                                                                   52.



                                SUKI
                  You re different, Ceej, you ve been 
                  here all along.  But the three of 
                  us...our parents knew about this.  
                  They sent us here.  If we go back, 
                  what do we go back to?  What will 
                  we have if they reject us?

    After a second, Ian voices the answer that is in all their 
    hearts:

                                IAN
                  Each other.

  Ian puts his hand out.  The other three take it.  As they 
    look into each others eyes, a bond is forged between the 
    four.  Unbreakable, until escape or death do we part.                                                                                  53.
