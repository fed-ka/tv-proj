CIRCA 1993.
Diane walks down the steps to a waiting Porsche, with a
SLEAZY LOOKING, BUT CLEARLY RICH GUY behind the wheel.

CONTINUED:
MINI (V.O.)
Now, if she had been smart, she
would've set her sights a little
lower and gone after a guy who
would've worshipped the ground she
walked on and wouldn't care that
she already had a kid...
CUT TO:
Diane getting into the car. She turns to the driver and gives
him a flirty smile. IT'S NOW A DIFFERENT, but just as SLEAZY
GUY smiling back at her.
MINI (V.O.)
But not mom, she was gonna bag
another elephant if it meant
gobbling every knob from Hollywood
to the Palisades.
As the car pulls away, we see an 8 YEAR OLD MINI watch from
an upstairs window of the building.
Mini walks out the front door, revealing an impressive front
of the house with stone pillars and a brick circular drive.
Martin's MERCEDES 500 SL COUPE and Mini's BMW Z3 convertible
sit in the open garage.
MINI (V.O.)
Their arrangement actually keeps
everything very calm.
Mini gets into her BMW.
The BMW drives down the street, weaving in and out of
traffic.
M
MINI (V.O.)
As I said, the rule of firsts
guides my life. Once you've gotten
into every club in town and had
enough Ivy League lawyers cum too
fast, drastic measures are called
for.
Mini walks past the neon covered shop windows.
MINI (V.O.)
I thought it would be a goof if I
put a photo ad in one of those 25
cent "outcall" massage newspapers
they sell around town. But I just
got a bunch of pervs breathing
heavy on my voice mail. So I went
to an escort service, and when they
found out I was 18, they told me
they had two tricks in the same
hotel that night...if I was up to
it.
She passes OLDER PROSTITUTES soliciting cars that have slowed
down for a peek.
MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Would you look at them?
One of the prostitutes gives her a threatening look.
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It's pathetic. I mean, she's got to
be, what? At least twenty
eight?...In dog years.
(pausing)
Oh, wait, that would make her four.
She arrives in front of the HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT HOTEL.
Mini drives home, suddenly a SIREN is heard and she sees the
FLASHING LIGHTS of a cop car behind her. Mini pulls over
looking pissed.
MINI (V.O.)
Time to bat the eye lashes...
The cop car pulls up behind her and a FEMALE COP WITH A BUZZ
CUT gets out, approaching the car. Mini looks in her mirror,
with a sly smile. The cop reaches Mini's door and looks down
at her, clearly attracted to her.
THE POLICE CRUISER is parked with its lights off.
This time Mini walks in, dressed like a normal high school
student, past a SECURITY GUARD.
MINI (V.O.)
But believe me, they didn't have
too much trouble honoring that
request.
Mini drives into the garage.
MINI (V.O.)
Then one Thursday night I get a a
last minute gig at a fuck pad in
Westwood that some executive keeps
so "wifey" doesn't find the motel
bills on the gold card statements.
They say I'm just his type...young.
LATER.
Mini walks to her car, giddy with excitement.
M
MINI (V.O.)
I literally couldn't feel the
ground under my feet. A first to
top all firsts. I knew I'd tell him
one day, but I wanted to savor it
for a while.
She reaches her car and looks for her keys in her purse. Her
eyebrows furrow as she has trouble finding them. Suddenly,
she realizes they aren't there. She freezes.
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
MARTIN (O.S.)
Ginger! You forgot your...
Startled, her head whips around to see Martin walking towards
her, carrying her jacket. He stops, the realization setting
in.
MARTIN
...Jacket.
Seconds go by as Mini allows a pathologically triumphant
smile to spread across her mouth.
MINI (V.O.)
Here's to immediate gratification.
Martin starts to look nauseous, as Mini walks slowly over and
gives him a deep, wet kiss right on the mouth.
MINI
(whispering)
You were great.
Martin just stares straight ahead, numb. After another moment
he walks to the railing of the garage, staring down at the
street below.
MARTIN'S POV: A few cars rush by on the street below. It
appears to be about a three or four story drop.
He looks back at Mini. He starts to lift a leg over the
railing.
MINI
Uh, that fall probably won't kill
you, and considering what a caring
nurturer your wife is, I don't
think that's a risk you can afford
to take.
Martin looks down at the street for another moment.
MINI (V.O.)
God, what a drama queen. Don't let
this little act fool you. He'd
never let mom get all his money.
He glances back at her, looking tortured.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED: (2)
MINI (V.O.)
This is just his twisted public
relations brain working overtime to
figure what the appropriate
response should be to fucking your
stepdaughter...ah ha! Contemplate
suicide!
M
artin backs away from the railing.
MINI (V.O.)
Now that's thinking outside the
box.
Mini drives home with the top down.
MINI (V.O.)
He told me it was a monumental
mistake and that we should both
never mention it again. I told him
that was fine.
Mini sits at the pool side table, as Martin helps her with
her homework.
M
MINI (V.O.)
Mom thought it was cute how we had
suddenly grown so close, and
thought it was wonderful how Martin
had taken an interest in my
education.
From inside the house, Diane is seen lighting a cigarette,
looking out at them and smiling.
CLOSE ON HER HOMEWORK: Mini has drawn a dirty cartoon which
indicates how well endowed he is. She jots down an arrow next
to the words "actual size".
Martin blushes, averting his eyes.
The two of them sit at a romantic table in the candlelight,
as A WAITER refreshes their wine.
MINI (V.O.)
Now that we were spending time
together, I actually started to
find out what Martin was like for
the first time.
Martin tells her something and they both crack up.
MINI (V.O.)
He wasn't the drip I thought he
was.
The two walk hand in hand, stopping to watch the drum rhythm
circle filled with LOCAL PERCUSSIONISTS and ON LOOKERS moving
to the throbbing beat.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
MINI (V.O.)
He was funny, charming, sweet and
even a little shy.
Mini jumps into the circle, dancing along with the other
revelers. Martin is content to watch, until she runs to the
edge of the circle and pulls him in. Reluctantly, he begins
to move with her and slowly start to enjoy himself.
Mini and Martin walk close together, but not the way couples
do.
MINI (V.O.)
Being seen in public was no sweat,
as long as we didn't act like a
couple.
Martin's Mercedes snakes through an "s" curve, as the lights
M
of the city twinkle in the background.
MINI (V.O.)
This went on for two months, before
we had the talk we both knew was
coming.
The car pulls off the road at one of the tourist overlook
areas with a view of the city.
The car rocks gently back and forth in the rain, as another
car whizzes by, spray flying up behind it as it disappears
around a curve.
Mini swims on her back in the pool, a lit cigarette dangling
between her lips.
MINI (V.O.)
Stamina...
A "MOONWALK" INFLATABLE CARNIVAL RIDE is being inflated on
the front lawn by a WORKER, as TWO JUGGLERS warm up next to
it, tossing clubs between them.
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:
MINI (V.O.)
Phase two: wild shopping sprees
carried out in a euphoric state.
FIVE DELIVERY VANS from Rosa Angelica are parked outside as
FIVE DELIVERY BOYS unload their cargo. It appears that they
have brought the entire inventory of Rosa Angelica. DOZENS OF
BOUQUETS and ARRANGEMENTS line the driveway. Mini stands
outside next to Carlos, sucking on a lollipop.
MINI
Gosh, look at all the pretty
flowers.
CARLOS
Your mother said you are having a
big party!
MINI
(innocently)
I know, can you believe all this?
Just then, Diane's Jaguar pulls into the driveway. She looks
at the trucks, her expression souring. She stops the car and
flies out.
DIANE
Carlos, what the hell is going on?
CARLOS
Senora Tannen, the delivery you
ordered yesterday for the party?
DIANE
Ordered, I didn't order anything?!
Who told you to bring these here?
CARLOS
(flustered)
But, but, Senora, you did, you
called me, I talked to you.
DIANE
No, you didn't!
CARLOS
S, you said you were having a
party, don't you remember?

CARLOS(CONT'D)
You were very excited, saying you
were going to have the most
wonderful party and invite everyone
you knew and it had to be just
perfect. Perfect, that's what you
said.
M
INI
Mom, is that what you were talking
about yesterday?
DIANE
What?!
MINI
Well, it was after lunch and you
had washed your pain killers down
with some wine. You mumbled
something about a party before you
took a nap.
DIANE
No, I did not!
MINI
(wincing)
Mom, you did. The doctor said no
more mixing pain killers and
alcohol.
DIANE
But, but...I only slept for--
MINI
(to Carlos)
I am so sorry. Listen, we'll pay,
don't worry.
Mini leads Carlos back to his vans, just Martin's Mercedes
pulls up. Diane turns around to see his car and a look of
dread strikes her.
DIANE
Oh, god.
MINI (V.O.)
Right on cue. Let's see how
convincing he is.
Martin gets out of the car, surveying the damage. A look of
pure indignant outrage overcomes him and it's impossible to
tell this is an act.
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED: (3)
MARTIN
What is going on?! Carlos, what the
fuck are all these flowers doing
here?!
MINI (V.O.)
Oooh, now I see why he makes the
big bucks.
CARLOS
Seor Tannen, we--
DIANE
Uh, Martin, I, I...
MARTIN
Diane, did you order all this?!
MINI
Mom, go inside, just go, I'll
handle him.
(trying to calm him)
It's under control, Dad. Please,
let's not make a scene.
MONTAGE:
-Mini opens the front door to find A DELIVERY VAN from
WATERFORD CRYSTAL pull up.
MINI (V.O.)
Over the next few days, whenever
Mom had passed out from too much
drinky-drinky...
-The door opens again as A FURRIER holding a full length mink
coat stands before her with a big smile on his face.
MINI (V.O.)
I'd pull out her wallet...
-A SALESMAN dangling the keys to a FORD MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE
which is parked behind him in the driveway.
M
MINI (V.O.)
...and reach out and touch someone.
-A FLATBED TRUCK hauling a 30 FOOT SAILBOAT behind it pulls
up in front of the house.

MINI (V.O.)
It's really remarkable what you can
order with a Platinum card these
days.
Diane is led away by Martin and Mini, as other partygoers
watch the sad scene. They both struggle to keep Diane from
stumbling.
DIANE
(slurring)
...And then I told him that I had
been an extra on Hello Larry and
Mike Farrell had tried to--
MINI
MacLean Stevenson.
DIANE
What?
MINI
MacLean Stevenson played "Larry."
DIANE
Right, that's what I said...and
then MacKenzie Phillips tried to
slip me the tongue!
It is dark and quiet, as the evening dew rises on the lawn.
Two POLICE CRUISERS are parked outside as Diane's body, now
wrapped in a body bag, is being wheeled into the ambulance.
A FEW "LOOKY LOOS" are standing at the gates to the house,
interested to see what's happened.
Martin and Mini arrive in a shuttle bus in front of the lush
resort.
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
MINI (V.O.)
After the funeral, I felt it would
be good idea if we took a vacation
and went somewhere where we could
act like a real couple for the
first time.
Martin spreads sun tan lotion on Mini's back.
MINI (V.O.)
I figured sugar daddy/younger woman
would be old news down there.
A few other OLDER MAN/YOUNGER WOMAN couples lounge near them,
mixed among more traditional pairings.
Mini lies on top of Martin on a lounge chair. They both stare
up at the stars. The gentle breaking of waves further adds to
the tranquility of the evening.
MINI
You know, I've been thinking that I
might enjoy working in your office
this summer.
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:
MARTIN
Really?
Sure, if you want.
MINI
I want.
She moves to kiss him.
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Martin, Mini? Is that you?
Martin and Mini look up to see MIKE RUDELL, their producer
neighbor, peering at them in the dark. He has an arm wrapped
around the waist of A YOUNG BLONDE who is clearly Playmate
material.
MINI (V.O.)
I swear I thought Martin was going
to wet himself.
Mini quickly sits up, trying to make it look like innocent
father/daughter closeness.
MARTIN
(extremely tense)
Oh...hi, Mike, what, what are you
doing here?
R
udell comes over, clearly aware of how un-father/daughter
they were lying.
RUDELL
Last week Mini mentioned you two
were coming here for a little R&R;,
and I suddenly realized I hadn't
taken a vacation in god knows when.
Jennifer, this is my neighbor
Martin Tannen and his daughter,
Mini.
Martin barely looks at Jennifer as he shakes her hand. She
looks equally uncomfortable.
MINI
I'm sorry, but, Jennifer, have we
met? You look so familiar.
Jennifer looks quite uneasy, as she forces a smile.
JENNIFER
I don't think so.
(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED: (2)
MINI (V.O.)
And the icing is that Jennifer
works for the same escort service
that I did. Now this is rich.
MIKE
I wanted you both to know how sorry
I am for your loss.
MINI (V.O.)
Our loss? He just lost six or
seven freebies a year.
MIKE
If there's anything I can do...
(to Mini)
for either of you...
MINI (V.O.)
Yikes, now that Mom's out of the
way, I guess I'm fair game.
MIKE
...don't hesitate to ask. Remember
I'm just right across the fence.
The meaning is not lost on Martin.
MARTIN
(measured)
Thanks, Mike, we appreciate it.
Martin sits on a lounger, reading a book and looking very
unhappy. From the pool, Mini emerges, soaking wet in a
bikini.
MINI (V.O.)
The next few days were a laugh
riot.
Martin looks up from the book, looking around suspiciously.
Suddenly, Mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on the
mouth. He instinctively pulls back.
MINI (V.O.)
Suddenly, Martin was acting like he
really was my father.
Just then, Rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area, waving
at them. Mini's head is not close enough for the scene to
look incriminating, but Martin is too spooked to know the
difference.
Mini answers it, having removed her Marilyn wig, but still in
the sequined dress. Detective Garson stands at the door,
looking her up and down. Mini hides her surprise well.
MINI (V.O.)
Uh oh.
MINI
Yes?
GARSON
Minerva Tannen, Detective Garson, I
don't know if you remember me?
MINI
Drogues, my last name is Drogues.
And "yes", I remember you, you were
the big hearted lug who wanted your
questions answered while my mother
was still warm.
GARSON
(ignoring her dig)
So, Mr. Tannen is your stepfather?
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:
MINI
Nice work, McGruff.
GARSON
Again, I am sorry about that night,
but it is policy that we get the
preliminary facts as soon as
possible.
MINI
What do you want?
GARSON
I need to ask you a few more
questions about your mother's
death.
M
INI
Sure, come on in.
Mini lounges in a bikini, talking on the cordless phone,
while sucking on a red popsicle.
MINI
I played it cool, it would've
looked worse to be defensive.
Mini looks across the yard to see...
MIKE RUDELL looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of
his home. He's dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is
smoking a pipe, which he raises in greeting. His eyes are
locked on hers.
MARTIN (V.O.)
Well, when's he coming over?
MINI
Tonight?
MARTIN (V.O.)
Tonight!? I've got a dinner with
Chapman. I've already cancelled--
(frustrated)
Damn it! Why didn't you call me?!
RUDELL allows the folds of his robe to open in the breeze,
revealing his chest and pair of silk boxers. He's in good
shape for a man his age.
MINI
(annoyed)
Hey, I didn't know you had plans!
Mini responds to Rudell's challenge, lowering a strap on her
bikini top.
(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED:
MARTIN (V.O.)
Listen, I'll be home early so we
can get the story straight.
MINI
Okay.
Mini hangs up the phone, removing the popsicle slowly from
her mouth.
Mini sits in a chair as Martin paces.
MARTIN
What the hell was I thinking,
letting you talk me into this?
MINI
It's probably just routine stuff.
MARTIN
That was not routine, my dear.
MINI
Nice use of the word "us", by the
way.
MARTIN
Sorry, it just slipped out.
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
MINI
If I had a nickel for every time I
heard that-
MARTIN
(sharply)
Okay.
MINI
Look, just chill, I'm sure this
will blow over in a few days.
MARTIN
Chill?! Believe me, we'll be
chilling in a pine box if he
figures everything out. You do
understand they could go for the
death penalty?
MINI
He's probably just trying to spook
us.
MARTIN
Hello?! They don't try and spook
you unless they think you did it!
MINI
It was a great plan, no one can
prove we stuck those sleeping pills
in her mouth, because we didn't.
MARTIN
(seething)
Well, if it was such a great plan,
why am I cancelling business
dinners to accommodate a detective
who appears convinced it wasn't a
suicide?
Mini glares at him and then stands up, heading inside.
MINI
I'll see you later.
MARTIN
Where are you going?
MINI
Out.
87.
Mini's car pulls into the driveway. She gets out, looking
rumpled.
Martin walks outside, frustrated. His cell goes off and he
answers it.
MARTIN
Yeah?
LOIS (O.S.)
Mr. Tannen, I just spoke to Mr.
Chapman...he told me to tell you
that he's going to be seeking a new
firm to handle his company's needs.
Martin's jaw tightens.
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
MARTIN
Thank you, Lois.
Martin hangs up the phone, as he looks up, he sees across the
street a large sign on a modern office building: RUDELL
WORLDWIDE ENTERTAINMENT.
Martin closes his eyes, trying to remain in control.
Mini walks up the long driveway.
MINI (V.O.)
With Mommy Dearest out of the way,
I decided to take the matter of
Rudell into my own hands. I knew
Martin wouldn't approve, but at
this point...action had to be
taken.
She arrives at the front door and rings the bell.
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED:
MINI (V.O.)
I would catch him off guard,
disorient him and then kill him...
The door opens and Rudell stands before her in the same plush
bathrobe.
MINI (V.O.)
...with kindness.
MINI
Hi, Mr. Rudell, I'm sorry to bother
you.
RUDELL
Not at all, as I said down in
Mexico...
(slightly lascivious)
anything for a neighbor.
MINI
May I come in?
Mini and Rudell sit at a table, enjoying iced teas, as Mini
flirts shamelessly with him.
MINI (V.O.)
Much to my surprise, I was invited
to stay for a refreshing
beverage...
Rudell shows Mini around his collection of rare tropical
flowers. He plucks a tiger lily off a stem and puts it in her
hair.
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
MINI (V.O.)
I knew he had had no shortage of
young women in his bed, but he had
been paying for it in one form or
another for a long time.
Rudell shows Mini how to use a pitching wedge on the small
putting green off his back patio. He stands behind her,
wrapping his arms around her, guiding her arms through the
swing.
MINI (V.O.)
And the one undeniable fact I had
learned from Martin is that there
is no greater thrill or triumph in
a man's life...
Mini walks out of a movie theater, with Kayla and TWO BOYS.
MINI (V.O.)
Our relationship had turned into
what some might call...
A few seconds later, Martin walks out of the theater, wearing
dark glasses and a hat. He follows them.
MINI (V.O.)
...unhealthy.
Martin stands outside and rings the bell. The door opens and
Rudell stands there in a smoking jacket and pajamas. He looks
Martin up and down with a self-satisfied smile, as Sinatra's
R
"Nice and Easy" is playing on his stereo in the background.
UDELL
Martin, what a surprise, how are
you?
MARTIN
Just watched Mini on your show.
RUDELL
Ahh...was tonight the night? We
taped that two weeks ago. Let me
tell you, I have girls audition all
the time for me and...
(enjoying this)
She was fucking incredible.
Rudell watches Martin's eyes for a reaction.
MARTIN
A natural, huh?

115.

RUDELL
Like a duck to water...and totally
willing to take direction.
Martin's jaw tightens, as Rudell is loving twisting the knife
in him.
RUDELL
I wish all the girls I worked with
had her...how can I put this?...
Need to please.
MARTIN
You son of a bitch...
Martin explodes, punching Rudell in the mouth, sending him
staggering backwards inside.
SINATRA (V.O.)
"Let's take it nice and easy..."
Rudell and Martin crash through the plate glass window on to
the brick patio. Martin gets to his feet first and grabs a
golf club propped up on a chair next to the putting green.
SINATRA (V.O.)
"The problem now of course is, to
simply hold your horses..."
Rudell struggles to his feet, just in time to see the
pitching wedge heading straight for his ribs. THWACK! Martin
catches him square and he goes down like a sack of potatoes.
Martin starts hitting him with one swing after another.
SINATRA (V.O.)
"To rush would be a crime..."
Rudell cries out in agony, as the blows smash one rib after
another.
MARTIN
You son of a bitch! How's that
feel?! You like that?! You thought
you could have my wife and my
daughter too?!
SINATRA (V.O.)
"`Cause nice and easy does it, nice
and easy does it..."
Martin bends down and grabs Rudell's hair, twisting his head
around so he can look him in the eye. In the distance a SIREN
is heard getting closer.
(CONTINUED)
117.

MARTIN
Sorry, pal, she's mine! Diane may
have taken pity on you between
vodkas, but not her! Not her!
Martin smashes his face into the patio. Rudell lets out a
moan, grasping at the ground, trying to get up, but his legs
don't obey him. Martin stands up and grabs the club, raising
it with both hands above his head for a final swing.
M
ARTIN
Now tell me where they are or I
swear to god, I'll crack your head
open!
MINI (O.S.)
Martin, don't!
He turns around to see Mini, tears coming down her cheeks,
standing ten feet away. The SIRENS suddenly stop.
MARTIN
Go look for the negatives!
MINI
No! This is insane!
MARTIN
We need the negatives!
He raises the club again. Mini runs for him, grabbing his arm
before it comes down.
MINI
You're gonna kill him!
He tries to pull the club away.
MARTIN
What are you doing! He'll tell
everyone!
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Freeze, police!
Martin turns around to see TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS with their
guns drawn. Martin looks down at Rudell, gasping for air, his
face covered in blood. He looks at his own blood-soaked
clothes, the reality hitting him.

OFFICER
Drop the club and put your hands
up!
Martin obeys and Mini runs into the arms of the second
officer. The first one moves quickly to Martin and shoves him
on the ground.
MINI
Thank God! Thank God, you came!
MARTIN
Mini, you called them?! How could
you call them?!
Mini buries her face in the officer's chest.
MINI
He's...he's crazy, I told him not
to! I told him to stop!
SINATRA (V.O.)

FADE OUT:
Mini emerges from the station with her lawyer as a throng of
REPORTERS jostle for a photo.

Needless to say, my appearance on
Absolutely Positive was the most
sought after clip in every newsroom
in town.
TV VIDEO FOOTAGE OF: Mini at Martin's trial sitting in the
front row.
MINI (V.O.)
The trial was quick. Once Mom's
affair with Rudell came out, the
D.A. realized he had a motive and a
slam dunk.
T

towards Martin and then reads the verdict.
FOREWOMAN
Guilty.

Martin stares straight ahead, showing no emotion as Mini sobs
behind him.
MINI (V.O.)
Since, Rudell was in a coma, the
issue of my relationship with
Martin was moot. Martin realized
trying to pin anything on me would
probably get him the chair.
Martin, wearing an ORANGE PRISON UNIFORM, is led into a van
by a DEPUTY.
MINI (V.O.)
At his sentencing I begged for
leniency. He got off with ten for
the attempted murder of Rudell and
twenty to life for mom's death.
Mini opens the door to find reporters camped on the lawn,
snapping photos. Dozens of bouquets and wreaths are piled up
next to the front door.
MINI (V.O.)
The outpouring of support was
amazing.
A MAILMAN hauls a bag of sympathy cards to the front door.
She leads him inside where he dumps them next to three other
bags full.
The sun is blistering hot as Mini drives Martin's Mercedes
convertible with the top down.
MINI (V.O.)
Martin's assets were put in a trust
for me and since I was eighteen, I
was allowed to live by myself.
She turns down another road at a sign reading "LOMPOC STATE
PRISON, 5 MILES".

SENIORS in gowns sit awaiting their diplomas, as PARENTS sit
in the audience, fanning themselves with programs. Mini
stands at the dais, addressing the class.
MINI (V.O.)
...As many of you know, the past
few months of my life have been
very difficult. I don't know how I
would have gotten through it
without all of you. I really think
it is a testament to the love in

medication and therapy, Marvin
should be able to attend Harvard
this fall.
A polite smattering of applause is heard.
MINI
While I may not have excelled in
the classroom, I think my recent
experiences in that bigger
schoolhouse we call "life", have
taught me a few lessons that I'd
like to share with my fellow
graduates.
Her classmates instinctively lean forward a little to listen.
MINI
Follow your heart and don't
question it, now matter where it
tells you to go. Trust me, it'll
open up a world of new experiences
you can't even imagine.
Principal Andrews nods in approval.
MINI
But as you listen to it, don't
forget your family, your parents.
Don't forget they're people too,
and while we may not always agree
with them, remember to love them
when they need love.
A few PARENTS look almost surprised to hear positive things
said about them.
MINI
(voice breaking)
And I mean really love them, don't
just pay them lip service. Really
do it...Whenever you can.

I know I did, and I just wish my
dad could be here today, so after
this speech I could just walk down
into the audience and give him my
love right here...in front of all
of you. Thank you and good luck.
Mini puts her speech down, gently sobbing, as THE AUDIENCE
ERUPTS. PRINCIPAL ANDREWS moves quickly to console her.
MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Like I promised, no prom night
highjinks, no nerds becoming
popular, no Shakespeare shoved up
your ass.
MINI'S FELLOW GRADUATES give her a standing ovation. A few
PARENTS become misty-eyed.
MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And in case you're feeling guilty
about having no one to identify
with but me, relax...
MINI looks out across the crowd and a huge smile ripples
across her face, as she waves to everyone in the golden
sunlight.
MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...There's a first time for
everything.
