
      The hyperactive Lois Lane is pacing back and forth in DR. 
      FRISKIN's office.

                                     LOIS
                     I want one man.  One whole man.  Is 
                     that so much to ask?  And what do I 
                     have to choose from?  There's one 
                     guy who could be really wonderful 
                     only he disappears every time I try 
                     to talk to him, and one guy who's 
                     exciting to be with only he won't 
                     talk to me about his work and what 
                     do people talk about if they can't 
                     talk about what they did all day, 
                     and one guy who's out of this 
                     world... literally.

                                     DR. FRISKIN
                     I thought you'd given up the 
                     Superman fantasy.

                                     LOIS
                     My head wants to.  My heart is, um,
                     conflicted.

                                     DR. FRISKIN
                     So it would seem.

      Lois sits.

                                     LOIS
                     Can we go over my options?

                                     DR. FRISKIN
                     Well, your current options are one 
                     wonderful guy who's apparently 
                     afraid of commitment, one exciting 
                     guy who apparently wants to control 
                     the conversation, and one superhero 
                     who's apparently unattainable.  Or 
                     it could be that none of them is 
                     right for you.

      There's silence, then:

                                     LOIS
                     You know, you have this annoying 
                     habit of giving me back what I just 
                     said.

      Dr. Friskin smiles.

                                     DR. FRISKIN
                     Sometimes we can't really hear what 
                     we're saying unless someone 
                     reflects it back.

      Lois still can't hear it.  She's stuck on:

                                     LOIS
                     They just all make me so mad!

                                     DR. FRISKIN
                     And what do you think you might
                     want to do about that?

      Off Lois' reaction...



      Lois is at her desk.  She's copying some names and numbers 
      from her Rolodex when Clark comes up with two cups of 
      coffee.  He holds one out to her.  She ignores it and 
      ignores him.

                                     CLARK
                     Lois...

      Jimmy's walking by.

                                     LOIS
                          (to Jimmy)
                     Did you hear something, Jimmy?

                                     JIMMY
                          (stops)

                                     LOIS
                     It sounded a little like my name.
                     You didn't say 'Lois,' did you?

      Uh-oh.

                                     JIMMY
                     I didn't.  Clark did.

                                     LOIS
                     Clark who?

                     There it is again.

      Jimmy looks from Lois to Clark and back again.  Nope, this 
      is not worth it.  He moves off in a hurry.

      She wheels on him, overrides him:

                                     LOIS
                     What?  No, don't say a word, allow 
                     me: 'Lois, I can explain, I 
                     suddenly remembered that my 
                     mother's sister's poodle needed a 
                     haircut and so you can see why I 
                     had to leave you in the middle of a 
                     date with your thumb in your ear 
                     but I'm sure you understand.' How 
                     am I doing so far, Clark?

      Without waiting for an answer, she turns her back on him and 
      dials a phone number.  From a distance, Perry watches as 
      Clark goes to his desk and sits.

                                                                       (X)

      BARRY BARKER, 40's, is at his desk, Calvin's across from
      him:

                                     BARRY BARKER
                     Superman?

      Calvin nods.

                                     BARRY BARKER (CONT'D)
                     Superman?

      Barry Barker is a weasel, a ferret, a toad, a snake.  For a
      moment, we can't tell whether he's eager or reticent about
      taking on Superman.

      But now his eyes start to glitter, he grins and all but rubs 
      his hands together gleefully.

                                     BARRY BARKER (CONT'D)
                     Finally, I'll be famous!  Finally, 
                     I'll get respect!  Finally, women 
                     will sense my power!

      Calvin doesn't like the way this is going.

                                     CALVIN
                     Excuse me.  This is about me.

                                     BARRY BARKER
                     Of course it is, my boy.  I know 
                     that.  I never lose sight of the 
                     true objective.

      He's risen from his desk and has nudged Calvin out of his 
      chair and is now escorting him to the door as he talks.

                                     BARRY BARKER (CONT'D)
                     I'll take your case, and it won't 
                     cost you a cent, I'll be working 
                     absolutely on contingency, forty 
                     percent of the settlement when we 
                     win.

                                     CALVIN
                     Forty percent?

                                     BARRY BARKER
                     Could you ask the receptionist to
                     step in here, please?

      He shuts the door on Calvin, stands there with his mind 
      racing.

                                     BARRY BARKER (CONT'D)
                     Barry Barker versus The Man of
                     Steel.

      He's a happy man.  There's a timid KNOCK on the door, then 
      it opens to reveal the RECEPTIONIST, a little old lady.

                                     BARRY BARKER (CONT'D)
                     You'll have to work late tonight.  
                     There's a little something I need 
                     for you to do.



      Barry Barker's receptionist is standing in the open window
      high above the street below.  Barker is holding her by the
      waistband.  In his other hand, a legal-looking document.

                                     MA BARKER
                     Help!

      It comes out weak. Barker grimaces.

                                     BARRY BARKER
                     Louder, Mother.

                                     MA BARKER
                     Help!  Help!

      It's still weak.  Barker loosens his grip on the waistband,
      and the old lady teeters, her eyes widening in terror.



      Barker wasn't really going to let her fall.  He now has a
      good grip on her again.

                                     BARRY BARKER
                     Much better, Mother.

      Superman appears, quickly maneuvers the old lady off the
      ledge and back into the office.  He turns a stern eye on
      Barry Barker.

                                     SUPERMAN
                     What exactly do you think you're
                     doing, sir?

      Barker slaps the legal document in Superman's hand.

                                     BARRY BARKER
                     Superman, you have just been

      BOBBY BIGMOUTH, talking into the receiver, a bunch of food
      on the counter.  He's opening cartons as he talks.

                                     BOBBY
                     I don't see any duck here, Lois.  I

                     duck in advance.

      Bobby opens a carton, reacts.

                                     BOBBY
                     Ooooh, Hunan beef, I love Hunan
                     beef!

      He pops the piece into his mouth, chews ecstatically.

                     'yes' or 'no' to companies that 
                     want to market new drugs.

                                     LOIS
                     No. You must have the wrong
                     Scardino.

                                     BOBBY
                     If you say so.

      Lois ponders it for a moment, then:

                                     LOIS
                     What's the rest of it?

      At Lois' end, we hear the connection go.

      The DOORBELL RINGS.  Lois hangs up.

                                     LOIS (CONT'D)
                     Who is it?

                                     DAN (O.S.)
                     It's me, Dan.

      Lois opens the door.  Dan's there, with a clipboard in one 
      hand, pencil in the other.

                                     DAN
                     Hello.  I'm doing a survey of women 
                     who resent having gifts sent to 
                     them.  Please answer 'true' or 
                     'false':  Wrapping paper offends 
                     me... I am psychologically unable 
                     to accept gifts... Gifts are okay, 
                     I just don't like the guy who sent 
                     then...

      He's being very charming, but Lois has her own agenda:

                                     LOIS
                     It's not about gifts, Dan. It's
                     about trust.

      Dan was really hoping the charm would work, but he can see
      it's a forlorn hope. He sighs.

      A few minutes later.  The TV is still on, but the sound is 
      very low.  Dan is mid-explanation:

                                     DAN
                     ... it's not just dangerous for 
                     _you_ to know what I'm doing, it's 
                     dangerous for _me_.

      Lois is entering the room with a tray: coffee and cookies.
      As she sets it down on the coffee table:

                                     LOIS
                     That's what I'm saying, Dan.  You
                     don't trust me.

      Before Dan can respond, his BEEPER GOES OFF.  He unclips it,
      looks at the number.  Lois is leaning over in front of him 
      and can see the number.

      Lois looks away from the beeper as Dan looks up.  She
      continues pouring coffee for him. Dan resumes the
      conversation:

                                     DAN
                     I think you're looking for
                     something that doesn't exist,  Lois.
                     The perfect man, the perfect
                     relationship, the perfect life...
                     Will you excuse me for a minute?

      He takes a cel phone out of his pocket and walks away to get
      a little privacy.

                                     DAN (CONT'D)
                     This won't take a second.

      To his back:

                                     LOIS
                     Nirvana?

      Dan's antennae go up.  He turns.

                                     DAN
                     What?

      His reaction fuels her suspicions.

                                     LOIS
                          (innocently)
                     The perfect life.  Nirvana.  Eden.
                     Utopia.  Camelot.

      Dan relaxes.  Must've been a fluke.

                                     DAN
                          (patiently)
                     Yeah...  Those places don't exist,
                     Lois.  The real world is what we
                     have to deal with.

      And here comes the real world, Metropolis style.  Superman
      appears at the window, behind Dan.  He's holding the summons
      that Barry Barker served.  Dan sees Lois' eyes shift to the
      window, and he feels the breeze.  He turns.  Neither he nor
      Superman is pleased to see the other.

      A few minutes later.  Dan is in the kitchen, talking softly 
      into his cel phone.  Yes, Superman _could_ tune in his 
      superheating to overhear Dan's conversation, but he's got 
      his own problems.  Lois finishes reading the subpoena.

                                     SUPERMAN
                     I've never been sued before.  I'm
                     not sure how to proceed.

                                     LOIS
                     You need a lawyer.  I know a guy 
                     who handles stuff like this, and 
                     he's never lost a case.

      Superman sits across from CONSTANCE HUNTER.  She's fortyish.
      Her office is dark -- blinds closed, sunlight struggling to 
      get in but losing the battle, a single desk lamp lit.  Lots 
      of law books, both current and old, line the walls.  
      Constance is calm and focused and kind.  She's listened
      empathetically to Superman's story, which is winding up now.

                                     CONSTANCE
                     What was his response?

      Superman smiles.

                                     SUPERMAN
                     He seems to have only one response

                     Nothing is ever right, and nothing 
                     is ever enough.  They stand alone

      Lois is at her desk.  In front of her is a pad with a phone 
      number written on it, a number we've seen before: 555-0373.
      Lois dials the number.  After a couple of RINGS:

      There's a BEEP.  Lois hangs up, looks over to another part

      several TV sets.

                     veiled power struggles, apparently 
                     having little regard for the colony 
                     as a whole...

      As we're HEARING this, we're PANNING over to Perry and Jimmy 
      to find that the voice over is coming, not from C-SPAN, but
      from The Nature Station, which they're watching.                 (X)

      Lois decides not to travel down this road, whatever it is.  
      Instead:

                     I need some research, Jimmy.  I 
                     want to know everything there is to 
                     know about Omnicorp and Charles 
                     Knox.  He's the president.

                     mates only once, with tragic
                     consequences for all concerned.
                     But the species survives and
                     thrives, and the little newly

                     Go be Chuckles the Clown on your

                     Now... we want FDA approval on the 
                     drug.  We want it by the first of 
                     the year.  And we want it 
                     guaranteed.

                     You got it.

      Knox walks off, leaving the case.  Dan hefts the case and 
      walks down the hall to the elevator, pushes the button, 
      waits.  Then, from behind him --

                     life I've basically been attracting
                     men who are controlling or
                     incomplete or downright liars
                     because... because...

                                     LOIS
                     ... because I like being treated
                     like that?  But wait, then how come
                     if I like this kind of man and I
                     always seem to set this kind of
                     man, I'm not happy?

                     You like chocolate, right?  But you
                     know it's bad for you.  And the
                     older and wiser you get, the less
                     tolerance you have for something
                     that's bad for you.  You're not a

      These words hit Lois hard.

                     ... so stop acting like one.  You 
                     know who you want to be with.  
                     You've known all along.  The 
                     problem is, he's just as scared as

      Moments before Superman's trial.  On one side of the bar,
      Calvin and Barker; behind them, in the gallery, Elise.  On 
      the other side, Superman and Constance; behind them in the 
      gallery, Perry, Jimmy, Dan and Lois.  The room is packed, 
      dotted with PEOPLE in neck braces, slings and bandages.

      Lois tries to hide the effect of another disappointment.

      Both men nod sagely and glance at Lois.  Dan, sitting beside 
      her, takes her hand.

      Sitting at the bar, Superman glances back and sees Dan 
      holding Lois's hand.  He tries not to let it hurt.  Lois 
      sees the look on his face.  Their eyes meet for a second, 
      she's curious, then... The JUDGE enters, everyone rises.



      Elise on the stand, nervous, under direct exam by Barker:

                                     ELISE

                     Oh, they're... mmmm, they're bad...
                     um, he's not himself.                             (X)

      The Judge glances at Calvin.  Calvin slumps low in his chair 
      and shields his eyes with his hand, a mournful and forlorn 
      figure of suffering and sorrow.  Lois looks at Calvin, 
      disgusted.

      A break in the proceedings.  People mill.  Elise gets some
      water.  Lois walks up.

                                     LOIS
                     Can I ask you a question?  How can

                     a man who won't even admit he's

      Elise looks at her, like a deer caught in headlights.

                     you can be but I'll tell you the 
                     difference between him and
                     Calvin -- he wants my happiness 
                     more than his own.  I feel it every 
                     second I'm with him, and sometimes 
                     there aren't enough of those 
                     seconds and the ones we _do_ have 
                     end a little abruptly but Elise,
                     Calvin doesn't feel that way about
                     you and someday he'll prove it in
                     the ugliest way he can.

      Elise, stunned, moves back to court. A man bumps her from
      behind and mutters an excuse.  As he slips into the
      courtroom, we see it's the Assassin, with his attache case.



      The Assassin sets his attache in the aisle near Lois and
      Dan, twists the snap-lock and --

      forms of liquid explosive. Smoke rises and curls.



      The Assassin gets up and exits the court room, just as

                     I'm sorry, your Honor, but I think 
                     what I'm smelling is C-12, it's an 
                     explosive...
                          (sniffs)
                     ... and it's burning, somewhere in

                     disgraceful form of courtroom 
                     theatrics I've _ever_ witnessed.

      Superman moves into the gallery, sniffing and searching.

                     Superman, should we evacuate the
                     building?

                                     SUPERMAN
                     Everyone stay calm, I think... yes,
                     it's right...
                          (picks up Assassin's attache)
                     ... here.

      He opens it, revealing the bubbling, smoking bomb.  PEOPLE 
      jump and SCREAM, startled and terrified.

                                     ELISE
                     Oh, my God...

      Superman hugs the bomb to him and takes off, going straight 
      up in a whooshing BLUE AND RED BLUR.

      The sound of Superman CRASHING through the ceiling.  Plaster 
      chunks and bits of dust cascade down.  Some of it lands on 
      Calvin.  He starts to dust it off, annoyed, then a thought 
      strikes Barry Barker, who nudges Calvin, and suddenly "in 
      agony" --

                                     CALVIN
                     My eyes!

      He makes a blind-man grope and tumbles over a chair.  Elise 
      and Barker kneel to him.

                                     BARKER
                     Calvin, Calvin... are you all
                     right?  Someone get a doctor!

      Then the SOUND of an ENORMOUS BLAST echoes from above.  
      Everyone looks up, frozen.

      The doors open and Superman strides in, smoke sizzling off 
      his suit, holding the charred remains of the bomb in his 
      hands.

      Barker turns to her, stunned.  So does Calvin.

                     It didn't hurt that you saved the

      They share a warm look, then she moves off.  Lois walks out 
      of court with Elise.

                     the worst sides of ourselves.  I've 
                     tried to love you but I realized 
                     today how selfish that is.  You're

                     how to get him to see it.

      Another kiss on the cheek and she turns.

                     Lois, I need --

      She stops.  So does she.

      She watches till he's gone with an O.S. WHOOSH that blows 
      back her hair.

                     Sorry.  Couldn't help myself.

      She takes them and smiles.

      Clark is alone, on the phone.  RINGING, then the sound of

                     And so what are we to learn from 
                     the mating habits of insects, 
                     reptiles and mammals?  What does it 
                     teach us about ourselves?  That 
                     we're not the only creatures on the

      She knocks.  He moves away from the drone of the TV to the
      door and opens it.

                     Hi.

                                     CLARK
                     Hi.

                                     LOIS
                          (peering in)
                     You planning a yard sale?
                          (suddenly shifts gears)
                     Wait, wait.  That's a form of
                     distancing.  My therapist -- I
                     know, I have a therapist, can you
                     believe it? -- she says I say
                     things like that to distance, so we
                     don't really have to deal with
                     anything and it's very complicated
                     and linked to a lot of boring
                     childhood trauma and... can I come
                     in?

      As she does --

                                     LOIS
                     I told Superman I just want to be
                     friends... that there's someone
                     else...  And Dan and I --                         (X)

                     Look, Lois, if you came here to
                     tell me that you and Dan are...                   (X)

                     We're not going to see each other

                          (off his surprise,

                     This isn't just vacation packing,
                     is it?  This is forever packing.

                                     CLARK
                     I was thinking of moving but...                   (X)
                     now I'm not so sure.                              (X)

                                     LOIS
                     What, you were just going to slip 
                     out of town, not even tell me?  
                     Maybe send me a post card from -- ?
                          (stops)
                     Distancing, distancing.  Sorry.                   (X)
                     But this is... I mean, _leaving_, I
                     didn't expect this.

                                     CLARK
                     Lois, we haven't been very happy 
                     with each other lately.  And it's 
                     my fault and I think I should --

                                     LOIS
                     Yes, it _is_ your fault.   And my 
                     fault.  We let ourselves get 
                     distracted and we let ourselves get 
                     hurt too easily and we work too 
                     much and we argue over stupid 
                     things... all so we can hide from 
                     each other and I'm sick of it, 
                     Clark.  Because the only reason we 
                     hide is, we're scared.

                                     CLARK
                     Of what?

                                     LOIS
                     The fact that we're partners...
                     best friends... and _this_.

      She launches herself at him in a passionate kiss.  He's 
      taken aback for a moment, then returns the kiss, deeply and
      passionately.

      Lois breaks from the kiss, her lips close to his as she          (X)
      speaks:

                     If you want to run away from this,
                     tell me now.

                                     CLARK
                     I won't run, Lois.  I'm ready for
                     the next step if you are.

      They kiss again, as we MOVE TO the TV nearby and see a 
      MONTAGE of paired animals nuzzling, hugging...

                                     PFINCH-LUPUS (V.O.)
                     We seek the comfort of another...
                     someone to shape and share the life
                     we choose... someone to help us 
                     through the never-ending attempt to
                     understand ourselves... and, in the 
                     end, someone to comfort us along 
                     the way.

      ... and the final image: two Koala bears, side by side, 
      slumbering in one another's arms.  And then REVEAL our 
      Host, stepping in front of the blue screen of the bears.
