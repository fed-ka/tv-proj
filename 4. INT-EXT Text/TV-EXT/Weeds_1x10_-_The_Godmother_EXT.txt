                  I m up.

                                NANCY 
                  Okay.  Clean fight.  

                                SHANE
                  Yeah, yeah.

    Shane assumes his position in the circle across from another  *
    boy, his opponent.  PETER walks over to Nancy.   *

                                PETER
                  Hey.

                  Oh hi.  Peter.  Hi Peter.

                                PETER
                  Hi Nancy.  It s nice to see you.

                                NANCY
                  You too.  Seeing.  

                                PETER
                  I was hoping to hear from you.

                                NANCY
                  Yes.  You know, I should have 
                  called you.  I ve been meaning to.

                                PETER
                  Do you still have my number?

                                NANCY
                  I do.  I have it.  I ll call and 
                  there will be fun.  It ll be fun.  
                  We ll have fun.

    They smile at each other.

    ANGLE ON: Shane making snarling faces at the boy.  He bares  *
    and gnashes his teeth.  

    The ref signals for them to bow and commence.  Shane starts 
    to bark like a dog.  The boy turns and runs out of the ring  *
    and hides. *

                                PETER 
                  I guess Shane s reputation precedes  *
                  him.*

                  Then I could float in a pool of

                  no parental rights anymore because 
                  I m a drug dealer.  How the fuck

                  Hey, I don t have to apologize for 
                  being a weed dealer.  It s a choice 
                  I made.  And I m okay with it.  As 
                  a matter of fact, turns out I m 
                  really good at it.   For the first 
                  time in my life, I took control of 
                  a situation and I made it work.  
                  For me.  For my family.  And I m 
                  not sorry.

                                ANDY
                  You don t have to be sorry.  He s
