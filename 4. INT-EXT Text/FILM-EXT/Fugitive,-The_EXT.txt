CREDITS BEGIN OVER:
Snow swirls around the tall buildings of downtown Chicago.
Cars, taxis, limos line the street. A cab pulls up and MAN
in tuxedo moves into:
Kimble pulls up in front of his house. Suddenly both his
PAGER and CAR PHONE RING at the same time.
KIMBLE
(to phone)
Dr. Kimble
(suddenly attentive)
When? Okay, tell them I'll be there
in ten minutes.
He hangs up.
KIMBLE
Tim's got a problem.
Helen kisses him again, opens the door.
HELEN
Call me on your way home.
CREDITS END as we -
CUT TO:
Kimble driving.
Snow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the
driveway. On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still
on.
Two Chicago police cars wheel to the curb, COPS move quickly
to the house.
The street is filled with Chicago police cars, curious
neighbors, television news vans, etc.
Kimble is helped into a police car as the coroner's van
arrives. He pauses a moment to watch as we hear.
DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.)
Can you give us a little more to go
on besides the fact that he had an
artificial arm? What kind of gun was
it, Doc?
Chicago Sun-Times has a photograph of Kimble spread across
the front page.
MAN (V.O.)
... If you two come up with a deal,
I'll listen, but let me make one
thing perfectly clear.
Main gates open. The BUS GRINDS onto the streets.
The BUS RUMBLES north, heading towards the horizon.
As the bus careens off the road, accelerating.
As the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground.
The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope
and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the
bottom of a small ravine.
The bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend
grows bright by the light of an approaching train.
Downtrack, one Cyclops light appears.
... and hits the ground running the other way. The
locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus.
As the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK.
Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard
behind him. He slings the man clear.
SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer.
For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus.
The train light X-rays him.
Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint
away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a
dozen mincing steps before...
IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus,
splitting it open.
Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his
feet, still running feverish half-steps.
An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its
flanks.
The train burns past the wounded Guard.
Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind
him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life:
Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming
after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being
chased by a fire-breathing locomotive.
The train burrows to a stop.
Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval
of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that
nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices
something in his hand.
It's the key-ring.
Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key.
Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away.
COPELAND (O.S.)
Give me that.
Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his
own chains.
COPELAND
You listen to me. I don't give a
damn which way you go, just don't
follow me.
Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his
arm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the
other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.
DISSOLVE TO:
News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing
smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines
hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work
feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled
wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation
investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted
remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators.
Two American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S.
marshals emerge:
BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick
shithouse.
RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds
fully-equipped.
POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during
nut-cuttin' time.
NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5.
From the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media
spectacle.
GERARD
Good lord...
REFRO
What is this... a circus?
As a group they begin moving along the service road above
the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below
them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they
walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials.
Biggs spots something...
BIGGS
Point of impact.
... and branches off.
GERARD
Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman.
BIGGS
Shit.
(to Newman)
Come on.
They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain
with Gerard.
A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he
sees Gerard's Marshall star.
GERARD
How ya doing? Who's in charge?
TROOPER
Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the
lights -
Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the
scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him.
Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's
about to happen.
ANGLE - OLD GUARD
Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his
shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG
SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote
news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the
b.g., listening.
OLD GUARD
... train was bearin' down on us,
fast. I don't know how - it's still
kind of hazy - but I grabbed him
and pushed him out of the bus.
SHERIFF
You coulda both been killed.
OLD GUARD
I know, but hell, he's my partner.
Woulda done the same for me.
The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard
eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts.
GERARD
Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy
U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard.
SHERIFF
(annoyed)
I'll be with you in a minute.
The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields
his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos
of all four prisoners.
SHERIFF
(to Old Guard)
For the record. These three dead.
And this one...
He switches to a photo of Kimble.
OLD GUARD
Well, everything happened so fast...
(bites lip, decides)
Huh-uh. Don't think he made it.
Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred
prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.
SHERIFF
You get some rest.
He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.
SHERIFF
Looks like you came a long way for
nothing. My men've already done a
thorough search from point of
impact and found nothing.
INTERCUT WITH:
ANGLE - CULVERT
Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees
something. He orders Newman into the muck after it.
GERARD
Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.
GERARD
With all due respect, may I suggest
check-points starting at a 15-mile
radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east
of -
SHERIFF
Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what?
Prisoners are all dead. The only
thing check-points will do is get a
lot of good people out here frantic
and flood my office with calls.
Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and
we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.
GERARD
(beat)
Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for
that to happen... So, I'll be
taking over the investigation.
SHERIFF
On whose authority?
GERARD
By authority of the Governor of the
State of Illinois and the office of
the United States Marshal, 5th
District Northern Illinois...
Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents
from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.
SHERIFF
(back-down beat)
Okay. You want jurisdiction over
this mess, you got it.
(to assistants)
Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to
mop up for us.
He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out.
Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's
manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.
Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to
a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.
GERARD
Please, ladies and gentlemen, step
back and give this poor man some
room.
Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a
change of story and command.
Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the
Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.
GERARD
(friendly, to Old
Guard)
Always an interesting thing when we
find leg irons and no legs in them
who held the keys, sir?
OLD GUARD
Uh, me.
GERARD
Would you be so kind as to show them
to me, sir?
Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.
The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the
press hovering just out of earshot.
GERARD
Second chance.
Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.
The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.
OLD GUARD
(cracking)
He mighta got out.
GERARD
Thank you.
SHERIFF
What the hell is this? A minute ago
you tell me he's part of the
wreckage, now you're -
GERARD
Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want
an accurate body count. Poole - Set
up operations right here.
He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving
downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like
Israelites behind Moses.
GERARD
Ladies and gentlemen... our
fugitive's been on the run for
ninety minutes. Average foot speed
over uneven ground - barring injury
is approximately four miles an hour,
giving us a radius of six miles. I
want a hard-target search of any
residence, gas station, farmhouse,
henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in
that area. Check-points go up at
15 miles.
(to media)
You got that? Good. Now, turn
those damn things off and get out
of our way.
Flashing lights. Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks.
The SQUAWK of police RADIOS breaks the rural quiet. A moment
later a HELICOPTER ROARS overhead.
Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with
blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's
going to need stitches.
Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps
moving.
Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction
of the lights.
A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the
road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2
mile.
ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM
Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he
nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign.
He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison
jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his
breath.
Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off
the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for
cover behind the wrecked car.
The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front
seat and closes the door.
He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets
something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door
and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the
coveralls missing from the seat.
As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite
side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window,
clutching the coveralls.
A crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the
crash site. Maps are laid out on tables. Power and phone
lines are pulled down from the lines running along the
tracks. Renfro supervises the electronics.
Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and
relays it to Gerard.
POOLE
Blood trail found. Two miles
southwest.
GERARD
(to Biggs)
Type it and match it against all
four prisoners.
(to Renfro)
Renfro, get an I.D. fax on Kimble to
every local hospital.
(to Newman)
Newman...
Newman appears.
NEWMAN
Yes, sir...
GERARD
I need some coffee.
As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING
from the train crash.
ANGLE - TRAIN CRASH
A RESCUE WORKER shouts up to others.
WORKER
Hey, one's alive!
Loading dock outside the E.R. A WORKER stacks boxes of food
outside kitchen entrance. Kimble, in the tow truck
operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside.
Once inside he branches off down a hallway.
An Illinois State Trooper's car pulls up outside.
CUT TO:
CLOTH-COVERED INSTRUMENT TRAY
On it we see: A packaged sterilized bandage, an opened
antiseptic wash, an opened topical anesthetic, and an empty
syringe. We PULL BACK to find:
KIMBLE
His wound bathed in orange antiseptic wash, three stitches
already in. With pair of forceps he picks up the needle as
he sutures himself.
CUT TO:
Two PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney. The
lead wheels are stuck.
KIMBLE
Here...
Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney
comes free.
PARAMEDIC #2
Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out
from under a train.
As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face
of the Young Guard. The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide.
YOUNG GUARD
It's him... It's -
Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young
Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there.
KIMBLE
How is he?
The Paramedics move him toward the ramp.
PARAMEDIC #1
He's pretty bad off. Broken leg,
ribs. Concussion.
As Kimble moves away...
KIMBLE
Tell the E.R. doctor he's also got
a perforated spleen.
He's gone... The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk
the Young Guard inside.
PARAMEDIC #2
(impressed)
Jesus, how could he tell that from
looking at his face?
ANGLE - AMBULANCE
Kimble climbs behind the wheel.
A full communications link is in place.
Deputy marshals answer phones, work faxes, add information
to a situation board. Troopers bring in information. Poole
calls Gerard.
POOLE
Background just came in from
Chicago.
GERARD
Hit me.
Renfro and Poole lay out the details. The download of
information comes clear and fast.
RENFRO
Richard David Kimble. Vascular
Surgeon. Convicted of first-degree
murder in the killing of his wife.
Pleaded innocent. Claimed a
one-armed -
GERARD
Let's not retry the case. Priors
and accomplices?
Gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the
investigation to take a leak. Followed by Renfro and Poole.
RENFRO
None. No previous arrests.
Poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as Gerard
unzips his fly and relieves himself.
GERARD
Sealed juvie record?
Poole calls out from behind tree.
POOLE
Nothing. Total cherry.
GERARD
Relatives? Children?
RENFRO
No relatives.
POOLE
One child. A son. Died in drowning
accident three years ago.
GERARD
Girl friends? Ex-wives? Friends?
Combinations of the above?
POOLE
Lot of friends. Doctors. Hospital
staff.
Gerard zips up.
GERARD
Start there. Authorize taps. Cover
his lawyer first.
RENFRO
Never get it.
GERARD
Bet me.
Renfro won't take it.
GERARD
Have Stevens go to Judge Rubin,
he'll sign 'em.
... Biggs charges up the hillside.
BIGGS
DeLange Hospital. Wounded guard
swears to High Holy he saw Kimble
right there in the hallway.
Ambulance, missing too.
ANGLE - SITUATION TENT
Gerard moves quickly to the map.
GERARD
Give me a time.
BIGGS
O-nine-thirty. Twenty minutes ago.
Gerard redraws the circle of units. No longer are we
covering a fifty-mile radius. The circle is redrawn,
tightened, with the hospital as its center. The
triangulation is set.
CUT TO:
The ambulance follows three cars toward a rural railroad
crossing.
COP (V.O.)
... We're waiting up here in Canton.
Wondering if you heard anything on
this Kimble chase -
Poole hangs up phone.
POOLE
Ambulance just spotted two miles
west of Doverville. Heading north
on State road 53.
Renfro turns to the map and marks it. The circle is much
smaller.
RENFRO
Running outta map, Sam.
The crash site and hospital are already marked. Gerard is
ready to move.
GERARD
Just the way we want it. Okay,
people, let's button up.
They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter.
... The ambulance crests a hill. In the distance we see the
Grosvner Viaduct and the Barkley Dam.
Blowing other traffic off the road, WHOOPING CRUISERS and
G-cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of
Southern Illinois. Overtaking them all, a CHOPPER THUNDERS
overhead.
The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel. Three hundred
feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River.
The Barkley Dam rises ahead. Kimble's AMBULANCE ROARS into
the tunnel.
ON KIMBLE
Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at
the mouth of the tunnel.
Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat.
ANGLE - FAR END OF TUNNEL (BEHIND HIM)
Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far
entrance. Light flares. Set out road blocks.
ANGLE HELICOPTER
Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole.
KIMBLE'S AMBULANCE
Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions.
Immediately HORNS begin BLARING.
Trooper pulls up. Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking
the other end.
Troopers with guns drawn block the exits. The P.A. from a
State patrol car blares:
P.A. (V.O.)
Please remain in your vehicles and
lock your doors. Repeat, please
remain in -
ANGLE ON HELICOPTER
Poole and Renfro materialize already decked out in Kevlar.
They're jacked up and ready to rock. Renfro hands Gerard a
vest.
RENFRO
Got him.
Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22.
GERARD
Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard
part's over.
He starts into the tunnel.
RENFRO
(to radio)
We're movin' in.
Biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees Kimble leap
into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into
the mists below. He can't believe his eyes.
Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam
near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search
helicopter converge on the site.
Far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend.
The snag - a tree branch - breaks away and heads down
stream. Hanging onto the branch we see Kimble.
Below the dam and spillway. Troopers in waders search the
shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore.
Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters.
FROM SHORE
Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with
the next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD
ILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.
HEAD TROOPER
Running out of daylight, Inspector.
GERARD
Lights and generators are coming,
Captain.
HEAD TROOPER
Look, I don't mean to tell you your
job, but maybe one person in a
million could've survived that fall.
The guy's fish food.
Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain.
GERARD
Then find me the fish that ate him.
He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter.
Kimble runs through the woods. He staggers, his arm hooks a
sapling which spins him to the ground. He lays motionless,
exhausted.
Helen running down beach TOWARD us. Embraces Kimble as we -
DISSOLVE TO:
Helen's head comes up out of a pool. Hair tossed back, she
smiles as we -
DISSOLVE TO:
Kimble comes out of his sleep with a start. Shivering. He
remembers where he is. His breathing returns to normal.
Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into
tunnel.
A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a
new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat,
moves down the road to the diner.
Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until
he's out of sight of the diner. Once free of the lights of
the diner he starts running and disappears into the night.
Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both
sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly
hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves
faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to
a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the
inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him
chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble
looks at himself. He's shaking.
A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next
to him, passenger window rolls down...
OLDER WAITRESS
Need a ride?
Kimble stares at her.
KIMBLE
Which way are you going?
She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling.
They hold a look as we hear:
RENFRO (V.O.)
We feel confident about the I.D.
CUT TO:
A quiet house on a quiet street out from town. A homeless
woman picks through garbage. A garbage truck moves slowly
down the street. A plumbing truck parked along a curb. Just
early morning traffic.
We see Renfro and Newman watch the house from across the
street, behind a deserted house. Gerard joins them. We see
that Biggs is in the plumbing truck. Poole is the homeless
woman picking through the garbage. Newman hands Gerard a
radio.
RENFRO
Local officials were about to wet
their pants to move in.
GERARD
I bet they were.
(to radio)
Where's the woman?
INTERCUT WITH:
BIGGS
In the plumbing truck. He triggers his mike.
RENFRO
(into radio)
Same room.
GERARD
(into radio)
Okay... I'll take front. Biggs and
Renfro, rear. Poole, handle support.
I don't want anyone hurt. Stay
outside unless called. Radios on
three.
The deputies prepare their weapons. Newman checks his
service issue .38, stares at Gerard's Glock.
NEWMAN
Uh, just want me to wait here, sir?
GERARD
Hell, no. You're with me, Newman.
Let's go.
DOOR CRASHES open, splintering the deadbolt right out of
the door.
GERARD
U.S. Marshals. Down! Down!
As coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across
the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a
sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly
hysterical, clutching his ear.
NEWMAN
My ear... I can't hear a thing out
of it. I can't believe you did that!
GERARD
You think I should have bargained
with him, don't you?
NEWMAN
Yes. You could've missed! You
could've killed me!
GERARD
Yeah, you're absolutely right. I
could've.
They hold a look.
GERARD
How bad's your ear?
NEWMAN
Terrible. I probably have permanent
hearing damage.
GERARD
Let me see it.
Newman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.
GERARD
I don't bargain.
Gerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly
unsettling man Gerard is.
Kimble makes call. While he waits for phone to be answered
TRAINS COME and GO in the b.g. An EL CROSSES OVERHEAD. The
BELLS of Chicago River DRAWBRIDGE.
KIMBLE
Walter. It's Richard.
INTERCUT WITH:
Kimble stands in the doorway with cup of coffee. He considers
his next move. Then seeing bank clock flash the time: 9:30 -
he knows what that move is.
Dr. Nichols leaves the club. He tosses his gym bag into the
back of his car and drives off.
As he pulls up to the first stoplight, a homeless man moves
toward the driver's side and begins washing his windshield.
Nichols waves the man off.
NICHOLS
Not today, please.
The man shuffles off. Just then a second man appears at his
passenger window. He leans down to wave him away
NICHOLS
No. Not -
... then stops - the face at his passenger window is
Richard Kimble's.
NICHOLS
(stunned)
Oh, my God... Richard...
Nichols rolls down the passenger window.
KIMBLE
How're you doing, Charlie?
NICHOLS
You're alive...
KIMBLE
Yeah. And I need your help.
NICHOLS
Anything.
KIMBLE
I need some money. Whatever you've
got on you.
NICHOLS
Of course.
Nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs
for his wallet...
NICHOLS
Tell me where you're staying. I'll
get you more money. Some clothes.
Just give me an address...
KIMBLE
I'll call you.
Kimble glances around, the area is still clear. He looks
back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the
corner and come up the street behind them.
Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to
Kimble, who quickly pockets it.
NICHOLS
I know why you came back - to find
him. If I can help, call me...
Call me.
They hold a look. The stoplight changes to green but they
don't see it.
KIMBLE
Thanks, Charlie...
NICHOLS
Here, Richard, take my coat...
He reaches into the back for his coat, suddenly police car
behind him POPS its SIREN. Nichols looks into his rearview
mirror. Sees a COP lean out his window.
COP
(to Nichols)
Hey, buddy - green light. Let's go.
Nichols looks back at Kimble. He's gone.
Holding a handkerchief to his face, Kimble moves through
arriving patients and enters Cook County Hospital.
Police patrol the platform looking for Kimble.
Kimble knocks at door. It is opened to reveal a PUNK KID,
18-20. He calls to someone O.S.
CUT TO:
Gerard and his deputies leave Nichols' outer office.
Gerard clearly feels he's come to the right man.
GERARD
Stay on him.
A car door slams. We see unmarked police cars pulling up in
front of the apartment. Cops are moving toward the house.
Kimble leaves Prosthetic Clinic and starts down the hall
for the exit when a voice stops him.
ANNE (O.S.)
Do you have a particular interest in
our patients' x-rays?
Kimble turns to see Anne coming toward him.
KIMBLE
What do you mean?
ANNE
I saw you looking at that boy's
chest film.
She moves in on him. He eyes the exit.
KIMBLE
It's a hobby of mine -
ANNE
What other hobbies do you have?
Brain surgery?
KIMBLE
What do you want?
She reaches him.
ANNE
I want to know how that kid ended
up in surgery.
KIMBLE
I'm a janitor. I did what I was
told.
ANNE
Bullshit. Who changed those orders?
They hold a look. She knows. He takes a step back and she
pulls his I.D.
ANNE
You stand right here. I'm calling
security.
Kimble runs. Anne turns to call security but doesn't.
She stares after Kimble.
CUT TO:
Kimble stands on a sidewalk, staring at the imposing edifice
across the street. After a here-we-go breath, he starts
through traffic.
... and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like
in a bear trap, as the door locks down. Harrowed, Kimble looks
back over his shoulder at...
Gerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and
clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim.
GERARD
Kimble. Stop!
It's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his
leg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as
Kimble leaves a cheap hotel early the next morning. He wears
a new set of clothes - jeans, sport coat and tie - than the
day before, and the black hair coloring has been rinsed from
his hair. He moves down the street.
Kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind
Sykes' apartment. He looks in the window, steps back to see
if anyone is looking, then pulls his fist back into his
sleeve and with one swift pop, BREAKS the GLASS.
The two cops receive a radio report about Kimble and
quickly exit their car. They rush toward Sykes' building.
ANGLE - BACK ALLEY
While they move into the apartment, we see Kimble, fully
aware of them, slip away down the alley.
Fredrick Sykes, the one-armed man, comes down the side
walk. He passes a car and hears the door open behind him.
Biggs climbs out of the car and falls into step behind him.
Sykes hears the footsteps but moves on up the stoop and
starts to enter his apartment, notices the front door
already open.
Cops and Marshals in his house. Processing a crime scene.
SYKES
What the hell's going on here?
Who are you people?
He steps...
Gerard crosses the street with Renfro and Biggs.
RENFRO
He's pulling our chain, Sam. If this
was the guy Kimble was looking for,
why call us?
GERARD
Kimble said he's putting together a
puzzle. We don't need to put it
together too, we just need to be
there when he gets to the next
piece.
Gerard stops and looks back at Sykes' apartment.
GERARD
Keep somebody on him. If he moves
I want to know.
CUT TO:
Kimble answers a pay PHONE when it RINGS.
KIMBLE
(urgent)
Can you talk?

Kimble enters the hospital through the loading dock.
The cop stares at Sykes' window when suddenly we hear FIRE
SIRENS, and a pair of fire trucks turn onto the street and
pull up across the street from the unmarked car -blocking
the view of Sykes' house. Firemen climb down and move to a
nearby building. The street begins to fill up with people.
The cop stares at the commotion directly behind him. He
becomes so engrossed in the action like everyone else that
he fails to see Sykes, using the distraction, exit his
apartment and walk calmly away from the scene.
Sykes stands at a phone booth, finishes a call, then moves
up the stairs to board an el train.
Newman and Biggs enter the hospital.
Kimble exits the hospital and moves toward Hospital E1 Station.
Kimble starts up the stairs to the station just as a train
is coming in. Kimble moves down the platform and boards the
downtown train. Just before the doors close Sykes steps onto
the last car. The train moves out.
CUT TO:
The brakes lock. The TRAIN SCREECHES.
The train stops just short of the station. Only the first
two windows of the front car are over the platform.
... drops to the station platform. Kimble lowers his head and
moves down the uncrowded platform to the station.
Police cruisers pull outside the station.
Gerard's car pulls up in front of the hotel. Police are
controlling pedestrians. Newman and Biggs, already decked
out in Kevlar, meet him.
NEWMAN
C.P.D. just reported -
GERARD
I heard. Was it Kimble?
BIGGS
Conflicting reports, but the cops
are considering him a shooter.
Heavily-armed CPD units pull up. Gerard stares at the police
presence. He starts toward the hotel where Kelly is
conferring with Kevlar-decked police captain.
POLICE CAPTAIN
Witnesses say he entered hotel from
the subway.
KELLY
Okay. I want it locked down. Start
on the lower levels.
The captain moves off. Gerard intercepts the cop.
GERARD
That's my man in there, Kelly.
KELLY
Not since he took down one of ours,
Gerard. This is a police matter,
now. Stay, the hell, out of it.
Kelly moves off. Gerard watches him a moment then he looks
up to the roof. Newman hands Gerard his belt with his
backup piece.
GERARD
C'mon, I know where he's going.
He moves into the hotel with his deputies.
INTERCUT WITH:
A) C.P.D. cruisers arriving. Cops deploying to points of
entry. Security guards keying shut parking garage and
blocking stairwells.
B) Helicopter with police sharpshooters takes off from
Meigs Field downtown and heads for the hotel.
CUT TO:
ROARING over Chicago skyline. The bright red sign of the
Hilton Hotel looms ahead.
CUT TO:
... and almost over the railing. Kimble grabs the rail to
keep from dropping to the street. Nichols closes on him,
but Kimble rolls away at the last minute and knocks
Nichols back against the other side of fire escape.
KIMBLE
You missed your chance, Charlie...
Nichols charges Kimble, but Kimble drives him back with
two crushing blows that send Nichols down the stairs.
Kimble moves down the stairs after him - passing under a
security camera.
CUT TO:
Nichols rises to his feet, swings, but Kimble blocks the
blow and lands another that sends Nichols down another
set of stairs to the roof.
KIMBLE
You took everything away from me...
for money.
Kimble pulls Nichols to his feet. They are silhouetted by
the lights of the city skyline.
KIMBLE
I want to know, Charlie... was it
worth it...?
NICHOLS
This thing is bigger than even you
think, Richard. You can't stop it.
He hits Nichols again with tremendous force, knocking him
against the parapet. Nichols stares over the edge - the
street appears far below.
Kimble reaches Nichols and draws to hit him again as the
HELICOPTER suddenly ROARS over the rooftop. Its beam hits
the two men and a VOICE booms from the helicopter:
VOICE FROM HELICOPTER (V.O.)
Chicago police. Freeze.
In the instant of shock, Nichols knees Kimble and bolts.
INTERCUT:
Nichols runs.
Kimble recovers, sees Gerard moving down the fire escape
toward him, and Nichols escaping. He goes after Nichols.
The helicopter circles back over the roof, illuminating the
rooftop in its million-candle-power beam.
HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)
I've got a visual on Kimble. He's
running.
INTERCUT WITH:
Kelly listens on his ratio.
KELLY
Bring him down.
Kimble chases Nichols down the roof as BULLETS from the
helicopter rip into the air conditioning duct next to Kimble.
The helicopter swings out to keep Kimble in sight.
ON GERARD
Gerard hits the bottom of the fire escape and follows.
GERARD
(to radio)
This is a United States Marshal.
Get that helicopter out of here!
ANGLE - NICHOLS
He moves away among the duct work.
Kimble follows.
Gerard continues after Kimble.
The helicopter circles and follows from above.
Gerard rushes across the roof toward Kimble.
ANGLE - NICHOLS
He is almost to the end of the roof when Kimble tackles
him. The two men crash against sloped glass roof of an
elevator housing.
Charges toward -
KIMBLE
Who slams Nichols hard against the glass. The WIRED
GLASS CRACKS and bellies with the form of their bodies.
Nichols' head rocks from the impact.
The GLASS GROANS. The wire stresses. The caulking begins
to drop.
Nichols struggles but Kimble has him in control. Slams
him down hard again.
HELICOPTER
Circles, illuminates the struggle in its spotlight and
Gerard closing.
Gerard reaches the elevator housing, looks down into the
shaft.
GERARD'S POV
Kimble's car disappears into the darkness.
CUT TO:
Chicago Police hold back crowds of onlookers on Michigan
Avenue. Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie
for space in front of the Hilton Towers.
Dr. Charles Nichols, on a stretcher, loaded into an
ambulance. The doors close.
REPORTERS and television cameramen line the sidewalk
giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom.
We PICK UP pieces of their reports as we MOVE PAST them
TOWARD the entrance.
T.V. NEWS REPORTER
... As we reported a few minutes
ago, the saga of once-prominent
Chicago surgeon, Dr. Richard Kimble,
who escaped from an Illinois
Corrections bus, took a strange
twist this evening when Dr. Kimble
was captured at the Chicago Hilton...
ANOTHER REPORTER continues:
ANOTHER REPORTER
... there are unconfirmed reports
from police of new evidence which
may exonerate Kimble while
implicating some of the biggest
names in medicine...
The doors to the police van close amid a flurry of
photographs.
A third reporter interviews a STUNNED DOCTOR from the
ballroom:
STUNNED DOCTOR
He just walked in... We didn't know
what he was going to do. My wife
was very frightened... The next
thing I knew cops were charging in
and...
CUT TO:
As soon as the group exits the hotel. Television lights
flood the scene. Kimble lowers his head. Reporters crowd
forward, yelling questions.
REPORTER
Dr. Kimble, is it true you can prove
your innocence!
Gerard wants the crowd controlled.
GERARD
(to police)
Get them back.
The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into
a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back
door and helps Kimble inside.
BIGGS
Watch your head, Dr. Kimble.
Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next
to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole.
GERARD
(to Poole)
Poole, you got that thing?
(to Kimble)
Give me your hands.
Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks
Kimble's handcuffs.
Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat. Gerard places the
pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands.
GERARD
Take care of those hands, Doc,
you're going to need them again
soon.
KIMBLE
I thought you told me 'you didn't
care.'
GERARD
Yeah, well, don't spread it around.
They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away.
HELICOPTER POV
The car carrying Kimble pulls onto Michigan Avenue heading
back downtown. As we PULL BACK we see Kimble's car - at
first alone on the great avenue - then gradually joined
by other cars until finally becoming integrated in the
traffic, movement and lights of the city.
