THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT
A dirty bar hidden away on a dark street, its cracked, moon-
white sign the only evidence it exists.
Corky's truck swings into a space in front of a couple of
large motorcycles.
She flips her collar and heads for the
door.
CITY STREET - NIGHT
The neighborhood would be politely described as "rough."
Corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered
street.
It is late, the area burnished with amber street light.
Corky walks from the building to her truck.
She climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition, when
suddenly the passenger door opens and --
Violet gets in.
Stunned, Corky stares at her.
VIOLET
I had to see you.
CORKY
Look, I don't think this is a good
idea.
VIOLET
I wanted to apologize.
CORKY
Don't apologize, please.
I can't
stand women who apologize for wanting
sex.
Violet smiles.
VIOLET
I'm not apologizing for what I did --
She slides across the seat.
VIOLET
I'm apologizing for what I didn't
do.
She kisses Corky, and if Corky is trying to resist, we can't
tell.
The windshield is beginning to steam when Violet, panting,
breaks the kiss.
VIOLET
Do you have a bed somewhere?
Unable to speak, Corky reaches over and starts the engine.
Corky gets out of her truck carrying her tools.
Grinning
like someone who has been well-laid, she whistles off to
work.
Between the main doors she sees a man.
His name is SHELLY
and he is an overdressed accountant.
He is very nervous, talking to someone through the intercom.
SHELLY
I know he's gone.
Please.
I have
to talk to you.
Fiddling with her keys, Corky recognizes the voice that
answers him.
VIOLET (V.O.)
What do you want, Shelly?
Shelly glances over his shoulder at Corky, answering in a
hushed voice.
SHELLY
I have to leave.
Tonight.
For a moment the intercom is silent.
Then the door buzzes
and Shelly pushes inside.
Corky follows him to the elevator.
CAESAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
A green-and-white street sign juts in the foreground of
Caesar's upscale apartment building.
The sign reads: "FRANKLIN STREET."
PARKING LOT - DAY
The rusty Chevy glides to a stop in a parking space near the
service entrance.
In its payload is a boxed bathroom vanity
and sink.
Corky climbs out of the cab and into the back, unhooking the
bungee cords that hold down the boxes.
She looks up as a black Lincoln Town Car screeches into a
spot not far from her truck.
THREE SERIOUS-LOOKING MEN get
out, leading a fourth, Shelly.
He is the only one who seems to notice Corky.
They enter the building, the door closing behind them.
ALLEY - NIGHT
Corky's truck sits in a gravel parking lot.
PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Through the window they see a squad car, lights blaring,
roll up in front of the building.
PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Caesar is on his knees, searching under the seats of Johnnie's
Mercedes.
Unable to find the money, he is ready to snap.
From the main doors, Corky slips out of the building.
Hiding
behind a column, she sees Violet and Caesar across the lot.
Corky moves behind the parked cars, the gun squeezed in her
hand.
Violet edges away, on the verge of running, looking toward
the busy street.
Standing, Caesar pounds on the car.
CAESAR
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
VIOLET
Caesar, someone could see us out
here.
Ignoring her, be tries to think.
CAESAR
Get in.
Still too far from them to do anytbing, Corky sees Caesar
slam the trunk.
CAESAR
Get in!
It's got to be at his house.
That's the only other place it could
be.
Violet looks around the lot, looking for some way out.
CAESAR
Violet!
Now!
Corky can only watch as Violet gets in and the car rips away.
JOHNNIE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
The BMW is parked in front.
PARKING LOT - DAY
Mickey is standing with Violet, next to his Lincoln Town
Car.
VIOLET
I will never understand it, Mickey.
You didn't even call the police.
MICKEY
I told you, the family doesn't want
the police around.
We want to take
care of it ourselves and we will.
I'll find him.
I swear I will.
VIOLET
I know you will.
MICKEY
Sure you're going to be okay?
I
mean, if you're having second
thoughts, my offer still stands.
VIOLET
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get
out, you know?
Get away from all of
this.
Mickey nods.
VIOLET
But thanks.
Thanks for everything.
She hugs him and he kisses her.
Then he gets in his car.
Violet watches him drive away and knows that she is free.
CORKY'S APARTMENT
Corky sitting on stoop, patient, like a rock.
She looks up as she hears high heels, and smiles at --
Violet standing there, new outfit.
Corky stands in front of her.
CORKY
Hey.
VIOLET
Hey.
CORKY
How'd it go?
VIOLET
I'm here, aren't I?
Corky nods.
CORKY
I guess we should get out of here.
Violet nods.
Corky digs out alarm keys, aims, fires.
Violet turns, looks.
New truck.
Violet turns to Corky, eyebrow cocked.
CORKY
Thought we might need a getaway car.
Smiles, they get in.
