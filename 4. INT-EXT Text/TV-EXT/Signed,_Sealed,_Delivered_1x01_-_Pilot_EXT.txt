      We see the sights of Denver - the mountains, the skyline,
      the lake in Washington Park...


      We DRIVE down a pleasant local shopping area, passing
      boutiques, a U.S. Mail truck is parked nearby.  A MAIL CARRIER
      steps out to deliver a box to a florist shop.  WE PASS the
      truck and continue down the street, stopping at a Starbuck's. 
      In front of the Starbuck's, on the corner, stands one of the
      last remaining U.S. Mailboxes in the area.


      Along the window, facing towards the street, is a ROW OF
        TWENTY-SOMETHINGS sitting at a long counter staring - not
      out the window - but at their laptops and iPads.

      THE CAMERA PUSHES IN THROUGH THE WINDOW

      We HEAR a MALE VOICE.

                                    MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                    Look at them. Guzzling their pumpkin-
                    flavored coffee, tapping away on
                    their laptops...


      Oliver strolls down the street carrying his cup of coffee.
      He walks like a man who enjoys being alive, appreciating the
      things around him: the blue sky, the flowers in the planters
      on the sidewalk, the mailbox ahead on the corner.

                                      OLIVER (V.O.)
                    There it is, the last bastion of
                    civility in a world of megabytes
                    and downloads, a beacon of hope to
                    those who still put their faith in
                    the power of a piece of paper and
                      a forty-six cent stamp.

      A woman walks up to the mailbox.  Oliver gallantly holds the
      shoot open for her.  She smiles and drops her letter inside
      and walks off.  He looks at the mailbox fondly as he sips
      his coffee.

                                      OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Behind every envelope stand
                    thousands of dedicated heroes who
                    still fight the good fight through
                    rain and snow and fiscal cliffs to
                    deliver every note, every card,
                    every letter.  And I am one of
                    them, the few, the proud, the
                    postal. I work for you, whoever
                    you are.  Or, whoever...you were.                                                                                        5.

      ANGLE ON THE MAILBOX

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      CLOSE ON two small hanging mailboxes marked with an A or B  
      between a blue door and a brown door. 

      ANGLE ON THE STREET

      A taxicab pulls up to the curb in front of the brick duplex 
      in the middle class neighborhood.

      ANGLE ON PASSENGER SEAT

      KELLY, a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties, looks at
      the blue door and smiles sadly.

      KELLY'S POV

      The house number above the blue door: 1020.

      Kelly writes the address on a STAMPED PINK ENVELOPE.

                                      KELLY
                    Okay, thanks.  Just one more stop
                    now before the station, please.


      The impatient taxi DRIVER HONKS from the taxicab. 

                                      DRIVER
                    Lady, are you coming or not?

      Kelly stands in front of a mailbox on a street corner.  She
      holds the pink envelope in one hand and the open slot with
      the other hand, debating whether or not to mail the letter. 
      She puts it in, takes it out, thinks it over.

                                      DRIVER (CONT'D)
                    Decide already!

                                      KELLY
                    I'm sorry, I just...

                                      DRIVER
                    "When in doubt, don't."  My mother
                    always said that and she was no
                    dummy.

      That seems to make some sense to Kelly.  She stuffs the letter
      in her pocket, walks back to the cab and gets in.  They drive
      off.                                                                                         6.


      The taxi pulls up to the curb.  Our Taxi Driver, now somewhat
      kinder and gentler, gets out and retrieves Kelly's luggage
      as she exits the taxi.  He gives her a genuine, sympathetic
      smile.

                                      DRIVER
                    Here you go, kid. 

                                      KELLY
                    Thanks.

      She starts to pay him.  The Driver stops her.

                                      DRIVER
                    No.  You keep it.

                                      KELLY
                    But...

                                      DRIVER
                    Honest.  I hear a lot of stories
                    come outta that backseat, but yours
                    is a doozie. 

                                      KELLY
                    I haven't told anybody.  I can't
                    believe I told you.

                                      DRIVER
                    Hey, comes with the territory. 
                    I'm kinda like a therapist with
                    six cylinders!

      She laughs and reaches for her luggage.

                                      DRIVER (CONT'D)
                    Don't worry, honey. You're doing
                    the right thing. And mail that
                    letter.  Life is short.

      Something he says resonates with her.  She smiles as if
      recalling a memory.

                                      KELLY
                    I know.
                          (hands him the envelope)
                    I'm so late.  Could you....?

                                      DRIVER
                    No problem.  All part of the
                    service. Take care of yourself,
                    kid.                                                                                         7.

      She smiles and walks into the station.  The Taxi Driver turns
      back to the taxi about to close the trunk.

                                    MALE TRAVELER (O.S.)
                    Taxi!  Hey!

      He stops and turns to see an arriving COUPLE approach with
      luggage.

                                    MALE TRAVELER (CONT'D)
                    We're going to the Drake.

                                      DRIVER
                    Get in.  I've got that.

      He reaches for the luggage, dropping the envelope into the
      side pocket of his jacket.  Except he misses and, unbeknownst
      to him, the PINK ENVELOPE falls onto the pavement.

      The driver drops the bags in the back, slams the trunk, gets
      in the car and drives away, revealing a kiosk where two
      election posters are plastered, one to re-elect Barack Obama
      and one for Mitt Romney.   We realize we are in 2012. The
      CAMERA PANS BACK to THE PINK ENVELOPE.  It lies on the
      pavement.

      Seconds later, the WHEELS of a car drive over it and then we
      see the FEET of a MOTHER and a LITTLE BOY walk past it.  The
      Boy turns around and we WIDEN to see him pick up the damaged
      envelope.

                                      MOTHER
                    What are you doing?  Hurry up!

                                      LITTLE BOY
                    Somebody dropped this. 

                                      MOTHER
                    Give it to me. We'll mail it when
                    we get to Aunt Dody's.

      She takes it and slips it into her purse.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      A taxi with a Texas license plate pulls up in front of a
      ranchhouse where AUNT DODY and her TWO PRE-SCHOOL AGED
      CHILDREN and a BARKING PUPPY are waiting to greet the Mother
      and Little Boy from Denver as they emerge from the taxi. 

                                    DODY
                    Welcome to Texas!                                                                                        8.

      The Mother puts down her purse to embrace Dody, the puppy
      barks & children scream excitedly.  They ad lib greetings.

                                      MOTHER
                    Finally!  What a trip!

      The smallest child, a LITTLE GIRL all dressed in pink, toddles
      up to the purse on the ground and, unnoticed by anyone,
      retrieves the PINK ENVELOPE.

                                      LITTLE GIRL
                    Pink!  Pink!

      She runs around the lawn and up to the porch.


      We see Aunt Dody at the sidewalk drive carrying the PINK
      ENVELOPE, but the name and address are incomprehensibly
      smudged.  She inserts it into the mailbox and lifts the
      "outgoing" flag.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      We are outside a very tall office building.

                                      KELLY (V.O.)
                    "I'm really sick, Charlie, and for
                    the longest time, all I've been
                    thinking about is just trying to
                    stay alive."


      Walking into the building at a rapid pace is CHARLIE, a good-
      looking twenty-something loaded up with a large donut box                                                                                      24.

      and a carrier full of coffee.  He is in his shirt sleeves, a
      tie, and business slacks.  He enters the building. 

      The CAMERA PANS UP to the third floor and we see a beautiful
      young woman, KELLY, standing at the window looking out,
      pensive and conflicted.  She carries a professional camera
      and she takes a photo through the window of something down
      on the sidewalk.


      They exit together.  Charlie throws his hands up in the air
      as if just released from prison.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Free at last, free at last!

                                      KELLY
                    Was it really that bad?

                                      CHARLIE
                    It was so bad that I told myself
                    this morning if a beautiful girl
                    doesn't walk into this elevator
                    today and rescue me, I'm riding
                    all the way up to the top floor
                    and jumping off.  Donuts, coffee,
                    and all.

      Kelly deflects the compliment.

                                      KELLY
                    Columbian coffee, I hope!

                                      CHARLIE
                    "Yessir!"

                                      KELLY
                    Well, congratulations.  I hope you
                    find another job that you like.

                                      CHARLIE
                    That's tomorrow. But today, I'm
                    taking you out for a bagel.

                                      KELLY
                    Oh, I don't know...

                                      CHARLIE
                    You gotta go to work, right?

                                      KELLY
                    No, but...                                                                                      29.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Then come on!  You just saved a
                    man's life.  In some cultures that
                    makes me responsible for you.

                                      KELLY
                    Actually I think it's the other
                    way around.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Even better!  How can you say "no"
                    now?

                                      KELLY
                    But I didn't save your life.  It
                      takes...it takes a lot more than
                    that to save a life.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Are you kidding?  If it weren't
                    for you, I'd be up there right now
                    passing out crullers to Miller,
                    Miller, Miller & Schwartz.  Well,
                    not Schwartz.  He's glucose
                      intolerant.

      END FLASHBACK


      They are finishing off their bagels, tossing the paper into
      a nearby trash.  Charlie is reviewing their agreement.

                                      CHARLIE
                    So, no last names.

                                      KELLY
                    Right.

                                      CHARLIE
                    No phone numbers, no addresses, no
                    "I was born here and I went to
                    school there, my boyfriend is a
                    jerk, my girlfriend married my
                      dentist...." No histories.

                                      KELLY
                    We spend one day together, say
                    whatever we want to say with no
                    fear, no judgment, because we won't
                    see each other again. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    See, that's the part I'm having
                    trouble with.

                                      KELLY
                    Think about it.  One day when you
                    don't have to worry if what you do
                    or say will affect tomorrow.  No
                    phone numbers, no texting, no
                    tweeting, no googling tomorrow. 
                    Just living right now, today.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Is this part of your "life is short
                      philosophy?"  Are you writing a
                    book and I'm one of your
                      unsuspecting subjects?  "Chapter
                    14 - Charlie Quits His Job...."

                                      KELLY
                      Philosophy, yes.  Book, no.   Are
                    you in or out?


      Oliver, Shane, Norman, and Rita stand in the park, near the
      bicycle racks.  Rita has gotten a bit of a second wind.

                    "I know I gave you a pretty crazy
                    reason for only spending one day
                    together, Charlie...."

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      BEGIN FLASHBACK - 2012


      Kelly and Charlie are in a beautiful park renting bikes from
      a machine.  Kelly wears her backpack and straddles a bike,
      ready to ride.  Joggers run by, people walk dogs, play
      Frisbee, etc. Kelly is taking pictures of everything.

                                      KELLY (V.O.)
                    "The truth is, I only had one day
                    to spend....                                                                                      41.

      Charlie swipes his credit card to release a second bike and
      puts the card in his wallet and his wallet in his back pocket. 
      He gets on the bike, she puts her camera in her backpack and
      they push off.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    But spending it with you made all
                    the difference."

      BEGIN MONTAGE


      Kelly and Charlie ride along the bike path, past gardens, a
      playground, a fountain.  Kelly takes photos, wobbles on her
      bikes, Charlie steadies it as she shoots.


      They have stopped by the lake, where ducks have gathered. 
      Kelly takes a few photos as Charlie pulls something out of
      his backpack, starts tearing it apart, and tossing it to the
      ravenous ducks.

                                      CHARLIE
                      Lunchtime, guys.
                          (hands some to Kelly)
                    Here.

                                      KELLY
                    What's this?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Cameron's cinnamon cruller.  I was
                    going to eat it as a last act of
                    defiance, but now I like the thought
                    of feeding it to wild ducks, one
                    tiny piece at a time.

      Kelly laughs.

                                      KELLY
                    I'm glad to see you're not bitter.

                                      CHARLIE
                    You know, I'm not, actually.  Just
                    think, that poor guy's still back
                    there, merging and acquiring and
                      I'm....well, I'm here with you.

      They share a quiet look.  A good time to kiss, but Kelly
      breaks the spell and tosses another crumb to the ducks. 
      Charlie sees something in the distance.                                                                                      42.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    C'mon.  I want to show you
                      something.


      Charlie and Kelly are standing on a bridge that spans a ditch. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    When I was in sixth grade, I walked
                    to school and I crossed this bridge
                    every day.

                                      KELLY
                    Careful.  No historical details.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I know, I know.  But see this ditch? 
                    All the other kids jumped the ditch
                    on the way to school.  They'd take
                    a running start and fly right across
                    and land over there.

                                      KELLY
                    But you took the bridge.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I tried to jump at first.  I'd run
                    right up to the edge but something
                    always made me put on the brakes
                    at the last second.  God, it was
                      embarrassing.  They'd all be
                    standing on the other side yelling
                    "Jump, Charlie.  You can do it!"

                                      KELLY
                    But...?

                                      CHARLIE
                    But I never did.  After awhile,
                    they stopped expecting me to even
                    try and then it was too late to
                    change their minds.

      Kelly is quiet.  Something he has said has resonated deeply.

                                      KELLY
                    Maybe some things are just too
                    late to fix.

      Charlie senses he's hit a nerve and breaks the mood.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Shoot, what do I know? It's never
                    too late.                                                                                      43.

                                      KELLY
                          (smiles)
                    Oh yeah?  Then jump the ditch.

                                      CHARLIE
                    What?

                                      KELLY
                    Jump! Do it today.  What are you
                    waiting for?

                                      CHARLIE
                    No way.

                                      KELLY
                          (laughing)
                    Ditch your pride.

                                      CHARLIE
                    "Ditch."  Very clever.  Okay, go
                    over there and wait.  But over to
                    the side.  Don't distract me.

                                      KELLY
                          (amused)
                    Right.

                                      CHARLIE
                    And no cameras!

                                      KELLY
                    You may want a record of this
                    someday.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Someday?  Aha!  Now if there's a
                    chance we have a "someday," THAT'S
                    worth jumping for. 

      Kelly smiles and walks down the bridge and positions herself
      to the side, near a tree.  Charlie walks a good distance
      away to give himself some running room.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                          (to himself)
                    Okay.  I can do this.

      ANGLE ON KELLY

      She slips her camera out and stands partially covered from
      view, clicking photos.

      CAMERA POV - A SERIES OF SHUTTER CLICKS                                                                                      44.

      We see Charlie, a good distance away, turn around and prepare
      himself.  He stretches.  He takes a breath.  He starts to
      run back towards the ditch.

      He makes it!  Click, Click, Click.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Yes!

      Charlie does a victory dance and runs around a little.
      Suddenly something - some ONE - runs out from a stand of
      trees, smacks into him and knocks him down.

      Kelly stops shooting and looks across. 

      KELLY'S POV - CHARLIE AND A JOGGER

      It all happens very quickly.  Charlie and the jogger are
      both on the ground.  Charlie stands and helps the jogger up. 
      Charlie seems very good-natured, laughing, dusting off the
      jogger, clearly apologizing, patting the guy on the back and
      sending him on his way.  Kelly takes a couple more pictures
      of the encounter, and we see on her face a new sense of
        appreciation for Charlie.

      Charlie walks back towards her, over the bridge. 

                                      KELLY
                    Ouch!  Are you okay?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yeah.  Pride goeth before a fall,
                    I guess.

                                      KELLY
                    You lost a button.

                                      CHARLIE
                    A small sacrifice for making the
                    jump of a lifetime. 

                                      KELLY
                    You were awfully nice to that guy,
                      considering he knocked you down.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Well, why not?  Life is short.

      Kelly looks at him and he grins. 

                                      KELLY (V.O.)
                    I think that was the moment I
                    realized how much I wanted to live.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      45.

                                      KELLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    How much I needed to believe in a
                    "someday" with you in it.  Maybe
                    that's how it feels to fall in
                    love, Charlie. When you can't wait
                    for tomorrow.

      They retrieve their bikes and walk them for awhile. Charlie
      gets on his bike.  Kelly does, too, and follows him.


      They are riding their bikes along the lake and Kelly slows
      down, running out of energy.  She works hard to hide it.

                                      CHARLIE
                          (calling back)
                    There's a great fountain up here
                    at the top.

                                      KELLY
                    Charlie, wait!

      Charlie stops and rides back to her.  Kelly parks her bike
      and sits on a nearby park bench.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    It's so pretty here. I just want
                    to take a couple of pictures.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Go for it.

      Charlie notices a newspaper left by someone on the bench. 
      He picks it up and starts folding it into a boat.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    So, are you a professional
                      photographer?
                          (she gives him a look)
                    Ok, how about this:...why do you
                    like to take pictures?

                                      KELLY
                    Lemme see...well, I know in some
                    cultures people think taking a
                      photograph of something is like
                    stealing a piece of its soul.  But
                    for me, taking a picture of
                    something or someone is a way to 
                    ....I don't know...honor a soul. 
                    It's my way of saying "here you
                    are, duck, here you are, sky, here
                    you are, Charlie, and before you
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      46.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    float away, I want to stop time
                    for just a moment to really see
                    you.

      Charlie doesn't look up.  He just stares at the newspaper
      boat he holds in his hand.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    What?  What are you thinking?

                                      CHARLIE
                    I'm reading this little article
                    here on the side about Rodger Piper,
                    age 61, a baker who won the lottery
                    last week.  And I bet everybody
                    thinks he's the luckiest guy in
                    the world.  And yesterday, I would
                    have thought so, too.  But today,
                    I think the luckiest guy in the
                      world...is me.

      He sets the boat adrift. Kelly takes a photo of the boat. 
      Charlie turns and looks at her and smiles.  She smiles back
      and takes a photo of him.  Click.

                    there is an exact replica of Martha

                                      OLIVER
                    I don't see the purpose in
                      continuing this field trip,
                      particularly without a permission
                    slip from your mother, Norman.                                                                                      47.

                                      SHANE
                    Just a little longer, Oliver. 
                    Please. Just read a little more. 
                    There's got to be something in
                    that letter that can help us if we
                    put ourselves in Kelly and Charlie's
                    place. 

      Oliver sighs and mutters as he finds his place.

                                      OLIVER
                    I will not jump over a ditch.

                                      SHANE
                    Fine. 

                                      OLIVER
                    Tomorrow, everything goes back to
                    normal.

                                      SHANE
                    If that's what you consider normal.

                                      OLIVER
                          (reads)
                    "I wanted to tell you everything
                    right then, Charlie....

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

41BEGIN FLASHBACK 


      As the boat floats off, we hear Kelly's voice continue:

                                      KELLY (V.O.)
                    "...But I didn't want to break the
                    spell.  I've always been good at
                    putting off the hard stuff..."

      Kelly sits beside Charlie as they watch the boat float away.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    I feel like we ought to do
                      something.  Something to commemorate
                    this day.  Something that makes a
                      difference.

                                      CHARLIE
                    We could get married.

                                      KELLY
                    Tempting.  But I don't marry on
                    the first date.                                                                                      48.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Good point.  Let's see....

      He sees something in the distance.  It's a Red Cross
      Bloodmobile set up near a playground.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Got it! You saved my life today. 
                    Let's save some more!

      A shadow comes across Kelly's face.

                                      KELLY
                    You want to give blood?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yeah!  It's life-affirming, you
                    get to lie down, they give you
                    cookies, and it's free!

                                      KELLY
                    I don't give blood
                      really...anymore...

                                      CHARLIE
                    C'mon.  They do it once a year
                    here in the park and it makes you
                    feel great.

                                      KELLY
                    You won't jump a ditch but needles
                    are no problem?

                                      CHARLIE
                    I know. Go figure.  I used to do
                    it all the time in college.  I
                    think I've even got my old donor
                    card here in my...

      He reaches into his back pocket, but realizes it's not there.

                                      KELLY
                    What's the matter?

                                      CHARLIE
                    My wallet. I think I've...oh, man...

      He realizes it's missing.


      They are walking their bikes slowly, retracing their steps,
      looking for his wallet.                                                                                      49.

                                      KELLY
                    I can't believe you lost your wallet
                    and your job on the same day.
                          (leans down to pick
                            something up)
                    Found your button though.

                                      CHARLIE
                    To be accurate, I quit my job, I
                    did lose the wallet, but I found
                    the girl of my dreams.  I think it
                    all balances out.  Except for the
                    part where I wake up tomorrow and
                    realize I lost the girl.

                                      KELLY
                    Charlie, I'm sorry.  It just...it
                    just has to be this way.

      She takes his hand and puts the button in it.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    Promise me you'll go home tonight
                    and you'll sew this button back on
                    your blazer and find yourself the
                    job of your dreams and meet somebody
                    wonderful and have lots of babies
                    and grandchildren and make dozens
                    of paper boats for them every time
                    you take them for walks in the
                    park and when you set them sailing,
                    you'll think of me.

      Charlie looks at the button and gives it back to her.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Or, you could come by tomorrow and
                    sew the button on yourself.

                                      KELLY
                          (laughs)
                    Are you telling me you can't sew?

                                      CHARLIE
                    I don't think I can do anything
                    without you now, Kelly.

      They almost kiss.  Kelly hesitates.  Charlie smiles.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    One more thing.  Just one more.

      He takes her hand and walks her to the nearby swingset.                                                                                      50.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    If you sit in this one right here...

      She does.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    And you swing really high....

      He pushes her again and again...

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    And you look over the top of the
                    trees right over there, you see a
                    brick duplex with a blue door and
                    a brown door?

                                      KELLY
                    No...yes!  A blue door and a
                    chimney?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Right.

      She swings back to him and he stops her.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    That's where I live.  The blue
                    door.

                                      KELLY
                    You're breaking the rule.

                                      CHARLIE
                    You're breaking my heart.  Come
                    on, tell me that I'm going to open
                    my door tomorrow morning and you'll
                    be sitting on the steps.

                                      KELLY
                    Charlie, please, I have to...

      He pushes her higher.  We FOLLOW KELLY up into the air.  As
      the swing comes back down, it's now:

      END FLASHBACK


      SHANE IN THE SWING IS CAUGHT BY OLIVER

      It's a surprisingly intimate moment.  They speak awkwardly.

                                      SHANE
                    ...stop.                                                                                      51.

                                      OLIVER
                    Did you see it?

                                      SHANE
                    Did I...?

                                      OLIVER
                    The blue door.

                                      SHANE
                    Oh, right.  Yes.  That must be
                    Charlie's place.  But, maybe we
                    should read just a little further. 
                    You know, just to be sure.

                                      OLIVER
                          (flustered)
                    Right.  Just to confirm.  Let's
                    see..."I can't forget the kiss on
                    the swings..."

                                      NORMAN
                    They kissed?  Right here?

                                      OLIVER
                      Apparently so, Norman.  Now..."I
                    can't forget..." Etcetera, etcetera. 
                    Here we are: "...and even though I
                    promised I'd come back, I knew I
                    couldn't. I keep imagining you
                    there on the steps by the blue
                    door, waiting for me.  And I'm
                    sorry I wasn't there. 

                                      NORMAN
                    How could she?  She promised.

                                      OLIVER
                    "...BUT I can explain. With all my
                    talk about courage, you were the
                    one who took all the big leaps
                    yesterday and now it's my turn. 
                    So today I'm going to do what I
                    have to do to get myself well.  If
                    it works, and if you still feel
                    the same way about me, let's meet
                    a year from today and we'll go on
                    a second date.  But if I'm not
                    there waiting for you at the bridge
                    at six o'clock, you'll know it's
                    only because the jump I had to
                    make was just too far.  Whatever
                    happens, Charlie, sew this button
                    on and go out into the world.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      52.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    I know I made the rules, and I'm
                    not going to break them now. But
                    the best way to find me if you
                    really need me someday is to just
                    remember this: life is short, but
                    it's beautiful.  Love, Kelly...

      Oliver finishes and the others are quiet.  Finally:

                                      SHANE
                    Oh, man.  What's today?

                                    RITA
                    The twenty-third.  Oh, wow. 

                                      SHANE
                    And Charlie has no idea they're
                    supposed to meet in four days.

                                      OLIVER
                    Assuming she took the leap...and
                    made it to the other side.

      Oliver takes the button out of his pocket and stares at it.

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                      53.

                                            ACT FOUR


      The four of them stare at the blue door.

                                    RITA
                    I don't see another house on this
                    block with a blue door and a brown
                    door and a chimney.

                                      SHANE
                    So, who's going to knock?

                                      OLIVER
                    There is no knocking.  We don't
                    knock. 

                                      NORMAN
                    We go back to the office and follow
                    procedure before we get in trouble. 

                                      SHANE
                    Trouble?  You think Andrea is
                    cruising the park?  Come on, we're
                    standing right HERE!  Let's just...

      She snatches the letter from Oliver.  He snatches it back.

                                      OLIVER
                    And I thought you'd welcome the
                      opportunity to show us what that
                    fancy laptop of yours can do...

      He walks off.  She sighs and they all follow.


      A few mail trucks move in and out of the back receiving areas.



      Shane is marching down the street.  She is suddenly aware
      that a car is slowly following her.  She stops and looks.

      ANGLE ON OLIVER

      He is at the wheel of a vintage Astin Martin.  He stops. 
      She keeps walking. He rolls down the window.

                                      OLIVER
                    Can I offer you a ride to your
                    next career?

                                      SHANE
                    No. 

                                      OLIVER
                    A moment of your time, then.

                                      SHANE
                    Nobody drives an Astin Martin except
                    James Bond.

                                      OLIVER
                    I will take that as a compliment. 

                                      SHANE
                    You're not changing my mind, Oliver. 
                    The US Post Office is a dinosaur,
                    there's no future for me there and
                    I should have stayed in DC and
                    taken that Digital Analysis job at
                    the IRS.

      He stops the car, leaves it running in the street, and walks
      over to her.  She stops and groans.                                                                                      60.

                                      OLIVER
                    Maybe you're right; electronic
                    thought has taken over the world. 
                    We can e-mail and text faster than
                    we can think.  People are hired
                    and fired and destroyed
                      electronically every minute. 
                      Abbreviated words fly about
                      cyberspace like confetti.  Even as
                    we speak some future captain of
                    industry is texting BTW OMG TTFN. 
                    That is our future.  But a year
                    ago, maybe five, or perhaps thirty
                    years ago, someone wrote a letter
                    with real words and more than two
                    seconds of thought behind them. 
                    And we are living in THEIR future. 
                    Think about it, Ms. McInerney. 
                    There are thousands and thousands
                    of letters back there, each one a
                    voice from the past, waiting to be
                    heard.  And it will take a lifetime
                    to accomplish that.  But it will
                    be worth it.  And if you disagree,
                    then why are you so upset that you
                    don't have a birthday card you 
                    didn't even know existed five
                    minutes ago?

      She stares at him. 

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    There's something special about
                    you, Ms. McInerney.  I've seen it
                    before. An instinct.  A certain
                      compassion for the lost soul behind
                    the lost letter.  It's what made
                    you steal Kelly's letter to Charlie.

      Shane hesitates.  He's right, but he's hit a nerve.

                                      SHANE
                    I don't care about Kelly and I
                    couldn't care less about her and
                    her letter.  I quit.  

      She walks off, leaving him on the sidewalk.

                                      OLIVER
                    Shane!  Come back, Shane!
                          (realizing.  He said
                          it)
                    ....Oh, dear.                                                                                      61.


      Shane is sitting on the swings, deep in thought.  She pushes
      off and tries to get high enough to see Charlie's house over
      the trees.  She can't.  She gives up, stands, and walks off
      in the direction of Charlie's place. 


      Shane walks around the corner and looks at the house with
      the blue and brown doors and then realizes that parked across
      the street is Oliver's car.  He stands outside, leaning
      against it, waiting for her with two cups of Starbuck's in
      his hand.  She sighs and walks over.

                                      SHANE
                    Really?

                                      OLIVER
                    I allowed fifteen minutes to walk
                    to the park, factored in another
                    ten for aimless wandering, which
                    allowed me twenty five minutes to
                    order your skinny vanilla latte
                    and deliver it still hot by the
                    time you showed up.

                                      SHANE
                    And you think I'm that predictable.

                                      OLIVER
                    I think you're that invested in
                    your work.  And an employee with
                    that much commitment cannot be
                    allowed to self-terminate.  Or
                    drink sub-standard swill, for that
                    matter.

      He hands her a cup.  She leans against the car.

                                      SHANE
                    Thanks.

                                      OLIVER
                    My pleasure. Shouldn't be long,
                    now. Mailman is right around the
                    corner.

                                      SHANE
                    Kind of exciting.  I mean, in five
                    minutes he could be opening up
                    that letter and realizing he has a
                    date on Friday with the love of
                    his life.                                                                                      62.

                                      OLIVER
                    Or, perhaps he has since met a
                    waitress from Hooters and is
                    expecting twins and taken up work
                    as a grouter of bathroom tile.

                                      SHANE
                    No chance.  Not him.  Not Charlie.

      Oliver nods in the direction of an approaching MAILMAN.

      ANGLE ON MAILMAN

      He walks up the steps.  He places some mail in Box A by the
      brown door, then turns to the blue door, hesitates, then
      finally places the pink envelope in Box B and walks away.

      ANGLE ON SHANE AND OLIVER

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                            (mesmerized)
                    There it is.

                                      OLIVER
                    Once again, civilization prevails.

      He opens the car door, preparing to drive off.

                                      SHANE
                    Wait!  We have to see him get...

      She stops as a busty RED-HAIRED 40ish WOMAN in a tight skirt
      and heels steps out from the brown door to retrieve her mail. 
      She notices the pink envelope and grabs that, too, and re-
      enters her house.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    What is she doing?

      Alarmed, Shane takes off across the street to the duplex.

                                      OLIVER
                    Miss McIn...erney...

      It's took late.  Shane is walking up the steps and knocking
      on the brown door.

      THE BROWN FRONT DOOR

      The door opens and the Red-Haired Woman answers.

                                      WOMAN
                    Hi.                                                                                      63.

                                      SHANE
                    Hello.  I...um...I'm from the United
                    States Postal Service.  I am a
                    systems consultant for direct line
                      operations.
                          (she flashes her ID)
                    I'm conducting a...mail
                      investigation.

                                      WOMAN
                    You wanna investigate my mail.

                                      SHANE
                    I'm investigating the unauthorized
                      co-mingling of correspondence
                    between shared postal destinations.

                                      WOMAN
                    I don't get it.

                                      SHANE
                    You just removed an envelope from
                    that mailbox.

                                      WOMAN
                    So?  You don't have to make a
                    federal case out of it.

                                      SHANE
                    Actually, mail theft is a federal
                    case, ma'am.

                                      WOMAN
                    I wasn't stealing it.  I was sending
                    it back.  The guy's been gone for
                    months and I don't think he's coming
                    back.

      She hands the letter to Shane.  Shane looks at and blanches.

                                      SHANE
                    I'm going to have to confiscate
                    this. 

                                      WOMAN
                      Confiscate away, honey. 

      The Woman goes back inside and Shane walks numbly back to
      Oliver's car. 

                                      OLIVER
                    What are you doing with that letter. 
                    You can't just...                                                                                      64.

                                      SHANE
                    Read it.

      Oliver takes the letter and reads the words that the Red-
      Haired Woman scrawled across the front:

      INSERT ENVELOPE:

      "IN JAIL. RETURN TO SENDER."

      Oliver sighs deeply and looks at Shane.  She is devastated.


      Andrea walks through the mail room in her usual bad mood.


      Oliver and Shane get out of the Astin Martin.  Oliver wears
      a tie, a jacket, and his trenchcoat.  He carries his
      briefcase.  Shane carries her own briefcase.



      Rita stands by the elevators, looking around.  She holds a
      bag.  She looks across nervously to Shane.

                                    RITA
                          (into phone)
                    Here he comes.

      ANGLE ON NORMAN AND JERRY POPOVICH

      Norman stands behind the large Jerry as they walk through
      security.  Norman follows Jerry to the elevators.  Rita steps
      up next to Jerry and presses the UP button.  The three of
      them wait for the elevator to open.  Some PEOPLE exit, but
      we see that Oliver is inside holding a folder.  He stays
      there as Jerry, Rita, and Norman enter.  Just as the doors
      close, A MAN attempts to catch the elevator, but Shane steps
      in front of him and flashes her Postal I.D. badge.

                                      SHANE
                    I'm sorry, sir.  This elevator has
                    been secured.  Please take the
                    elevator to your left.

      Shane steps inside and the doors close.


      The Postables stand across the street by Oliver's car,
      watching the door to the jail.

                                    RITA
                    So, this it?  It's all over?

                                      OLIVER
                    Before you know it, we'll be back
                    at the DLO packing our proverbial
                    bags. Our days of rule-breaking
                    glory are over.

                                      SHANE
                    Not for me.

                                      OLIVER
                    No.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      93.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    I imagine you'll always be found
                    somewhere stepping across a line. 
                    But before it's all over, I'd like
                    to know why: Why are you such a
                      revolutionary, Shane McInerney?

                                      SHANE
                    Well, because you actually called
                    me by my correct name, I'm going
                    to tell you, Mr. O'Toole.

      Shane pulls out the still-unopened "birthday" card.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    I used to follow all the rules. 
                    Drove the speed limit, parked at
                    least five feet from the fire
                    hydrant, never tore the tags off
                      furniture.  So when the hospital
                    told me that visiting hours were
                    over one night, I said thank you,
                    I'll come back and see my dad
                    tomorrow.  But when tomorrow came,
                    I didn't have anyone to come back
                    to.  My dad had died overnight and
                    I never got to work things out
                    with him.

                                      NORMAN
                    Why were you fighting?

      Rita elbows him.

                                      SHANE
                    I'd said something horrible to
                    him.  He called and said he was
                    sick and wanted to spend my birthday
                    with me before he died.  And I
                    told him he'd been gone so long
                    that he was dead to me already.

                                    RITA
                    Ouch.

                                      NORMAN
                    But...he was your dad.  He knew he
                    hurt you.  He must have known you
                    didn't mean it.

                                      SHANE
                    He knew that I did.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      94.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    So, maybe this is a birthday card
                    with twenty dollars and a bunch of
                      forgiveness in it.  But if it
                    isn't...I don't think I could bear
                    it.

      No one knows what to say.  Oliver looks up in time to see
      Charlie walk out of jail. 

      ANGLE ON CHARLIE

      He is walking out of the jail, putting on his blazer, wearing
      the same clothes he was arrested in a year ago.  Charlie is
      instantly surrounded by a number of reporters and news
      cameras, eager to interview the innocent man.

                                      REPORTER#1
                    Mr. Riggs!  Mr. Riggs!  How does
                    it feel to be exonerated?

                                      REPORTER#2
                    Who found the evidence?

                                      REPORTER #1
                    What's the first thing you're going
                    to do?

      Charlie takes a deep breath and looks across the street. He 
      sees our gang waiting for him by Oliver's car.  He smiles. 


      The car pulls up and they get out near the bridge.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I know it doesn't matter now, but
                    I just figured, it's Friday and
                    one of us should be here, you know?

                                      OLIVER
                    Of course. Best wishes, Charlie.

                                    RITA
                    I brought you a bagel and lox.

                                      NORMAN
                    And cream cheese.  And capers.

                                      CHARLIE
                          (moved)
                    Thanks.  Thanks for everything.                                                                                      95.

                                    RITA
                    Come on, Norman, let's feed the
                    ducks.

      Norman shrugs and they walk off. 

                                      CHARLIE
                          (a beat)
                    Why did you all do this?

                                      OLIVER
                    We each have our reasons. A daughter
                    waiting for a father.  A husband's
                    wife who left him to see Paris and
                    never returned.  A loyal government
                    worker and a young woman with a
                    mind like a Wikipedia committed to
                    their work and, perhaps someday,
                    to each other.  We are simple people
                    with a simple faith in the goodness
                    of the average American letter-
                    writer.  We do this for these, and
                    for so many more reasons.  But
                    more than that, we did it for Kelly.

                                      CHARLIE
                    U.S. Postal Service, huh?

                                      OLIVER
                    An obscure division.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Well, thank you.

                                      OLIVER
                    Our pleasure, Mr. Riggs.  We were
                    just doing our job.  Oh, one more
                    thing...

      Oliver reaches into his pocket.  He hands Charlie the button. 
      Charlie takes it and nods.

                                      SHANE
                          (hands him something
                            else)
                    And, here.  Just a little something
                    to remember us by. It's...a sewing
                    kit.

      Charlie smiles and nods. He turns and walks towards the
      bridge.  Oliver and Shane walk towards Norman and Rita.

                                      NORMAN
                    It's hard to believe this was our
                    last assignment together.                                                                                      96.

                                      SHANE
                    Norman, this was our first
                      assignment together.

                                      NORMAN
                    Yeah.  I'm gonna miss us.

      Rita smiles and tentatively puts her arm through Norman's. 
      A WOMAN ON A BIKE rides past them.  Shane glances up, then
      realizes something.  She stops and turns around.

                                      SHANE
                    Oh, my God....

      ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

      Charlie leans over the bridge and stares sadly at the ditch. 
      He sighs.  He opens the sewing kit, pulls out a needle and
      prepares to sew on the button in his hand.

                                      KELLY (O.S.)
                    Charlie?

      He turns and is stunned to see Kelly standing by a bike.

                                      CHARLIE
                      What...what are you doing here?

                                      KELLY
                    Well, we had a date, right?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yeah, but...I mean, I tried to
                    find you, I did find you, at the
                    research center... but... you're...
                    alive.  My God, you're alive!

                                      KELLY
                    I'm fine!  You found me in Boston?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Boston?  No, here in Denver.  The
                    place on the fourth floor.  But
                    they said nobody survived the
                    trials.

                                      KELLY
                    Really?  Wow.  I never finished
                    the trials.  I only signed up
                    because it was free and I was too
                    afraid to go back home and ask my
                    parents for help.                                                                                      97.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I can't imagine you being afraid
                    of anything.

                                      KELLY
                          (smiles)
                    You don't know my parents.  But
                    that day, when you quit and then
                    you jumped the ditch, I realized I
                    had to do some scary things, too. 
                    So I dropped out of the program,
                    and went home to Boston and I made
                    up with my parents and they got me
                    the greatest doctor in the world
                    and here I am.

                                      CHARLIE
                    You were in Boston all this time? 
                    So, you don't know...

                                      KELLY
                    Know what?

                                      CHARLIE
                          (smiles)
                    Doesn't matter.  You ready for our
                    second date?

                                      KELLY
                    I'm here, aren't I?  But look at
                    that! You still haven't sewn that
                    button on!

                                      CHARLIE
                    I was waiting for you.

      He holds out the button.  She reaches for it.  He takes her
      hand and pulls her to him and they kiss as if it's been
      forever.

      ANGLE ON OLIVER, SHANE, RITA, & NORMAN

                                      NORMAN
                    That's Kelly, right?

                                      OLIVER
                    Yes, Norman, I believe it is.

                                    RITA
                          (weeping)
                    I knew it.  I just couldn't believe
                    she was really gone...                                                                                      98.

                                      NORMAN
                    But I don't understand.  She's
                    supposed to be...

                                      OLIVER
                    You can't believe everything you
                    read on the internet.

                                      SHANE
                    That's right.  "There are more
                    things in heaven and earth, Norman,
                    than are dreamt of in your
                      philosophy."

                                      OLIVER AND SHANE
                      Shakespeare.

      They share a private smile as the gang walks to the car.

                                      OLIVER (V.O.)
                    I have seen it all, dead letters
                    by the thousands, each one a tiny
                    paper vessel laden with good news
                    or ill, profit or loss, love or
                    pain...

      WE SEE CHARLIE & KELLY BY THE LAKE.  CHARLIE SETS ANOTHER
      PAPER BOAT INTO THE LAKE AS KELLY SEWS ON THE BUTTON.

                                      OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...Tossed about on the rough seas
                    of government protocol, a ship
                    searching for its harbor.  Each
                    one bearing the power to change
                    something and yet, each one a
                    destiny postponed...until it comes
                    to us.
