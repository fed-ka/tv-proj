       Previously on Dark Skies:  At Robert Kennedy's urging, John
      Loengard reluctantly returned to Majestic-12 to spy within
      the secret organization.  Most recently, Loengard's
      girlfriend, Kim Sayers, has been taken by the Hive, along
      with his son. It is 1965...

      FADE IN:


      INT. LOENGARD'S APARTMENT - DAY

      As the camera roams the mess, we hear the sounds of Barry
      McGuire's EVE OF DESTRUCTION, a 45 rpm spinning on an old-
      style TURNTABLE.

      We find JOHN LOENGARD, his good looks obscured behind a growth
      of beard and uncombed hair, laying on the couch, half-listening
      to the music.  From outside, we now hear the sounds of
      KNOCKING.  Loengard, unfazed, makes no attempt to answer.  A
      moment, followed by the sound of the lock being picked. 
      Loengard calmly reaches under the couch and points his gun at
      the door. 

      Fellow agent JULIET STEWART (American cover; formerly KGB)
      enters.  She, too, has her weapon drawn.

                                      JULIET
                    You don't answer your door anymore?

                                      LOENGARD
                    Why should I?  Anybody who needs to
                    talk to me obviously knows how to
                    get in.

      Loengard puts his gun down on the coffee table, ignores her. 
      Juliet walks around, inspecting the lack of order everywhere. 
      She shakes her head.  He looks in as much disrepair as his
      apartment.

                                      JULIET
                    You're losing control, Loengard.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Yeah, well, don't draw any big
                      conclusions.  I was like this in
                    college.

                                      JULIET
                    Pull yourself together.  You look as
                    bad as your apartment.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                  2.


                                      LOENGARD
                    Wasn't expecting company.

      Juliet walks over and takes the record off the turntable.

                                      JULIET
                    Bach wants everybody in for a security
                    briefing.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Pass.

      Juliet takes Loengard's weapon off the coffee table.

                                      JULIET
                    Not optional.  I'm to bring you in
                    at gunpoint -- if I have to.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Tell him I'm on sabbatical.

      Juliet sits down on the couch next to Loengard.

                                      JULIET
                    Look, Majestic's written you off. 
                    Kim Sayers was the prize.  They're
                    not sure what to do with John
                    Loengard.
                          (beat)
                    But I see something in you.  Something
                    I see in myself.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Juliet, I probably like you better
                    than when I met you, but we have
                    nothing in common.

      Juliet looks straight at him.

                                      JULIET
                    Revenge, John.  We both want it.

      She hands him back his weapon, extending her trust, and, with
      a resigned nod, he takes it.


      INT. MAJESTIC - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

      Majestic-12 leader CAPTAIN FRANK BACH and his chief of staff
      LIEUTENANT PHIL ALBANO stand before a packed house, mostly
      Men-in-Black, or MIBs.  Included are a cleaned-up Loengard
      and Juliet.  A film projector is set up in the back of the
      room, ready to go.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                  3.


                                    BACH
                    Six weeks ago, this organization
                    began a security evaluation.  What
                    we found was unacceptable.  Lax
                      procedures, protocols not being
                    followed, non-secure phone lines. 
                    Many leaks have been plugged.  But
                    one in particular threatens not only
                    this organization but the safety of
                    every living human.

      Bach nods to the projectionist.  Bach and Albano step aside
      as the lights dim and a film rolls.


      FILM PROJECTION

      As FILM LEADER counts down, replaced by grainy BLACK-AND-WHITE
      FILM from Roswell where we first shot down an alien craft. 
      It shows the military gathering, people waiting for something
      to happen, including President Walter Truman wearing his
      trademark hat.  Unexpectedly:

      A silly MR. MAGOO CARTOON appears on the screen!  Completely
      counter-point to the seriousness of the situation.

      The film now returns to FOOTAGE FROM ROSWELL.  Something has
      happened, men are running to and fro, but we have missed the
      incident which caused it.


      RETURN TO SCENE

      Everyone in the conference room shifts uncomfortably. 
      Obviously, something is terribly wrong.  Bach motions for the
      projectionist to kill the film.

                                    BACH
                    This was discovered four hours ago
                    during our emergency inventory. 
                    Phil?

                                      ALBANO
                    We've all seen it before.  It's from
                    the 1947 Roswell incident.  But fifty-
                    three feet of film have disappeared,
                    replaced by the cartoon which has
                    been spliced in.  What was taken
                    includes in a single unedited shot --    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                  4.


      FLASHCUT - HIVE SPACECRAFT

      The Hive spacecraft hovers some hundred feet above the
      observers, frightening and real.

                                      ALBANO (V.O.)
                    The Hive spacecraft, demonstrating
                    its superior gravitational override...


      FLASHCUT - GRAY IN BEAM

      An alien creature materializing on the ground in front of the
      stunned observers.

                                      ALBANO (V.O.)
                    ... the original Hive-dominated Gray
                    in the localized teleportation beam...


      FLASHCUT - PRESIDENT TRUMAN

      Truman, eyes wide, being rocked to his core.

                                      ALBANO (V.O.)
                    ... and President Truman participating
                    in all of this ...


      BACK TO THE ROOM

      As it reacts, Bach takes control.

                                    BACH
                    Given the state of our current
                      technology, this missing film could
                    not have been faked.  In the wrong
                    hands, it will undermine our work
                    and change the course of world
                    history.  Our mission is to prevent
                    that from happening at any cost.

      Bach looks straight at Loengard.  OFF their mutual stares,
      we:

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      INT. MAJESTIC - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

      As the meeting breaks up, Loengard hangs back, in order to
      speak with Bach, conferring with Albano.  On an easel, WE SEE
      that there are four suspects assigned to four teams.  One
      suspect is Doctor Carl Hertzog assigned to Loengard and Juliet.

                                      LOENGARD
                    I think you should put somebody else
                    on this.

                                    BACH
                    I've made my decision.

      Albano sees this escalating, takes his leave.

                                      ALBANO
                    I'll be down at Security.

      Bach watches Albano go, turns back to Loengard.

                                    BACH
                    You knew Hertzog.  He liked you. 
                    He'll talk to you.

                                      LOENGARD
                    I have other priorities now.

                                    BACH
                    Locking yourself in your apartment
                    and feeling sorry for yourself isn't
                    the way to find your son.

                                      LOENGARD
                    The truth is, Frank, that I'll fight
                    the Hive any way I can, but I don't
                    have the same passion for keeping
                    your secret.

                                    BACH
                    Maybe you're involved in this
                    yourself?

                                      LOENGARD
                    You know I'm not.  And if you really
                    thought I was, we wouldn't be having
                    this talk.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                  6.


                                    BACH
                          (he's right)
                    Let's look at this from a resource
                    analysis.  Majestic has a lot of
                    them, you have none.  We have many
                      priorities, you have only one.  If
                    we were to shift some of our resources
                    to your single priority...

                                      LOENGARD
                          (getting it)
                    I scratch your back, you scratch
                    mine.  What took you so long?

                                    BACH
                            (matter-of-factly)
                    I wanted to keep my eye on you.  But
                    I think you've seen what we're up
                    against now that Kim's been lost and
                    your head's on straight again.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Do you actually know something about
                    where my son is?

                                    BACH
                    We have some leads.

                                      LOENGARD
                    I need to hear them.

                                    BACH
                    Scratch my back, John.  Then we'll
                    talk.

      OFF this quid pro quo.


      INT. MAJESTIC - OP-CENTER - NIGHT

      Loengard exits, finds Juliet waiting.  She hands him a plane
      ticket.

                                      JULIET
                    Here's your ticket.  We have a ten-
                    thirty to New Orleans.

      Loengard takes the ticket, and they move off together.  Over
      this, we hear the PRESENT-DAY VOICE of John Loengard:

                                    OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                    If I wasn't being threatened by
                    Majestic, I was being bribed.

                                    OLD LOENGARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    It had been two months since I'd
                    seen Kim.  I actually had stopped
                    dreaming about her, but not my son. 
                    Knowing that he was a captive of the
                    alien presence was even worse than
                    thinking he might be dead.  I set
                    out once again to do Bach's bidding,
                    but I felt dead inside...


      EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT

      The city is alive with humanity, and a few other things.  A
      SUPER orients us:

                           November 5, 1965
                       Greenwich Village, New York


      INT. NIGHTCLUB/COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

      On one level, an emerging counter-culture hotspot.  On another,
      a Hive "nest" where strangers can come and go without being
      questioned, while exchanging information in dark corners.

      A baby CRIES and we realize the child belongs to KIM SAYERS
      who inspects him, clueless, given her new Hive mind-set.  Her
      vivacious look seems sanded down, and her eyes are empty. 
      During this:

      Poet ALLAN GINSBURG, goatee and turtleneck, spouts a never-
      published poem ("Singularity") into a microphone.

                                      GINSBURG
                    Touched by a light that cries for my
                      generation.  Aching, alone, celestial --
                    calling me to convergence, divergence,
                      insurgency of my people ... The
                    lights, so brilliant, intoxicated by
                    oneness.  Diaphanous.  Enraptured. 
                    Enveloped in gossamer with a chorus
                    of angel-hip voices in my head
                    repeating the refrain: 'We are one
                    with the Universe'...

      Accompanied by another Hiver, JIM STEELE -- the former MJ-12
      agent also taken by the Hive -- approaches Sayers, indicates
      Ginsburg.

                                      STEELE
                    Our friend is still in cranial
                    takeover phase.  But gaining

      The baby's crying increases.  It's drawing stares.

                    You need to pick the child up.  Humans
                    feel more contentment when they are
                      physically close to each other.

      Sayers stares blankly, makes no move.

                                      SAYERS
                    I feel nothing for it.

                          (firmly)
                    This is what Kim Sayers must do.

      Steele picks up the child, thrusts it to Sayers to hold.  She
      accepts it into her arms, holding it more as an object than
      her own flesh-and-blood.

                                      SAYERS
                    Why?  We don't need it.

      Steele sits down, looks deep into her eyes.  Steele switches
      to HIVESPEAK.  The following dialogue appears in SUB-TITLES.

                                      STEELE
                    Praise the Eternal We.

                    This child's purpose is to lead the
                    Hive to Singularity.

                                      SAYERS
                    It's only a child.

                                      SAYERS
                    Why a child which comes from this
                    body?

      Sayers indicates her belly, like it belongs to someone else. 

                                      STEELE

                    In order to be effective, you must
                    be of Us, but you must pass among

                                      SAYERS
                    Yes.  That seems right.

                                      STEELE
                    You still have access to the mind of
                    Kim Sayers.  Use it.

      Sayers nods.  This concept she understands. 


      EXT. NEW ORLEANS - DAY

      A city that's always having a party is about to have more
      guests tracking their dirt on the carpet.


      EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - OUTSIDE HERTZOG'S HOME - DAY

      Loengard and Juliet sit in a rented sedan.  Loengard checks a
      file labeled, "HERTZOG, DR. CARL A.", sliding out a
        surveillance photo of the house.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Looks like the place.

                                      JULIET
                          (briefing him)
                    Hertzog might still believe you're
                    on the run from Majestic.
                          (pointedly)
                    He'll want to help you -- if you use
                    the right approach.

                                      LOENGARD
                    You sound like Bach.

      Loengard starts to exit.  Juliet places a hand on his forearm.

                                      JULIET
                    John...
                          (beat)
                    If he took the film, he could turn
                      desperate.  Your weapon should be
                    ready.

      Loengard has had enough.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                10.


                                      LOENGARD
                    All Doc ever wanted to do was practice
                    medicine.  He just got sucked into
                    the kind they never taught him about
                    at school. 

                                      JULIET
                    It's not about who's at fault.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Point is, Juliet, that even if he
                    did take this film, I'm not going to
                    shoot him.

      Loengard exits, slamming the car door.  Juliet watches him
      head up the walkway.


      EXT. HERTZOG'S HOME - DAY

      Loengard approaches, rings the doorbell.  A beat, the door
      opens a crack.  Inside, DR. CARL HERTZOG peeks through, then
      opens the door just enough.  He's grey and wrinkled, but not
      yet feeble.

                                      HERTZOG
                    John?  You're alive! 

                                      LOENGARD
                    Hey, Doc.

                                      HERTZOG
                    How did you find me?  Only Majestic
                    knows where I am.

                                      LOENGARD
                    I went back to your old place in
                      Georgetown, told your neighbor I was
                    your grandson.
                          (shrugs shoulders)
                    Here I am, gramps.

      Hertzog considers this a moment, then:

                                      HERTZOG
                    Get inside.

      Hertzog opens the door just enough, then practically pulls
      Loengard through it by grabbing at his shirt.


      INT. HERTZOG'S HOME - DAY

      Hertzog motions for Loengard to come to enter the house.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                11.


      As he does, the contrast from his own apartment is striking. 
      A sense of southern taste and charm.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Place looks great --

      Hertzog shushes him.  Motions for him to continue in.  He
      turns on an AM radio.  We hear The Castaway's, LIAR, LIAR.

                                      HERTZOG
                    You can't be too careful, John.
                            (paternally)
                    I assumed you were a casualty of the
                    Kennedy debacle.

                                      LOENGARD
                    We all are, Doc.  But some of us are
                    still living.  How are you?

                                      HERTZOG
                    Me?  I'm just a harmless old man. 
                    No threat to Majestic.
                          (nods to phone)
                    Can't use the phone though.  I know
                    it's still bugged.
                          (deeply concerned)
                    How's that beautiful Kim?  She had
                    such love in her eyes for you.  Like
                    my wife before she passed on.  Please
                    tell me she's all right. 

      This hits Loengard hard, but he can't let on.

                                      LOENGARD
                    She's fine.

                                      HERTZOG
                          (proudly)
                    The A.R.T. procedure worked.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Yeah, Doc, it worked.
                          (beat)
                    So ... how'd you end up here in New
                    Orleans?

                                      HERTZOG
                    They fired me, John.  They fired me
                    from the club you can never quit.


      INT. MAJESTIC - BIO-LAB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

      Hertzog is at work studying a petri dish as Bach enters.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                12.

                    How can I help, Captain?

                                    BACH

                    research intensive phase.  I'm putting
                    Charlie Halligan in charge.

      Hertzog's eyes flame at his easy dismissal.

                                      HERTZOG
                    You put me out to pasture?  I
                    developed the alien rejection
                      technique.  I performed the first
                    cerebral eviction.

                                    BACH
                    And that was good work.  Work you
                    can be proud of.  But Halligan brings
                    more modern training to the table. 
                    He's more experienced with the
                    equipment we have to stay current

      INT. HERTZOG'S HOME - DAY

      Loengard sees the anger Hertzog feels, telling this story.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Bach doesn't have your bedside manner.

                                      HERTZOG
                    I never liked him.  But he was smart.
                            (conspiratorially)
                    He fired me because I couldn't be
                    trusted.

                                      LOENGARD
                    What do you mean?

                                      HERTZOG
                    You and me, John.  They knew we were
                    close.  After you went to Kennedy, I
                    was a marked man.

                                      LOENGARD
                    I did what I had to, Doc.

                                      HERTZOG
                    No, no.  Don't apologize.  You were
                    right, John.
                          (off Loengard's look)
                    I admit that at first I was very
                    bitter.  Nearly twenty years I gave
                    them.  You knew I performed the first
                    Roswell autopsy?

      Loengard smiles.  Yes, he's been told several times.

                                      LOENGARD
                    You were a medical pioneer.  Someday,
                    they will write about what you did.

                                      HERTZOG
                    Yes, they will.  And I hope they
                    don't write it in Hive. 
                          (turns up the radio
                            some more)
                    Then I thought about you and what
                    you stood for...  You were dead so I
                    did something to honor your memory.

                                      LOENGARD
                    You got proof?

      Not exactly what Hertzog said.  He studies Loengard who knows
      he may have overplayed his hand.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                14.


                                      HERTZOG
                    John, look me in the eye.  Tell me
                    you don't work for Majestic.

      Sick at heart, Loengard can't lie, turns away...

                                      LOENGARD
                    I've got a son, Doc.  The only chance
                    I've got of seeing him again is to
                    turn up the film you took.

                                      HERTZOG
                    I didn't take any film.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Look, if you won't do it for me, do
                    it for yourself.  Your only chance 
                    is to give it up and hit the road
                    like I did.  I'll buy you some time
                    and -- if they've got their film
                    back -- they might just decide you're
                    not worth the manpower to track down.
                          (beat)
                    You don't have a choice, Doc.

      Like a cop who's got a perp ready to confess, Loengard pulls
      a blank notebook from his pocket and places it in front of
      Hertzog.

                                      LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                    I want you to write down where it is
                    now.  They'll analyze your handwriting
                    and they'll know that you tried to
                    help.

                                      HERTZOG
                          (beat)
                    I briefed President Truman and
                    President Eisenhower you know.  I
                    had the highest classification in
                    all of Majestic, even Bach.

      Loengard looks at Hertzog, nods gently that he understands. 
      Hertzog scribbles a name in the notebook.  Loengard stands
      up, putting the notebook back in his pocket.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Take whatever you can get in one
                    suitcase.  Don't take more than five
                    minutes.  I'll be outside.

      Loengard takes off.  Hertzog's face says the truth:  a man
      facing his own imminent mortality.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                15.


      INT. MAJESTIC - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

      Bach stands at the window looking out sullenly over the Ops-
      Center.  Albano enters, followed by a technician who places a
        REEL-TO-REEL TAPE RECORDER on the table and leaves.  Then:

                                      ALBANO
                    Just got a call.  It's Hertzog.

                                    BACH
                          (nods)
                    Did we get the film?

                                      ALBANO
                          (shakes head)
                    Nope.  But we know who did.  Get
                    this, Frank.  That senile bastard
                    gave it to Dorothy Kilgallen.

                                    BACH
                    The game show broad?

                                      ALBANO
                    The one and only.

                                    BACH
                    Who also happens to be the only
                    reporter to talk to Jack Ruby alone.

                                      ALBANO
                    Brought the wiretap in for us to
                    listen to.  This is from Ruby's trial. 
                    Somehow they let her spend a couple
                    minutes alone with him.

      Albano starts the tape player.  We hear the scratchy sounds
      of:

                                      KILGALLEN (V.O.)
                    Mister Ruby.  I'm Dorothy Kilgallen.

                                    RUBY (V.O.)
                    I know who you are.


      INT. DALLAS COURT OFFICE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

      A very small, simple meeting room, adjoining the courtroom. 
      Famous columnist and reporter DOROTHY KILGALLEN meets with
      JACK RUBY, the most famous assassin of an assassin in the
      world.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                16.


                                      KILGALLEN
                    We may not have very long.  If you
                    had something you wanted to tell me,
                    talk quickly.

                                    RUBY
                    I got a war going on in my head and
                    I think I'm losing.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    To who?

                                    RUBY
                          (losing it)
                    Oh, for God's sakes, don't pretend
                    you don't know.

                                      KILGALLEN
                          (humoring him)
                    You're right.  Of course.  What do
                    you think is going to happen?

                                    RUBY
                    Well, they're going to win, aren't
                    they?  Because the bigger this thing
                    grows, the harder it is.  Pretty
                    soon I'll just be one of them.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Mister Ruby, I have to ask you a
                    question.  Please tell me the truth. 
                    Why did you shoot Oswald?

                                    RUBY
                    I agreed to talk to you because you
                    were smart!

                                      KILGALLEN
                    I know why you shot him but I have
                    to hear it from you.

                                    RUBY
                    Oh...  That makes sense.
                          (intently; taps temple)
                    They told me to shoot him.  They
                    ordered me.


      INT. MAJESTIC - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

      Bach and Albano sit at the table, listening.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                17.


                                      KILGALLEN (V.O.)
                    Is there anything you need?  Anything
                    you want?

                                    RUBY (V.O.)
                    Tell them to kill me.  Just give me
                    the death sentence.  You get one of
                    those creatures inside you, what's
                    the use of living anyway?

                                      GUARD VOICE (V.O.)
                    Miss Kilgallen, time's up...

      Albano switches off the tape recorder.

                                    BACH
                    He didn't give her a lot.

                                      ALBANO
                    It's like you said.  She's a lousy
                    panelist on a game show.  Maybe
                    nobody'll believe her.

      Only they both know the bottom line.

                                    BACH
                    They'll believe their own eyes. 
                    That missing film couldn't be more
                    clear.
                          (beat)
                    We've got some decisions to make,
                    don't we?

                                      ALBANO
                    Yep.  Hertzog?  Sounds like he gave
                    it up without a fight.  You want to
                    give him a pass?

                                    BACH
                    He already had one.  He knew the
                    risks.

      Albano nods his agreement.  He understands what needs to be
      done.

                                      ALBANO
                      Kilgallen?

                                    BACH
                    More complicated.  Loengard and
                    Stewart are on their way to New York,
                    right?    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                18.


                                      ALBANO
                    Yeah.  But I'm not comfortable with
                      a whistleblower and a communist trying
                    to bring the film back in.

                                    BACH
                    Good point.  Maybe they need a
                      chaperone.


      EXT. HERTZOG'S HOME / INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

      Loengard sits in the front seat with Juliet, checking his
      watch.

                                      LOENGARD
                    I told him to be packed in an hour. 
                    What's taking him?

                                      JULIET
                    You're risking too much here.

                                      LOENGARD
                      I wouldn't have been if you hadn't
                    called it in right away.  You could
                    have given the man some time.

      Juliet looks at him as if she can't quite believe what she's
      hearing.

                                      JULIET
                    I will wait five more minutes.  Then
                    I'm going to the airport.  With or
                    without you.

                                      LOENGARD
                    You know, you're all heart.


      EXT. HERTZOG'S HOME - NIGHT

      Loengard knocks.  No answer.  He begins to suspect the worst. 
      He pulls his gun, goes inside.


      INT. HERTZOG'S HOME - FOYER - NIGHT

      Loengard enters, gun drawn.  He looks up.  Hertzog has hung
      himself from the second floor of circular stairway!

                                      LOENGARD
                    Doc!!    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                19.


      Loengard runs to cut him down, but it's too late.  OFF
      Loengard's terrible realization, we:

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY

      The familiar skyline tells us we are back in New York.


      INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

      Loengard and Juliet enter, carrying several suitcases.  Once
      inside, they immediately go to work setting up their "spy
      nest."  Juliet opens a suitcase, exposing not clothing, but
        surveillance gear which she begins to assemble.  Loengard
      goes straight for the window, looks outside.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Looks like a clean shot at Kilgallen's
                    apartment from here.

      Loengard lets the curtain fall closed, slumps into a chair. 
      Juliet looks up from her work (assembling a secure phone line),
      sees the pain in his face.

                                      JULIET
                    John, Hertzog was a dead man anyway. 
                    He knew it the minute he took that
                    film.

                                      LOENGARD
                    No.  He knew it the minute he looked
                    in my face and knew I lied to him.

      Juliet puts the equipment aside, goes directly to Loengard.

                                      JULIET
                    What we're doing is dangerous work. 
                    I will not accept as a partner a man
                    who does not have the ability to
                    stay focused.  Do you need to be
                    replaced?

      Loengard takes a long moment to consider this,

                                      LOENGARD
                    No.

                                      JULIET
                    Then listen to me.  Carl Hertzog
                    died doing something he believed in.

                                      JULIET (CONT'D)
                    You gave him the chance to decide
                    his own ending.  It's all you could
                    have done for him.  Back in the KGB,
                    we wouldn't have made such allowances.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Yeah, well, welcome to America. 
                          (beat)
                    I said I'll do the job.  I don't
                    need your pep talk.

      The secure phone RINGS.  Juliet punches in a scramble code
      and picks up.

                                      JULIET
                    Tracker One.
                          (beat)
                    We can be there.
                          (beat)
                    It's all worked out.

      She hangs up, turns to Loengard.

                                      JULIET (CONT'D)
                    Albano.  Says Kilgallen tapes her
                    show tonight.  We have to get to her
                    before she hears about Hertzog.

      Loengard nods.  He begins to assemble the surveillance camera. 
      All business.


      INT. PARKING GARAGE - ARTIST'S ENTRANCE - NIGHT

      A group of fans and autograph seekers wait expectantly. 
      Dressed to fit in are Loengard and Juliet.  Suddenly, there
      is a murmur of excitement from the crowd.

      It's Dorothy Kilgallen, getting out of a limo.  She makes her
      way toward the door, signing autographs along the way. 
      Loengard pushes his way forward, thrusts out an autograph
      book.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Hertzog sent us.  He wants us to
                    give you a message.

      Kilgallen stops writing, looks up coolly at Loengard, taking
      his measure.

                                      JULIET
                    Where can we meet you?    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                22.


      Kilgallen begins writing again on the autograph book, only
      this time it's an address.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    P.J. Clarke's.  Table thirty-six,
                    after the show.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Is it private?

                                      KILGALLEN
                    No.  It's nice and public.  No funny
                    business that way.

      Kilgallen thrusts the autograph book back at Loengard, moves
      on through the crowd, disappearing inside the building.


      INT. THE NETWORK - NEWSROOM - NIGHT

      The skeleton night crew at work.  Teletype machines, a few
      reporters banging away on typewriters.  A wall map of the
      United States, ringing phones.  Kilgallen enters, zeros in on
      DAN RATHER, network correspondent out of Texas, got his big
      break covering JFK's assassination.

                                      RATHER
                    What brings you up to the nosebleed
                    section, Dot?

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Dan, I'm going to do you a big favor.

                                      RATHER
                    The great Dorothy Kilgallen wants to
                    do me a favor.  Now why is my
                    bullshine detector suddenly pegged
                    in the red?

                                      KILGALLEN
                    I don't have a lot of time, but this
                    is as on-the-level as it gets.

      Rather sees she's serious, motions for her to pull up a chair. 
      He huddles closer so they can speak privately.

                                      RATHER
                    All right.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    I've got a story.  The biggest one
                    I've ever had my mitts on.

                                      KILGALLEN (CONT'D)
                    It's so big, I can't do it justice
                    in my column.  I want you to break
                    it for me.

                                      RATHER
                    Let me check it out myself then --

      Kilgallen waves him to a stop.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    I know why Kennedy was killed.  You
                    come to my place, first thing tomorrow
                    morning.  Bring a crew.  You put me
                    on camera and I'll spill the whole
                    can of beans.

      Rather leans back, exhales.

                                      RATHER
                    I knew it.  You have proof of the
                      conspiracy.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Way more than that.  This makes the
                    Zapruder film you've been chasing
                    look like a Saturday morning cartoon.

                                      RATHER
                    I hear what you're saying, but why
                    give me all the glory?

                                      KILGALLEN
                    I have no choice.  This story has to
                    be seen to be believed.  TV's the
                    only way to go.

                                      RATHER
                    You could always put it on 'What's
                    My Line.'  You probably have more
                    viewers than the news.

      Kilgallen checks her watch.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    I'm late for the set.

      She starts rummaging through her purse.  Eventually comes out
      with an envelope.  She rips it open, produces a key which she
      presses into Rather's hand.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                24.


                                      KILGALLEN (CONT'D)
                    Anything should happen to me tonight,
                    you go to Grand Central.  There's a
                    locker with a signed affidavit from
                    me and a piece of film.
                          (beat)
                    If you look tonight, our agreement
                    is violated.  Plus, I'll sue you.

                                      RATHER
                    You're really playing this one to
                    the hilt, aren't you?

                                      KILGALLEN
                          (leaving)
                    It's the only way to play it, Dan.


      INT. P.J. CLARKE'S CLUB - NIGHT

      A very visible, very trendy hang-out where all the hipsters,
      movers and shakers with cash and class come to drink and dine. 
      Loengard and Juliet wait at a private booth, table 36.  They
      sit in silence for several beats until:

                                      JULIET
                    You're not the only one who's lost
                      something.  There are nights when I
                    can still feel Lev's presence.  But
                    I want to feel him, his hand on my
                    face ...

                                      LOENGARD
                    I was going to marry Kim.  We put
                    that on hold...

                                      JULIET
                    The world's on hold.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Look at us.  The walking wounded.

                                      JULIET
                    The point is, we'll both get over
                    this.  We have to.  We need time.

      Before Loengard can answer, Juliet nods off-camera.  Kilgallen
      approaches, takes a seat as she tells an attentive waiter:

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Vodka Collins.

      The waiter departs.  Kilgallen looks straight across, all
      business.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                25.


                                      KILGALLEN (CONT'D)
                    I tried to call Hertzog.  No answer.

                                      LOENGARD
                    I know you don't trust us.  Let us
                    tell you why we came.  You decide.

                                      JULIET
                    We're part of the 'Aviary.'  It's a
                    loose confederation of intelligence
                    agents, all of us determined to get
                    the truth out.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Good cover.

                                      JULIET
                    I work in Defense.

      She shows a set of DOD credentials to Kilgallen.  She indicates
      that Loengard should produce some of his own, which he does.

                                      LOENGARD
                    N-S-A.

      Kilgallen holds the badges, doesn't give them back.

                                      JULIET
                    We think Doctor Hertzog has been the
                    victim of an elaborate disinformation
                    scheme.  We have reason to believe
                    the film he has given you --

      The waiter arrives with her drink.  Pregnant pause.

                                      JULIET (CONT'D)
                    Our concern is that you have been
                    targeted.  That you will attempt to
                    bring it before the public, only to
                    have it revealed as a hoax, thereby
                      discrediting you and everyone
                      associated with the saucer phenomenon.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    I see.

                                      JULIET
                    My associate works as a photo analyst. 
                    He's the one who found the missiles
                    in Cuba.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                26.


                                      LOENGARD
                    Within twelve hours in our lab, we
                    can authenticate your film, based on
                    stock as well as chemical composition.

      Kilgallen holds the credentials up to the light for inspection.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    You're good, but I didn't get to
                    where I am falling for crap like
                    that.

      Kilgallen hands back the credentials, reaches for her purse,
      starts to rise.  Loengard takes his best shot.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Hertzog's dead.

      Kilgallen sits back down.  Juliet looks skeptically at
      Loengard.  This is way off-script.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Are you threatening me?

                                      LOENGARD
                    No.  But I'm afraid you're about to
                    put your life in danger.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Such a film -- if it exists -- would
                    clearly not be in my possession now. 
                    That's my insurance policy.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Not necessarily.  Look, two years
                    ago, I was you.  I was ready to tell
                    the world this whole fantastic story,
                    even if I paid for it with my life. 
                    But that's not how it works.  The
                    story won't come out, but you will
                    pay.
                          (the pitch)
                    If you give the film back, we'll do
                    our best to see that your talents
                    are used in the resistance.  That's
                    what you should want.  Victory for
                    humanity, not some journalistic scoop.

      Kilgallen registers this, finishes her drink.

                                      KILGALLEN
                          (to Loengard)
                    Good cop...
                                      (MORE)    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                27.


                                      KILGALLEN (CONT'D)
                          (to Juliet)
                    Bad cop...
                          (to both)
                    Classic stuff, but just not good
                    enough.

      Kilgallen rises, tells the waiter.

                                      KILGALLEN (CONT'D)
                    Next drink's on my tab.

      And she's gone.


      INT. KILGALLEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Seen only in shadows, a man goes through the apartment
      contents, obviously looking for something.  He stops, hears a
      key in the door.

      Kilgallen enters, sees the mess, and starts to back out, only
      to be roughly pulled inside!  It's Steele!

                                      STEELE
                    We've been watching you.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Yeah?  Take a number...

      Steele cocks his head, thinks a beat, then roughly back-hands
      Kilgallen, sending her to the floor.


      INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

      Loengard and Juliet enter.  Albano's sitting in a stuffed
      chair, smoking a cigar.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Gee, Albano, what a surprise. What's
                    the matter, don't you trust us?

                                      ALBANO
                    You Loengard?  Never.

      Loengard goes to work taking the photo surveillance gear out
      of the closet and assembling it.  Albano turns to Juliet.

                                      ALBANO (CONT'D)
                    How'd you and the hero make out?

                                      JULIET
                    Kilgallen won't talk.  Yet.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                28.


                                      ALBANO
                    You think she's making a move?

                                      JULIET
                    I don't know.

                                      ALBANO
                    Well, we can wait for her to leave
                    tomorrow, then toss the place.

      Loengard has been lining up the sights on the surveillance
      camera.

                                      LOENGARD
                      Somebody's beat us to it...

      Albano jumps up, pushes Loengard aside, takes a look through
      the eyepiece.


      ALBANO'S POV - KILGALLEN'S APARTMENT

      He sees Steele and Kilgallen in conflict.

                                      ALBANO (V.O.)
                    Third ring of the circus just showed
                    up.


      BACK TO SCENE

      Albano turns to Juliet, sums up.  They're all getting their
      coats.

                                      ALBANO
                        Jim-Friggin'-Steele.  Chaps my scrotum
                    that he's still around.

                    How do they know about the film,
                    about Kilgallen?

                                      LOENGARD
                    Talk on the way.  You know he's gonna
                    kill her. 

                                      ALBANO
                          (agreeing)

      INT. KILGALLEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Steele pours a full tumbler of vodka, hands it over to
      Kilgallen.

                                      STEELE
                    You look thirsty.  Drink up.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    I can hold my liquor better than
                    you.  I'm not telling you anything.

      Steele nods, cocks the hammer on his gun.  Kilgallen takes
      the tumbler to her mouth.

                                      KILGALLEN (CONT'D)
                    Bottom's up.

      She takes it all down in a couple of quick gulps.  Steele
      takes the tumbler from her and pours another full glass.  He
      hands it back to her.

                                      KILGALLEN (CONT'D)
                    Oh, for cryin' out loud...
                          (beat)
                    I'll have a killer hangover in the
                    morning but you're not gonna have
                    ... nothin'.

      Kilgallen takes the second tumbler and drains it.  Steele
      waits a beat.

                                      STEELE
                    Feeling all right now, Miss Kilgallen?

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Go to ... hell ...

                                      STEELE
                    I don't actually believe in the
                    concept.  Do you?

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Do now ...

      Her head is obviously starting to spin, her words slurring
      already.

                                      STEELE
                    Where did you put the film?

                                      KILGALLEN
                    That's for me ... to know ... and
                    you ... to find ... out ...    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                30.


                                      STEELE
                    And I will.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Yeah, with 'bout ... thirty million
                    ... other people.

                                      STEELE
                    Really?  Do tell.

                                      KILGALLEN
                    Don't know ... why they call you ...
                      'Majestic' 'cause you're just ...
                    some cheap ... hood.  And that's the
                    way it is.

      With that, Kilgallen suddenly falls to the table with a thud. 
      Steele nods to himself, re-holsters his weapon.


      INT. KILGALLEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Lock picked, the door pushes open and Albano, Loengard and
      Juliet enter, guns drawn.  Juliet is the first to get to
      Kilgallen's body.  She takes her pulse while Loengard checks
      for signs of Steele.

                                      JULIET
                    She's dead.  By minutes.

      Albano scans the room, calls to Loengard.

                                      ALBANO
                    Any sign Mister Personality stuck
                    around for our party?

                                      LOENGARD
                          (still checking)
                    Some party.  Two people down in two
                    days.

                                      ALBANO
                    Boo-hoo, Loengard.  Life's a real
                      nut-cracker.

      Albano whips out a handkerchief, uses it to pick up the tumbler
      Kilgallen was forced to drink from, wiping away the
      fingerprints.

                                      ALBANO (CONT'D)
                    We better start cleaning this place
                    up right now.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                31.


      Albano starts picking up books off the floor, replacing them
      in the bookshelves.  Loengard checks the window.

                                      JULIET
                    Since when do have to clean up a
                    crime scene?

                                      ALBANO
                    This was no murder, Juliet.  This
                    was a suicide.  The last people to
                    see Kilgallen in a public place were
                    the two of you.  If it's a homicide,
                    you're the suspects.

      Loengard has had enough.  No sign of Steele.

                                      LOENGARD
                    You two re-write history.  I'm going
                    after Steele.

                                      ALBANO
                    Forget about it.  We need you here.

                                      LOENGARD
                    No, you forget about it.  If I can
                    find Steele, I can find my son. 
                    That's why I'm here.

                                      ALBANO
                    Just make sure you put a full round
                    in that squid inside his head.  Got
                    it, College Boy?

      Loengard takes off.  He hates being called that name, and
      Albano knows it.  Albano and Juliet continue their work.


      EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

      Loengard emerges from the apartment building side door.  At
      the street side of the alley, he sees Steele getting in a
      car.  He begins to chase after it.

      His last image is Kim Sayers, looking in her rear view mirror,
      driving away from him, as we:

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

      The morning after in the Majestic spy nest.  Untouched beds,
      picked over room service platters.  A CLOCK RADIO plays Herb
      Alpert's THE LONELY BULL.

      Loengard stands at the window, peering through the zoom lens
      of the surveillance camera.  He's talking to Juliet, offscreen
      in the bathroom.

                                      LOENGARD
                    The thing that kills me is how the
                    family never even hears the truth. 
                    Imagine Kilgallen's your mother.


      LOENGARD'S POV - KILGALLEN'S APARTMENT

      The police have discovered the body.  Two NYPD OFFICERS are
      examining the room, looking for any clues of foul play.

                                      LOENGARD (O.S.)
                    For the rest of your life,  you've
                    got to make sense of her suicide. 
                    Who knows, maybe you even blame
                    yourself?


      BACK TO SCENE

      Juliet emerges from the bathroom, wet hair wrapped turban-
      like, her body covered by a modest hotel towel.

                                      JULIET
                    Every time somebody dies on the job,
                    it's not your fault.

      Loengard takes a long look at Juliet's alluring figure.  It's
      a struggle, but he looks away, out the window.  She goes to
      her suitcase, begins pulling out clothes.

                                      LOENGARD
                    If we were setting up a Hiver or
                    taking out a nest, that's one thing. 
                    But just covering them up ...
                          (beat)
                    I'd feel better working for the I.R.S.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                33.


                                      JULIET
                    Until Kim Sayers is dead, you're
                    never going to get past that guilt.

      Loengard looks back, Juliet is preparing to dress.

                                      LOENGARD
                    You don't pull any punches, do you?

                                      JULIET
                    I don't know how.  But I know what
                    you're going through.
                          (beat)
                    Shower's all yours.

      Loengard moves past Juliet toward the bathroom ... close enough
      for the awkwardness to register on both their faces.  When
      Loengard is gone, Juliet stares out the window at:


      INT. KILGALLEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

      The place has been perfectly restored.  No signs of a struggle. 
      Kilgallen's body is propped up, The Honeybadgers folded open
      on her lap.

      One of the NYPD detectives, dusting the glass of alcohol for
      fingerprints, is approached by his partner from the other
      room.

                                    NYPD DETECTIVE
                    Bellman says she came in alone,  
                    seemed a little sauced.
                          (re: glass)
                    Those prints hers?

      The second detective nods in the affirmative.

                                    NYPD DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
                    Sure looks like suicide, but there's
                    something not right.  Just can't put
                    my finger on it.

                                      ALBANO (O.S.)
                    Oh it's suicide alright ...

      Albano steps out from the bathroom with a handful of
        prescription bottles.  An FBI BADGE is prominently displayed
      on his coat.

                                      ALBANO (CONT'D)
                    Maybe not intentional but, this lady
                    was seriously depressed.

                                      ALBANO (CONT'D)
                    She was on everything from Seconal
                    to Valium.  Accident just waiting to
                    happen.

                                    NYPD DETECTIVE
                    So you feds mind if we do the autopsy? 
                    Just to be sure.

                                      ALBANO
                    Hey, knock yourself out.  Only reason
                    I'm here is Kilgallen was a celebrity --
                    one with an obsession for the Kennedy
                      assassination second only to Mister
                    Hoover's.

      All three men turn at the sound of the apartment door opening,
      introducing a small TV CREW to the scene, led by none other
      than Dan Rather.

                                      RATHER
                    Excuse me, I'm looking for ...

      Rather cuts himself off when he see Kilgallen's lifeless body.

                                      RATHER (CONT'D)
                    Good Lord.

      Albano takes charge, crossing to question Rather.

                                      ALBANO
                    You looking for Miss Kilgallen?

      Momentarily flustered, Rather manages to spit out a cover:

                                      RATHER
                    Actually, we're doing a piece on the
                    murder.  I just wasn't expecting the
                    body to still be here.

                                      ALBANO
                            (challenging him)
                    We just found it a half hour ago. 
                    It's a suicide.  And no information's
                    been released to suggest otherwise.

                                      RATHER
                          (forced smile)
                    This is New York, Detective.  Rumors
                    spread fast.

      Rather has successfully deflected the suspicion, but he cannot
      take his eyes off Kilgallen's body.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                35.


      INT. HOTEL ROOM  - DAY

      Juliet, now dressed and watching all this from the hotel spy
      nest, calls into the bathroom.

                                      JULIET
                    John...

      Loengard emerges with his shirt off, straight razor in hand
      and his face partially covered in shaving cream.

                                      JULIET (CONT'D)
                    Take a look.  See if you recognize
                    that man with Albano.

      With an eye to the camera, Loengard has instant recognition.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Dan Rather.  News correspondent. 
                    First one on the scene in Dallas
                    after the Kennedy assassination.

                                      JULIET
                    Let me guess...

      Loengard looks up from the camera, following her train of
      thought.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Same network they tape 'What's My
                    Line?'

      Juliet raises an affirmative eyebrow.


      FILM FOOTAGE - ROSWELL

      Walter Truman, a Gray, a Hive spaceship.  All in one dizzying
      shot as seen from the BLACK-AND-WHITE perspective of an

      evidence from:


      INT. THE NETWORK - FILM CHAIN - DAY

      A modest, windowless space with several film projectors as
      its centerpiece.  Lining the walls are metal shelves filled
      with film canisters and video reels.

      Alone in the dimly lit room, Rather rewinds and re-screens
      the shocking footage on a stand-up movieola.  Played in SLO-
      MO this time, the shot itself is only seconds long, but its
      impact is undeniable as --    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                36.


      -- A KNOCK on the door startles Rather, who quickly flicks
      off the view light on the movieola.

        Interrupting Rather is avuncular NETWORK anchorman WALTER
      CRONKITE, gray haired, moustached elder statesman.

                                      CRONKITE
                    There you are, Dan.

                                      RATHER
                          (paranoid)
                    Walter.  Why are you looking for me?

                                      CRONKITE
                    Just making the rounds, introducing
                    my new assistant.

                                      RATHER
                    Something happen to Rita?

                                      CRONKITE
                      A terrible thing.  Car accident on
                    the way to work this morning.  Busted
                    hip.  Out for three months.

      Cronkite gestures for a young woman to poke her head in.

                                      CRONKITE (CONT'D)
                    We got lucky with the temp pool. 
                    Miss Sayers here has actually had
                    some broadcast experience.

      Sayers steps inside.  All sweetness and efficiency.

                                      SAYERS
                    It's a pleasure to meet you, Mister
                    Rather.

                                      RATHER
                          (forced smile)
                    Likewise.

                                      CRONKITE
                    Kim worked in the White House for
                    Jackie Kennedy.
                          (beat)
                    So how's tonight's piece coming?

                                      RATHER
                    I'd like to hold off on the Medicare
                    story until tomorrow.
                          (beat)
                    Dorothy Kilgallen died last night.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                37.


                                      CRONKITE
                    What happened?

                                      RATHER
                    Police think it's a suicide.

                                      CRONKITE
                    But you think...?

                                      RATHER
                    I think we need some shoe-leather
                    here.  I'm working on an obit for
                    tonight's newscast.

      Cronkite considers this for a minute, then with compassion,
      paternally pats Rather on the shoulder.

                                      CRONKITE
                    I think we can spare a couple of
                    minutes.

                                      RATHER
                    Three.

                                      CRONKITE
                    Three?  You have some good film? 
                      Otherwise, it might not play...

                                      RATHER
                    I got the film.  It'll play.

                                      CRONKITE
                    Alright, then.  Three, it is.

      Rather nods, accepting the deal.  As Cronkite turns to go,
      Sayers lingers for just a moment, her eyes focusing intently
      on the length of film spread out before Rather.


      EXT. THE NETWORK - DAY

      There is no 500-channel universe.  There are only the Big
      Three networks.  This is the one where Walter, Dan and William
      S. worked together.


      INT. THE NETWORK - MAIN LOBBY - DAY

      Flashing his FBI badge, Albano leans in close to the uniformed
      SECURITY GUARD.  Loengard and Juliet hang back in the visitor's
      waiting area.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                38.


                                      ALBANO
                    I'm not at liberty to discuss the
                    nature of our business with Mister
                    Paley.

                                      SECURITY GUARD
                    And I'm not 'at liberty' to allow
                    you or your associates inside the
                    building without proper permission.

                                      ALBANO
                    Fine.  Call Paley.

      Albano moves back to Loengard and Juliet.  The Security Guard
      picks up a phone.

                                      SECURITY GUARD
                    Could you tell Mister Paley that
                    Agent Albano of the FBI wishes to
                    come speak with him?

      Juliet questions Albano.

                                      JULIET
                    Couldn't we do this without involving
                    the President of the network?

                                      LOENGARD
                    The man's on the Majestic board. 
                    He's involved.

                                      ALBANO
                    In case things gets ugly and we stain
                    his carpets, I want to make sure
                    he's got a janitor on hand.

      Loengard gets the murderous tenet of his message.  The Security
      Guard calls to Albano.

                                      SECURITY GUARD
                    Mister Paley's actually coming down
                    here to see you.

      Albano nods.


      INT. THE NETWORK - NEWSROOM - DAY

      Sayers walks briskly through the bullpen.  Seeing no one paying
      attention, she stops at Rather' desk.  She begins
        surreptitiously looking for the film, sifting through his
      desk clutter, rifling through his drawers.  Suddenly, she
      stops, stiffens, her Hive preternatural sense kicking in as --    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                39.


      -- Rather appears in the newsroom, sees her, and makes a
      beeline for his desk.  Sayers, busted, puts on her best smile.

                                      SAYERS
                    Mister Cronkite wanted a copy of
                    your Medicare notes for tomorrow's
                    broadcast and, well --

                                      RATHER
                    Listen, Miss Sayers, you may be new
                    here, but if you really worked in
                    the White House then I can't imagine
                    they taught you to go through people's
                    things without their permission.

                                      SAYERS
                    I'm sorry.  You're absolutely right. 
                    I just didn't want to let Mister
                    Cronkite down.

                                      RATHER
                    If anyone wants something of mine, I
                    must be asked first.  Do I make myself
                    perfectly clear?

      To preserve her cover, Sayers merely lowers her eyes and nods
      before scooting embarrassedly past Rather.

      He watches her move through the copy room where we see her
      corralled by another reporter into running an errand.

      Rather, increasingly paranoid, grabs up the phone.

                                      RATHER (CONT'D)
                    Give me Human Resources.
                          (beat)
                    Yes, I'd like to see the resume on a
                    new hire.  A Miss ... Kimberly Sayers,
                      I believe.

      While he speaks, Rather removes a small, black FILM CANISTER
      from its hiding place under his desk.  He hangs up the phone,
      and moves purposefully away.


      INT. THE NETWORK - MAIN LOBBY - DAY

      Albano waits with Loengard and Juliet.  A beat, then network
      president WILLIAM S. PALEY enters, not entirely pleased to
      see Albano who stands, then steers him aside.

                                      PALEY
                    What's the meaning of this?    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                40.


      Albano indicates a more private location to speak.  The
      Security Guard eyes the entire moment with suspicion.

                                      ALBANO
                    We have reason to believe that one
                    of your reporters is about to blow
                    the big one for us.  I'm here to see
                    that doesn't happen.
                          (pointedly)
                    Dan Rather.

                                      PALEY
                    Rather?!
                          (concerned)
                    You want me to talk to him?

                                      ALBANO
                    It may have gone beyond that.  We
                    may need to take more definitive
                    measures.  Soon.

                                      PALEY
                    Now you listen to me, Albano, you
                    can't come into my network and
                    threaten the life of one of my top
                      reporters.

                                      ALBANO
                    Bill, we're hoping it doesn't come
                    to that.  But if it does, we need
                    you to have a cover story in place.

                                      PALEY
                    This is my network.  You're on my
                    turf now.  Here, we do things my way
                    or we don't do them at all.

      Albano has so far taken Paley's outburst in stride.  Now he
      fires back, in calm, measured but terribly threatening tones.

                                      ALBANO
                    I think it's time for you to listen,
                    Bill.  People don't always act
                    rational when they get a peek behind
                    the curtain.  Words alone tend to
                    lose their impact.
                          (bottom line)
                    I don't care whose network it is.  I
                    have operational authority here.  I
                    am expected to overcome all obstacles
                    in my way.

      The menace and meaning of that are so clear, Paley has to re-
      consider.  A beat, then:    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                41.


                                      PALEY
                    What do you need?

      Albano indicates Loengard and Juliet.

                                      ALBANO
                    For starters, while you and I discuss
                    this further, my associates need
                    immediate access to your newsroom.


      INT. THE NETWORK - NEWSROOM - DAY

      Loengard and Juliet enter, trying to fit in to the high level
      of activity which goes on in preparation for a network news
      broadcast.

                                      LOENGARD
                    I don't see him yet...

                                      JULIET
                    Look, it's the anchorman.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Cronkite.  Walter Cronkite.

      Cronkite and another REPORTER breeze past engaged in a
        conversation about a kidnapping.

                                      CRONKITE
                    ... so they paid the ransom.  Did
                    they get the child back?

                                      REPORTER
                          (shakes his head)
                    Do they ever?

        Juliet sees the pain register on Loengard's face.

                                      JULIET
                    Bach told you he had information on
                    your son.

                                      LOENGARD
                    You think he's playing me?

                                      JULIET
                    Hard to tell.

                                      LOENGARD
                    If you knew anything, would you tell
                    me?    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                42.


                                      JULIET
                    I'd want to.

                                      LOENGARD
                          (sarcastic)
                    That's a terrific comfort.

                                      JULIET
                          (spots something)
                    There's our man.

      She points to Rather across the bullpen, entering through a
      doorway with a small, black film canister clutched tightly
      under one arm.

                                      JULIET (CONT'D)
                    Are you still with me on this?

      With a resigned sigh, Loengard hauls himself to his feet.  As
      the two of them set off on the trail of Rather ...

      Sayers strides right past -- a near miss with Loengard!  But
      neither one noticed the other.  Sayers is in the middle of an
      errand, carrying some paperwork.  Checking the wall clock,
      she shows her impatience and asks someone nearby:

                                      SAYERS
                    Have you seen Mister Rather?

      The busy secretary simply points in a general direction.


      INT. THE NETWORK - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Rather slips through a door marked "FILM CHAIN."  Behind him,
      WE SEE Juliet and Loengard following.


      INT. NETWORK - FILM CHAIN - DAY

      Rather approaches the single, harried TECHNICIAN spooling up
      some film.

                                      RATHER
                    Listen up, Jimbo, I need a favor.

      The technician stares at Rather' small film canister.

                    This is the Kilgallen obit for the
                      five-thirty feed.

      Rather hands the canister to the technician who puts it atop
      one of several stacks of similar canisters on his worktable.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                43.


                                      TECHNICIAN
                    Okay.  I got two more stories ahead
                    of it.
                          (checks paper)
                    This isn't in the final rundown.

      Rather moves closer, pressing in uncomfortably on the
      technician.

                                      RATHER
                    Whatever you're doing now, this is
                      infinitely more important.

                                      TECHNICIAN
                    You reporters are all alike.

                                      RATHER
                    I've got to know I can count on you,
                    Jimbo.

                                      TECHNICIAN
                    Why?  What's so special about this?

                                      RATHER
                    Just put it up next.  No questions.

                                      JULIET (O.S.)
                    No questions, just answers.

      Juliet enters, gun drawn.  Loengard follows, closing the door
      behind them.  Juliet scrutinizes the worktable and all the
      film canisters.

                                      JULIET (CONT'D)
                    The film belongs to us.  You can
                    return it voluntarily, or we can
                    move on to a less cordial alternative.

                                      RATHER
                    It's not here.  I was talking to him
                    about something else.

      Juliet cocks the hammer on the gun.

                                      JULIET
                    You're too good a reporter to lie
                      effectively.
                          (re: gun)
                    This is equipped with a fully
                      functional silencer.  You can be
                    dead and I can still buy a candy bar
                    from the vending machine on the way

      The technician registers this threat as very real.  He turns
      to Rather.

                                      TECHNICIAN
                    Dan, I'm sorry, but this has nothing
                    to do with me and I got two little
                    girls ...

      The technician heads for the door but Loengard steps in front
      of him.  Juliet steps closer to Rather.

                                      JULIET
                    As of this moment, you know you will
                    never tell this story.  Ask yourself:
                    do you have anything else you want
                    to live for?

                                      RATHER
                    I've never backed off before, and
                    I'll be damned if I'm going to start
                    today.  Not when Dorothy Kilgallen
                    died to get me this story.

      Juliet tries to break Rather with her stare, but he stands
      resolute.  She turns her gun on the scared technician.

                                      JULIET
                    Now we know how Mister Rather feels
                    about the value of his life.  How do
                    you feel about yours?

      A very tense moment.  The technician indicates the pile of
      film reels.

                                      TECHNICIAN
                    It's on the table.  He was gonna put
                    it on the news tonight.

                                      JULIET
                    Get it for me.

      As the technician starts to make a move for the film canister --

      CRAAAAASH!  Rather boldly kicks the entire table over and all
      the canisters fall to the floor in a confusing heap.  With
      the butt of her gun, Juliet rears back to deliver a punishing
      blow on Rather as --

      -- Loengard catches her from behind!  Surprising everyone.

                                      LOENGARD
                    No.

      Before she can react, he strips the weapon from her hand.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                45.


                                      LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                    He's right.  This is worth dying
                    for.

      Loengard levels the gun on Juliet, turns to Rather.

                                      LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                    Your story is going to be told. 
                    Tonight.  For better or worse.

      Off Juliet's seething eyes.


      INT. THE NETWORK - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

      A room just outside the Film Chain.  Sayers discreetly pulls
      a gun from her purse, then quietly starts to open the door,
      stops, sees only briefly --


      SAYERS' POV - INSIDE THE FILM CHAIN

      Where she sees Loengard obviously taking charge, gun in hand.

      Her own gun now concealed, Sayers picks up a phone and dials,

      Sayers speech is stripped of real emotion as she keeps an
      eagle eye out for passers-by.

      Sayers hangs up the phone.  There is a trace of her humanity

      INT. THE NETWORK - FILM CHAIN - NIGHT

      Loengard, having successfully disarmed Juliet, turns his
      attention to Rather.

                                      LOENGARD
                    What would you normally be doing
                    right now?

                                      RATHER
                    I was due in make-up five minutes
                    ago.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Go.  Tell your story.

                                      RATHER
                    How do I know...

                                      LOENGARD
                    Look, you just have to look at me
                    and know.  This is what Kennedy wanted
                    and we're doing it.
                          (re: technician)
                    When you call for the film, does he
                    know what to do?

      Rather nods.  Loengard turns to the technician.

                                      LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                    And if you do it, I'm going to make
                    sure you see your little girls again. 
                    Are you with us?

      The technician nods his agreement.  Loengard turns to Rather.

                                      LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                    We will do this together.  Go.

      Juliet watches Rather hesitate a moment, trying to gauge
      Loengard before he finally nods and hurries from the room.

                                      JULIET
                    Please tell me that was the best
                    good cop/bad cop routine I've ever
                    seen.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                48.


                                      LOENGARD
                    Juliet, I don't expect you to
                      understand.
                          (to technician)
                    Load up the film.

      While the technician gets down on his knees to search, Juliet
      unloads her ire on Loengard.

                                      JULIET
                    John, you will end up dead.  We know
                    that.  But what do you think happens
                    to this son of yours after you blow
                    the whistle?  Do you think they'll
                    just return him to your doorstep?

                                      LOENGARD
                    You want me to explain it to you? 
                    Okay.  This is bigger than my son. 
                    Bigger than Hertzog, Kilgallen, even
                    bigger than Kennedy.  This is about
                      sacrifice.  About conscience.  About
                    not letting people live in the dark
                    like lambs being led to the slaughter.

      A VOICE over the intercom speaker announces:

                                      MASTER CONTROL VOICE (V.O.)
                    This is Master Control.  We've got
                    ten minutes to air.

      Loengard exhales, resigned to his fate, and moves to a BLACK-
      AND-WHITE monitor showing the news set being readied for
      broadcast.

                                      LOENGARD
                          (to Juliet)
                    Have a seat.  Get comfortable.  You're
                    about to witness the most memorable
                    newscast in history.

      But Juliet remains standing in defiance.


      EXT. SOMEWHERE OVER ONTARIO - NIGHT

      A light descends from the twilight sky like a shooting star
      over an isolated mountain range stitched together with power
      lines ...

      BRZZZZZZZ!  A BRIGHT BLUE BEAM of light illuminates a single
      power pole.  From above, A FLYING SAUCER lowers into visible
      position above the power pole ... the light turns from blue
      to purple and -- KABOOOOOOOSH!  The transformer explodes.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                49.


      EXT. THE EASTERN SEABOARD - EARTH ORBIT POV - NIGHT

      The clear satellite imagery we expect today, but was unheard
      of in 1965.  So, our POV is purchased with somebody else's
      technology.

      On the Hive monitor, city by city, the entire GREAT POWER
      BLACK-OUT OF '65 begins to plunge millions of people into
      complete darkness.  Rolling down the coast from North to South.


      INT. THE NETWORK - FILM CHAIN - NIGHT

        A BLACK-AND-WHITE MONITOR irises out.  The last glow of light
      in the room capturing two separate reactions.  Surprise on
      Loengard's face.  Juliet jumping toward the film projector
      containing the film.

      In the TOTAL DARKNESS, we hear only the sounds of Loengard,
      Juliet and the technician.  Scuffling, punches, the sound of
      machinery crashing over.  We hear a groan.  Sounds like
      Loengard.


      POWER BLACKOUT - NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)

      Dark, chaotic streets.  Actual reporter's coverage explaining
      that the entire Eastern Seaboard has lost power for reasons
      unknown.  WE SEE scared citizens scrambling around the streets
      of New York, armed with flashlights and candles.


      INT. THE NETWORK - FILM CHAIN - NIGHT

      A long beat, then a FLASHLIGHT BEAM sweeps the room, revealing:

      Loengard is pinned under a film machine.  Nearby, the
      technician lies unconscious.  The security guard we met earlier
      hurries over to lift the heavy machine just enough for Loengard
      to extricate himself.

                                      SECURITY GUARD
                    What happened in here?

      Loengard doesn't answer.  He's too busy searching the film
      chain machine for the footage -- gone!

                                      LOENGARD
                    Damn...

      Loengard whirls on the confused security guard and flashes
      him the fake FBI badge.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                50.


                                      LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                    You work for the FBI now.  First, I
                    need your flashlight, then I need
                    you to get down to the parking garage. 
                    Don't let any cars out.

      Loengard grabs the flashlight and moves for the door.

                                      SECURITY GUARD
                    Anyone in particular I'm looking
                    for?

                                      LOENGARD
                    A blonde woman with a roll of film. 
                    Use whatever means necessary to stop
                    her.

                                      SECURITY GUARD
                    What's on the film?

                                      LOENGARD
                    That's need-to-know and, believe me,
                    you don't right now.


      INT. THE NETWORK - NEWSROOM - NIGHT

      Juliet moves past a window, using the dim moonlight to guide
      her.  Various employees are wandering around with burning
      lighters, whispering, scared.  As Juliet pilfers a pack of
      matches on a desk and slips away unnoticed.

      A door marked "To Stages 3 & 4" bursts open.  Rather bumbles
      in, bumping into things, half-crazed.

                                      RATHER
                    What happened!?  What is going on!?

      There's a cacophony of response but no definitive answers.


      INT. THE NETWORK - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

      Albano, moving with the aid of a cigarette lighter, descends
      the stairs until he sees something that stops him cold in his
      tracks.

      It's Steele, coming up the stairs!

      Both men quickly draw their weapons.  A standoff.

                    How are you, Phil?    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                51.


                                      ALBANO
                    Me?  Every time I laugh I get a pain
                    in my side.  I really wish you hadn't
                    shot me last year, Jim.

                                      STEELE
                    It's only human to hold grudges.  I   
                    know what you're thinking now.  Can
                    you pull the trigger faster than I
                    can?

                                      ALBANO
                    The thought has occurred to me.

                                      STEELE
                    It's an interesting test.  Does the
                    ganglion increase or decrease human
                    reaction time?

                                      ALBANO
                    We'll both die.  But at least I'll
                    die happy.

                                      STEELE
                    We don't have to.
                          (off Albano's reaction)
                    The film can't be seen.  We both
                    agree.

                                      ALBANO
                    You don't have the film?
                          (off Steele's head
                            shake)
                    And you think we should work together.

                                      STEELE
                    Why not?  Your own government and
                    organized crime do it all the time.

      Albano considers this, squinting as he stares at Steele, his
      one good eye reflecting like a cat's the firelight.

                                      STEELE (CONT'D)
                    While you fumble around in the dark,
                    we see everything.  Put away your
                    weapon, and we will solve your
                    problem.

                                      ALBANO
                    Tomorrow I'd kill you as soon as
                    look at you.

                                      STEELE
                    Of course.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                52.


      Albano grits his teeth, struggling with this decision. 
      Finally:

                                      ALBANO
                    There's two exits to the street.

      Steele nods and smiles.  Unholy Alliance.


      INT. THE NETWORK - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Juliet, in possession of the film, works her way carefully
      down a hallway, illuminated barely by the light of a match
      which burns itself out, plunging her back into darkness ...
      until another match can be lit.


      SAYERS POV - HIVE NIGHTVISION

        Illustrating the Hive's cat-like eye sensitivity, Sayers sees
      as if aided by a modern military night scope.  Everything is
      bathed in an eerie green glow.  What she sees is Juliet's
      figure.  A dark, distinctive shape carrying the film canister.


      INTERCUT:  MUTED DARKNESS / NIGHTVISION

      Juliet reaches an exit door, but before she can open it --

      -- Sayers attacks from behind!  Wrapping Juliet in a vicious
      chokehold, they tumble into the stairwell as ...

      INSERT SHOT: The film canister drops from Juliet's hand, hits
      the ground and starts rolling down the stairs.

      Juliet who, the superior trained fighter, throws Sayers
      violently against the wall and starts down the steps to
      retrieve the canister.

      Sayers slides to the ground but quickly pulls herself back up
      and attacks again ... jumping down the steps and tackling
      Juliet.  As the two women battle violently, we go to:


      INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

      Loengard enters.  Almost trips over the security guard's body. 
      Checks for a pulse, satisfied he's alive, moves on.


      LOENGARD'S POV - JULIET

      A glimpse of a blonde woman's head moving between the parked
      cars.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                53.


      BACK TO PARKING GARAGE

      Loengard sprints after the blonde woman, his flashlight moving
      too much to provide him with a telling vision of the woman.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Juliet!  Wait!

      To Loengard's surprise, she slows down.  And as he runs up to
      her, she spins around ... revealed in his flashlight glow  
      to be Sayers!

                                      SAYERS
                    You're fighting for the wrong side.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Where's my son?

                                      SAYERS
                    Our son.

      Sayers takes the canister and brutally smacks Loengard across
      the face.  They slam onto the pavement, roiling around in a
      struggle for the canister, illuminated by the stationary glow
      of Loengard's dropped flashlight ...

      Sayers is kicking and biting, clawing and snarling.  Anything
      to hurt Loengard ... who takes it all trying to wrest the
      film free.  Mostly, he takes the savage attack because he
      simply cannot fathom fighting back against this woman he has
      so loved for so long.

      Finally, he backhands Sayers!  Sending her rolling off him. 
      Gaining control of the film.

      Loengard, film canister firmly in hand, stands over Sayers
      laying dazed.  He is saddened beyond comprehension, but he
      now understands one tragic fact:

                                      LOENGARD
                    There is nothing left of you.

      Loengard begins to slowly move away, opening up the film
      canister.  There's nothing inside but a POLAROID.  Holding it
      up to the light, Loengard's face goes slack.


      INSERT SHOT - THE POLAROID

      A baby.  His son.  Wrapped in a blanket on a cheap sofa. 
      Staring up at the camera, scared.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                54.


      BACK TO LOENGARD

      As he digests this bitter image, we hear LAUGHTER echoing in
      the alley.  Female laughter.  Sayers.  Loengard whirls around,
      shines the flashlight on where she was ... gone.  Everything. 
      Gone.


      INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

      Paley and Rather sit alone in this elegant dining area, only
      the sounds of their silverware against their plates filling
      the silence.  Finally:

                                      RATHER
                    Mister Paley, all due respect,
                    shouldn't we talk about the other
                    day?

                                      PALEY
                    Why Dan?  You're forgiven.

                                      RATHER
                          (nonplused)
                    Forgiven?

                                      PALEY
                    You made a mistake.  You're not the
                    first journalist who thought something
                    was real that wasn't.  You stay in
                    this business long enough, I guarantee
                    you'll chase another big story that's
                    a set-up, and if you go on the air
                    with it, you'll ruin your career. 
                    You know what that'll feel like?

                                      RATHER
                    Like eatin' more crow than a Dallas
                    redneck on a racetrack in July.

                                      PALEY
                    Whatever that means, but it's time
                    to move on.

                                      RATHER
                    Sir, the film was stolen, not faked.

      Paley puts down his fork, looks directly at Rather.

                                      PALEY
                    Dan, if that film were real, that
                    would mean that flying saucers are
                    real.

                                      PALEY (CONT'D)
                    We both know that no credible news
                      organization in America believes
                    that, and certainly no future
                    anchorman could ever believe such a
                    thing.

                                      RATHER
                    Future ... anchorman?

                                      PALEY
                    Dan, with your talent, barring any
                    more serious lapses of judgment,
                    there's no reason why you can't be
                    sitting in Walter's anchor desk when
                    he retires.

      Rather has to put his own fork away, such is the baldness of
      the bribe being offered.  Paley smiles, pushes a plate toward
      him.

                                      PALEY (CONT'D)
                    More shrimp?


      INT. MAJESTIC - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

      Loengard and Juliet stand before Bach, who refers to a
      classified report on the incident.  Albano observes.

                                    BACH
                          (to Loengard)
                    A network technician insists you
                    pulled a gun on your partner here. 
                    Says you wanted to broadcast that
                    film to the whole world.  Any
                      recollection of that, John?

      Loengard looks away, knows he's fried.

                                      ALBANO
                    It's my fault, Frank.  I saw it
                    coming.  I should've pulled him.

                                      JULIET
                    Go ahead, John.  Tell them what really
                    happened.

      Juliet stares at Loengard, waiting to see what he says.

                                      JULIET (CONT'D)
                    I'm the bad cop.  He's the good cop.

                                      JULIET (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    He's so good at it, I almost bought
                    it myself.

      Loengard can't believe what he's hearing -- but he doesn't
      protest Juliet's lie.

                                      JULIET (CONT'D)
                    Rather was ready to take a bullet. 
                    If it weren't for John, it would've
                    been very messy.

      Bach studies both of them carefully.  Finally:

                                    BACH
                    That's all.

      Loengard can't wait to get out of there.  Juliet follows. 
      Bach turns to Albano.

                                    BACH (CONT'D)
                    You're sure they have it?

                                      ALBANO
                    This is one thing we can trust the
                    Hive on, Frank.


      INT. MAJESTIC - BIO-LAB - NIGHT

      Loengard holds the door open for Juliet.  Making sure no one 
      was watching them, Loengard closes the door behind them.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Why'd you do that?

                                      JULIET
                    Because I wanted the chance to tell
                    you myself how incredibly stupid you
                    are being.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Then go tell Bach the truth, but
                    spare me the lecture.

                                      JULIET
                    That word again.  Before you can
                    move on, maybe you need to face some
                    personal truth.

      Loengard snorts his derision for the whole concept.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                57.


                                      JULIET (CONT'D)
                    Have you ever asked yourself why
                    your own woman went over to the other
                    side?

                                      LOENGARD
                    They took her.  To get at me.

                                      JULIET
                    She chose them, John.  Over you. 
                    And you know it.  The question is
                    ... why?

      Loengard's jaw clenches, the anger boiling up inside him.

                                      JULIET (CONT'D)
                    All those months on the run ... living
                    in fear ... how can you blame her?

                                      LOENGARD
                    Why are you doing this?

                                      JULIET
                    I cannot be your partner until you
                    face what's happened.

                                      LOENGARD
                    We are not partners.

                                      JULIET
                    Why are you alive, John?  What's the
                    point?

                                      LOENGARD
                    There is no point, is there?  Nothing
                    makes any difference.  Human or Hive. 
                    Life or death.  It's all the same. 
                    Nothing to live for...

      The thought hangs a moment.  Both feeling the same desperation,
      loss, emptiness.  Until --

      Juliet grabs Loengard by the jacket and yanks him close,
      smashing her lips into his.  Loengard wraps his arms around
      Juliet and pulls her against him.

      The spontaneous combustion of revenge and loss, burning
      brightly into lust, revealing a human truth that cannot be
      denied.  When there is nothing to live for, it is a basic
      human desire to find something. 

                                                                              FADE OUT.
