      Dexter KICKS the door closed, quickly flips on a flood lamp, 
      lights up the room, leans into Donovan s ear, whispers...

                                  DEXTER
                    Look.

      Donovan is too scared, tries to turn his head away --

                                    DONOVAN
                    No.

                                  DEXTER
                    Oh yes...

                                    DONOVAN
                            (struggling)
                    NO! NO!                                                                                      5.



      But Dexter twists the noose tighter and Donovan s SCREAMS are 
      cut off.

                                  DEXTER
                    It s horrible, isn t it? Isn t it?

      But Donovan SLAMS his eyes shut even tighter.

                                    DONOVAN
                          (pleading)
                    Please.

      Dexter GRABS the back of Donovan s neck, SPINS him around, 
      SLAMS his face into a wall, then grabs his hair and pulls 
      Donovan s head back. 

                                  DEXTER
                    OPEN YOUR EYES AND LOOK AT WHAT YOU 
                    DID -- LOOK OR I LL CUT YOUR EYELIDS 
                    RIGHT OFF OF YOUR FACE. 

      Donovan s eyes pop open wide, and we finally SEE ---

      THREE SMALL BODIES

      Three little dead BOYS laid out on plastic sheets and spread 
      out in a semi-circle before them. 

                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                    It took me a long time to get all 
                    these little boys clean -- one of them  
                    had been in the ground so long he was 
                    falling apart -- Pulled him out in 
                    bits and pieces. 

                                    DONOVAN
                    NO.

      And then in a deeply heartfelt voice Donovan starts mumbling 
      in a mantra-like way --

                                    DONOVAN (CONT D)
                    Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord...

                                  DEXTER
                          (furious)
                    STOP! That never helped anyone. 

                                    DONOVAN
                    Please.

                                  DEXTER
                    It s time for the truth.                                                                                      6.



                                    DONOVAN
                          (pleading again)
                      Please...You can have anything --

                                  DEXTER
                    That s good. Beg. Did these little 
                    boys beg? 

      Donovan SCREAMS and Dexter lets go. Donovan falls forward and 
      lands on his face sobbing, sniveling. 

                                    DONOVAN 
                    I couldn t help myself, I just 
                      couldn t...Please, you have to 
                      understand.

      Dexter looks down at him -- 

                                  DEXTER
                    Trust me, I definitely understand.

      Then Dexter grabs him, lifts him up, stares into his eyes.

                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                    See, I can t help myself either. 
                          (w/disgust)
                    But children. I could never do that. 
                    Not like you. Never, ever kids.  

                                    DONOVAN
                            (rhetorical, plaintive)
                    Why? 

                                  DEXTER 
                    I have standards.

      And then in a flash, Dexter pulls a syringe out of his 
      pocket, PLUNGES the needle deep into Donovan s neck. His eyes 
      instantly roll up and into the back of his head and when we 
      see nothing but white, he collapses onto the floor.

      Dexter leans down, picks him up by his collar, drags him up 
      the stairs.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Flood lamps illuminate the clean, white, freshly painted 
      room.

      The windows are sealed with thick plastic sheets and on the 
      table in the middle of the room --                                                                                      7.



      Donovan lies naked, but his arms and legs are strapped down 
      with duct tape. His eyes wide open and his mouth is stuffed 
      with thick wads of white gauze. 

      Placed strategically around the room are boxes lined with 
      white garbage bags and on a smaller table next to the Choir 
      Master are bottles of chemicals, small saws, drills, scalpels 
      and knives of every shape and size. It s an unseemly display 
      of gleaming metallic, sterile utensils.

      Dexter, now wearing a clean set of pressed surgical blues and 
      a pair of surgical gloves, looks down at Donovan.

                                  DEXTER
                    Soon, you ll be packed into a few 
                    neatly wrapped Hefties and my own 
                    small corner of the world will be a 
                    neater, happier place. A better place. 

      Dexter lifts a very sharp scalpel and an eye dropper off the 
      table, leans over Donovan and with the scalpel makes a small 
      precise little incision on the man s forehead.

      Blood trickles out and using the eyedropper, Dexter very 
      carefully, sucks a few blood droplets up and into the small 
      tube of glass.  

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Blood. Sometimes it sets my teeth on 
                    edge.

      When he sees the blood, Dexter clearly gets excited --

      But after a beat, he controls himself, then very carefully 
      squeezes the rubber top of the eye dropper over a glass slide 
      and a few tear drops of blood gently spatter onto the slide, 
      then he presses a second piece of glass over it, seals the 
      two slides together -- 

      FREEZE ON THE BLOOD SLIDE

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Other times, it helps me control the 
                    chaos.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Dexter slips the glass slide into his shirt pocket, smiles, 
      then grabs a small surgical saw off the table -- we HEAR the 
      whirl of its motor running and as Dexter slowly brings the 
      saw down toward Donovan s crotch -- 

      We fade to --                                                                                      8.



      BLACK.

                                                                FADE BACK UP ON:


      Dexter walks into his apartment, closes the door behind him. 
      It appears more like a library than a home -- book shelves 
      are everywhere and all the books are categorized, 
        alphabetized and lined up perfectly. 

      Dexter walks past a stack of files, all labeled  MISSING 
      PERSONS: PROPERTY OF MIAMI P.D.,  heads to the air 
      conditioner stuck in the window -- turns it up even colder. 

      In the middle of the room is a large desk -- with a computer 
      and the book Gray s Anatomy on top. 

      Dexter whips out a set of keys, unlocks the bottom desk 
      drawer, pulls out a long rectangular wood box, sets it on his 
      desk, lifts off the lid and from his shirt pocket, pulls out 
      the slide of blood we saw him extract from Donovan. 

      Dexter stares at it for a beat, then -- 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    At least the code of Harry, my 
                    wonderful father, is satisfied. 
                          (beat)
                    And so am I. 

      He files it amongst many other slides inside the box, slams 
      the drawer shut, locks it, then picks up a Miami Police 
      Department folder entitled:  JAWORSKI.                                                                                     11.



                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    He was a great cop here in Miami,  
                    taught me how to think like one, even 
                    though I m not. Taught me how to cover 
                    my tracks. 
                          (beat)
                    I m a very neat monster. 

      As he puts the folder down, he notices his answering machine 
      is BLINKING. Dexter eyes it, presses a button and we HEAR --

                                  DEBRA (O.S.)
                      Dexter...DEXTER, YOU THERE?! ANSWER 
                    THE FUCKEN PHONE. 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      LATER

      Dexter takes a very hot shower, lathers up all over, scrubs 
      his face hard, then kneads the shampoo deep into his scalp 
      and enjoys the whole experience a great deal.                                                                                    12.



                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    She s the only person in the world who 
                    cares if I m alive or dead. She loves 
                    me. Why? I don t know. I m unlovable.  
                    I have no feelings about anything.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter quickly gets dressed. Slips on a snappy looking 
      bowling shirt, khakis, all light and airy. He s good to go. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    ...But if I could have feelings at 
                    all, I d have them for Deb. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter, carrying a box of donuts, walks down the high-tech 
      brushed metal walls and the glass enclosed office cubicles, 
      passing UNIFORMED COPS -- weaves in and out of a bunch of 
      casually dressed POLICE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATORS, then comes 
      upon two veteran DETECTIVES. 

                                  DETECTIVE #1
                    Hey Dex...

      They stop, dig into the box, each grab a cream-filled donut.

                                  DEXTER 
                          (happily)
                    Hi Bob, Dan...How re the families? 

                                  DETECTIVE #2
                          (with mouth full)
                        Mmmm...good...You..?

      Dexter nods, smiles.

                                  DETECTIVE #1
                    See you at the next blood bath? 

                                  DEXTER
                    Never miss a party. 

      The Detectives laugh, mumble  thanks  and keep walking. 
      Dexter watches them disappear down the hall, then we --

      FREEZE ON ALL THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE HALLWAY

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Salt of the earth these people and 
                    they try hard, but with the solve rate 
                    for murders at about twenty percent -- 
                    Miami is a great place for me to play. 
                    A great place for me to hone my craft. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    22.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Viva Miami. 
                          (accented)
                    Si...Viva Miyami. 

      BACK TO SCENE

      Dexter turns down another hallway, then HEARS --

                                  DEBRA (O.S.)
                    Dex...

      He turns around, sees Deb smiling, dressed in plain clothes 
      and running toward him.

                                  DEXTER
                    I like your other outfit better.

      Debra reaches into his box of donuts, grabs a powdered one.

                                  DEBRA
                    You re a sick bastard but guess 
                      what...the sex suit worked and the 
                    Captain put me on the case. LaGuerta 
                    wasn t happy, but she needs to get 
                    laid.

                                  DEXTER
                    I guess. So congrats...

                                  DEBRA
                          (jams the donut in her mouth)
                    Got any ideas yet?

                                  DEXTER
                    Nope...

                                  DEBRA
                    Well start doing your mental autopsy 
                    because I need your theories and 
                    thanks for the fucken donut. It 
                    sucked.
                          (kisses him)
                    Gotta go.

      And with that she s gone. Dexter smiles, turns around and  
      heads down another hallway.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      And we see CAMILLIA (late 60 s) sitting at her desk, reading 
      the paper, stirring her Sanka.                                                                                     23.



                                  DEXTER (O.S.) 
                    Donut? 

      She s frail and thin, too thin, looks almost moth-eaten from 
      the wear and tear of being the sole gatekeeper of the Police 
      Department s Office of Records for the past twenty years. 
      She s a tough, intuitive woman who appreciates the donuts 
      Dexter gives her but more importantly loves the attention he 
      pays her. 

      Behind her are endless rows of ceiling high metal shelves 
      packed with records and files. She looks up, smiles wide, 
      then eyes Dexter suspiciously.

                                  CAMILLIA
                    Keeping your fingernails clean?

                                  DEXTER
                    Never leave home without my rubber 
                    gloves.

      And Camillia dives in, grabs a few crullers. 

                                  CAMILLIA
                    Good boy.

                                  DEXTER
                    Anything new?

      And she hands him a fat file, labeled  Jaworski.  

                                  CAMILLIA
                    Why do you keep coming in here for 
                    this stuff?

                                  DEXTER
                          (leans in, whispers)
                    I ve told you before -- and don t tell 
                    anyone, but blood spatter isn t really 
                    a full time job. Anyway, it s like a 
                    hobby -- maybe I can help out -- fills 
                    my nights. 

                                  CAMILLIA
                    You have a morbid sense of fun. 

                                  DEXTER
                          (genuinely)
                    That s probably true. 

                                  CAMILLIA
                    You should find a pretty girl.                                                                                     24.



                                  DEXTER 
                    I found you. 

                                  CAMILLIA
                    Charming like your father -- just 
                    don t get me fired.

                                  DEXTER
                          (smiling)
                    Then who would I bring donuts to?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter, light footed as ever, walks through the large, glass 
      enclosed lab, passing the   Analytical,   Forensic  and 
       Serology (blood)  sections all packed with SCIENTISTS and 
      ANALYSTS in white coats, hovering over microscopes, 
      computers, and other high tech machines. He reaches into his 
      box of donuts, grabs the last one. Stares into the empty box.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Just like me. Clean, crisp outside, 
                    and nothing at all on the inside.

      Dexter dumps that box into a garbage can, passes Masuka 
      cataloging prints, heads toward the back of the room and 
      enters his small little glass enclosed office --


      Where he s immediately confronted by --

      SGT. DOAKES (30 s), a large, imposing BLACK MAN, whose cold 
      frosty eyes are framed by a face fixed with a permanent look 
      of hostility -- especially when he s around Dexter.

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                          (hard, impatient)
                    Where the hell you been?

                                  DEXTER
                    Crime scene?

      Doakes stares at him then looks around the office, eyes --

      The poster of Miami s,  Matador s Hockey Team,  taped to one 
      of the glass walls, but the other walls are plastered with 
      images of blood stained walls, floors, and carpets -- looks 
      almost like a  Jackson Pollack exhibit.                                                                                      25.



                                  SGT. DOAKES 
                    What about these? 

      Doakes shoves two oversized color photos of A COUPLE OF 
      BODIES, lying dead on the carpeted floor of a large hotel 
      room into Dexter s hands. 

                                  SGT. DOAKES (CONT D)
                          (hard)
                    The hotel coke-head murders? This 
                    dealer and the girl? 

      Dexter scans them -- eyes the blood spatter on the walls. 

                                  DEXTER
                    This hallmark-looking couple didn t 
                    die by the hands of a professional 
                    killer. Nope. This is child s play. 
                    Messy work -- all that blood on the 
                    walls -- looks like finger painting.

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                    You give me the fucking creeps, you 
                    know that Dexter?

                                  DEXTER 
                    Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                          (takes a step in)
                    Fuck you.

                                  DEXTER
                    Okay...
                          (beat)
                    Is there something I can...

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                    Yeah. You can give me your fucking 
                    analysis on the blood spatter on these 
                    killings. You think I m here to invite 
                    you to my nephew s bris? 

                                  DEXTER
                    I didn t know you were Jewish.

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                    Shut the fuck up and just write your 
                    report already. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    26.

                                  SGT. DOAKES (CONT'D)
                    Don t even know why I need you -- so 
                    just grab a crayon, psycho and 
                    scribble this down: Rival dealer came 
                    in -- two scum-bags slashed to hell -- 
                    dealer stole the drugs. Wham, bam done 
                    and I don t give a shit what you say, 
                    cause that s what happened and that s 
                    who I m looking for -- We re looking 
                    for a motherfucking thief dealer. Got 
                    it? 

                                  DEXTER
                          (uncertain)
                      Okay...sure...I guess, but I need to 
                    get back...

                                  SGT. DOAKES 
                    Then get back there already, you 
                    fucking weirdo, I need it quick.

                                  DEXTER
                    I m on it, Sergeant. 

      And Doakes storms out of the office.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    The only real question I have is why, 
                    in a building full of cops... 

                                                                          FLASH TO:

      A montage of different DETECTIVES interrogating a series of 
      tough, defiant PERPS.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...all supposedly with a keen insight 
                    into the human soul, is Doakes the 
                    only one that gets the creeps from me? 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The sliding doors on the balcony are open and hot gusts of 
      wind whip the curtains around. 

      And in the middle of this suite are a couple of what look 
      like tall microphone stands and --

      Emanating from the top of each stand is a series of 
      individual strings stretched across the room and pinned to 
      the blood splattered on the opposite wall and curtains.                                                                                     27.



      On the far right side of the room, the wall is almost 
      entirely covered with one big dripping splotch of blood.

      The left side of the room is very different. 

      The wall is covered with thousands of seemingly random little 
      dots of blood, but like a Pissaro painting, when you step 
      back and away, those abstract dots suddenly transform into a 
      beautiful series of descending arcs, like rainbows of blood.

      Dexter pins yet another string to a tiny splat of blood on 
      the wall completing a complex maze of strings -- a massive 
      cat s cradle hanging across the room.

      Dexter walks back away from the wall, stands next to a young 
      buff UNIFORMED COP (20 s). Dexter admires his work --

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    So what are you going to do, catch the 
                    guy in this big fucking spider web 
                    you re making?

                                  DEXTER
                    Just looking for patterns.

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    I heard they brought them out in 
                    chunks.

                                  DEXTER 
                          (up-beat)
                    And lots of little pieces too.

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    So this coke dealer and his girl -- 
                    The killer used a sword?

                                  DEXTER
                    Nope, probably a very sharp knife. 
                    Look at the blood spatter. Look at the 
                    patterns, tells a story. See this big 
                    pond of blood right there? 

      And he steps to the large blot on the right side of the wall.

                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                    That was from the initial slice. The 
                    male victim was standing right here... 
                          (points)
                    ...and the killer s knife swooped 
                    across, slashed his throat. See -- 
                    Notice the long, thick, heavy drips, 
                    here and here.                                                                                     28.



                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    Yeah, nice. 

      And Dexter points to the arcs of blood on the left side. 

                                  DEXTER 
                    Now over here are nice clean sprays of 
                    blood and there s a rhythm to them, 
                    and that can only happen when you re 
                    holding something light, moving quick, 
                    nice, sharp slices through the body -- 
                    no splashes, no drips, clean and easy, 
                    graceful cuts like skipping pebbles 
                    across a lake. This guy knew how to 
                    use a blade. 

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    So we re looking for a Sushi chef?

      FREEZE ON THE COP

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Oh God...No wonder Miami suffers a 
                    pitiful twenty percent solve rate.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Dexter stares at the Cop, then very tongue in cheek.

                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                      Yeah...Sushi chef is possible... 
                    Wouldn t be my first choice -- but 
                    hey, you never know. 

      Dexter walks around the room, picks up his camera, focuses on 
      the cats cradle. Flash, flash...  

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    Now what? 

      Dexter looks at the Cop --

                                  DEXTER
                    Now I eat.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter drives down a squalid residential street, surrounded 
      by low income housing, barbecue joints and crumbling Catholic 
      Churches. Gang-looking KIDS hang out in front of bodegas, 
      drinking, smoking -- their boom boxes blasting.                                                                                     29.



      Eating a juicy Cuban pork sandwich, Dexter pulls into a 
      parking spot, then puts the sandwich down. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    The problem with eating and driving, 
                    which I love to do, is not being able 
                    to employ the ten-two hand position on 
                    the wheel. It s a matter of public 
                    safety. 

      He picks up the new  JAWORSKI  file Camillia gave him. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But there s always a sacrifice. 

      Dexter scans a few pages of the Jaworski file. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D) 
                    Looks like Jaworski s been busy...

      He turns his head, looks across the street and focuses on a 
      small shitty looking house with a rusty chain link fence 
      blocking the side alley running along the house. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                      ...recently picked up for a peeping 
                    tom episode and flashed a poor soccer 
                    mom. 
                          (beat)
                    Time to take a little tour.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      And as soon as Dexter steps inside the front door, we HEAR 
      the loud, vicious BARKS of massive DOG and Dexter FREEZES. 

      He then SEES that massive mangy dog, out in the backyard, 
      BANGING against the glass sliding door trying to get inside 
      the house.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    Animals don t like me. Especially 
                    dogs. 

      And that monster dog spins around, bangs into the glass door 
      again -- desperately wanting to take a bite out of Dexter.  

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I don t think they approve of what I 
                    sometimes do to their masters. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    30.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And that dog recognizes me, as easily 
                    as I can recognize Jaworski...or any 
                    other killer. 

      Dexter calms down, looks around the house. It s small and 
      messy, but above all, sordid. There s a paper towel holder 
      next to the unmade bed. In the middle of the room is a desk 
      with a computer on it and an expensive looking digital video 
      camera. Dexter picks it up, eyes it curiously.  

      He then notices a stack of S&M porn magazines -- picks one up 
      -- flips through it, stops on the classifieds, reads a few. 
      Some have been highlighted.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                      Interesting taste in literature. His 
                    needs are evolving -- turning violent. 
                    He s on the fast track. 

      And as Dexter walks out of the house, closing the door behind 
      him, we HEAR --

                                  HARRY (O.S.)
                    It s okay, son, go on.

      Then we slowly --

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:


      The door closes, Dexter faces the blushing --                                                                                    33.



      RITA (30 s), sweet and delicate but vulnerable and amazingly 
      attractive in that breezy, skimpy sun dress she s wearing. 

                                  RITA
                    Be ready in a sec -- just have to talk 
                    to the sitter. 

                                  DEXTER
                    Oki-doke.

      As she smiles --

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Deb introduced us.

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:


      Dexter and Deb (now dressed as a uniformed cop) sit in a 
      booth eating plates of crackling chicken.

                                  DEBRA
                    Met a girl last week, Dex...
                          (chews)
                    This is the fucken best.
                          (and then --)
                    You need a good woman. Met her on a 
                    domestic dispute call. 

                                                                          FLASH TO:


      And we see RITA S EX-HUSBAND flipping the dining room table 
      over, grabbing a chair then smashing it over Rita s head -- 
      Her two little CHILDREN cower in the corner, and as the ex-
      husband continues to pummel Rita --

      Debra and her MALE PARTNER, both dressed as uniformed cops, 
      run into the house.

                                  DEBRA (V.O.)
                    He was a fucken crack addict, a sick 
                    abusive psycho and I beat the living 
                    daylights out of him. But she s pretty 
                    -- once her face heals. Anyway she s 
                    single now.                                                                                    34.



      Her Male Partner quickly grabs the two kids and Deb rips out 
      her billy-club and starts WHACKING and BASHING the ex-husband 
      over his head. She finally puts him into a choke hold and 
      knocks him unconscious. 

                                                                            BACK TO:


      Still eating the chicken.

                                  DEXTER
                    Sounds promising.

                                  DEBRA
                    Yeah, she s perfect for you -- 
                      vulnerable, low self esteem, you know 
                    what they say about those kind of 
                      girls...probably fuck your brains out. 
                    She needs someone to treat her nice. 
                    Want her number?

      BACK TO SCENE

                                  RITA
                          (re: the bag)
                    Present?

                                  DEXTER 
                    Yes, but even though you look 
                      wonderful, it s not for you.

      Rita smiles, spins around, revealing --

      Her two children, ASTOR (8), a soft spoken, sweetheart of a 
      girl wearing soft cotton jammies, and her brother CODY (5), a 
      soft skinned, polite young boy, wearing an oversized t-shirt 
      as a nightgown.

                                  ASTOR
                          (very softly)
                    Hi, Dexter.

      Dexter drops to his knees, smiles. 

                                  DEXTER 
                    May I observe that you look lovely 
                    this evening.

      She eyes him, drops her eyes to the floor, then says coyly -- 

                                  ASTOR
                    Okay.                                                                                    35.



                                  DEXTER
                          (turns to --)
                    And Master Cody, handsome as ever.

      Dexter rises, walks into the living room -- modest and 
      simple, right out of a cheap catalogue, then turns back to 
      the kids and smiles --

      FREEZE ON ASTOR AND CODY

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I like kids. They re important and 
                    they matter more to me than their mom. 
                    But children who witness their crack 
                    addict fathers trying to kill their 
                    mother with the hard to assemble Ikea 
                      furniture...tend to be slightly 
                      withdrawn. 

      BACK TO SCENE

      Dexter pulls cartons of ice cream out of his bag. 

                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                    Vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. 

                                  CODY
                    No coffee?

                                  DEXTER
                          (smiles, then --)
                    But which do you think melts faster?

      They giggle like crazy and just then Rita pops back in -- 

                                  RITA
                    Ready?

      And as she smiles, we -- 

      FREEZE ON HER DARLING FACE

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    Deb didn t know that her ex-hubby 
                    raped her... 

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:


      And Dexter carrying a box of pizza walks into the living room 
      and SEES --                                                                                    36.



      Rita slip on a nightgown over her pajamas, then wrap herself 
      inside a big cotton robe, curl up on the couch, grab the 
      remote and turn on the T.V. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    ...and infected her pelvic region with 
                    some horrible crack house disease. 
                    Ever since then, she s been completely 
                      uninterested in sex. Lucky for me. 

      BACK TO SCENE

                                  RITA
                    Oh damn, my pocketbook...

      And she runs out of the room again. Cody watches her 
      disappear, then turns back to Dexter.  

                                  CODY
                    Are you going to the movies?

                                  DEXTER
                    If we can find one that doesn t make 
                    us throw up.

                                  ASTOR
                          (teasing)
                    Do you throw up a lot at movies?

                                  CODY 
                          (been through this)
                      Asstorrrr...

                                  ASTOR
                          (eyes Cody, smiles)
                    Well, maybe he does. Maybe he has a 
                    vomit problem. 
                          (turns back to Dexter)
                    Do you?

                                  DEXTER
                    No, but maybe I should.

      And as they laugh Rita bounds back in, her plastic pocketbook 
      in her hand. 

                                  RITA 
                    Bed at nine, okay?

                                  CODY
                    Will you be back?                                                                                    37.



                                  RITA
                    Of course I ll be back.

                                  CODY
                          (sweetly)
                    I meant Dexter.

                                  DEXTER
                    You ll be asleep. 

                                  CODY
                    No I won t.

                                  DEXTER
                    Then I ll stop in and we ll all play 
                    cards. High stakes poker. 

      And Cody and Astor lean into Dexter and wrap their arms 
      around his waist -- hug him tight.

                                  RITA
                    Give Mommy a kiss...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      SAME

      The Civic stops. Dexter and Rita sit in silence, then --

                                  RITA
                    Will they catch him soon?

                                  DEXTER
                    Doubt it. The killer is an artist...

                                  RITA
                          (confused)
                    What do you mean?

      But now Dexter s in his own world and he says very softly...

                                  DEXTER
                    His technique...it s incredible. 

                                  RITA
                    What..? Dex, I can hardly hear what 
                    you re...

      But before she finishes, Dexter SUDDENLY leans over and 
      KISSES HER, long and hard on the mouth.

      She pushes him away -- a look of horror crosses her face. She 
      pats her dress down, frantically runs her hands through her 
      hair.                                                                                    41.



                                  RITA (CONT D)
                    I m sorry...I don t think I want to -- 
                    I mean, I m not ready for -- Damn it, 
                    Dexter. WHY!?

      She unbuckles her seat belt, jerks the door handle up, jumps 
      out of the car, SLAMS the door shut -- runs into her house. 

      BACK ON DEXTER

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    What have I done now? I m not even 
                      interested. And why can t I get that 
                    neat stack of body parts out of my 
                    head. 
                          (beat)
                    No blood. 
                          (beat)
                    Why did I kiss her?

      And as we push in tight to Dexter s face, we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      And Dexter looks grim and angry -- sits at his desk, faces 
      his computer -- the large  Jaworski File  just inches from 
      his fingers and right next to that, is the same porn magazine 
      we saw in Jaworski s apartment. 

      Dexter pounds away on the keyboard and as the images on the 
      computer screen reflect off his face, his shoulders tighten, 
      and his eyes turn cold and black.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    That s it. He s definitely the one. 
                          (beat)
                     Scream and Cream.  The mother of all 
                    rape sites.

      PLAYING ON THE SCREEN

      Is a grainy video of the attractive, but the struggling, 
      desperate Jane Saunders is tied down to a stained mattress 
      lying on a filthy basement floor -- and humping away on top 
      of her is -- a short, stocky, masked man with the same 
      tattooed hands we saw on Jaworski.                                                                                    42.



      It s unseemly and nauseating, then it becomes pure evil as we 
      watch Jaworski climax, reach under the mattress, pull out a 
      knife, and as he raises it high in the air, we --

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:

      THE FURIOUS DEXTER

      Staring at the computer -- hatred all over his face.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...Now it s just a matter of time 
                    before he becomes a drop of blood in 
                    my glass slide collection. 
                          (beat)
                    But I have to wait, because what I do 
                    requires infinite planning and I have 
                    to be careful and follow the code of 
                    Harry. 

      And as Dexter pushes back from his desk, we hear -- 

                                  YOUNG DEXTER (O.S.)
                    Is that why we took this trip, Pop? 

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:


      Crowded and chaotic. Dexter and Deb sit in a booth wolfing 
      down stacks of pancakes and eggs.

                                  DEBRA
                    LaGuerta s still convinced the killer 
                    was seen, too scared to finish so she 
                    still has me interviewing hookers.                                                                                     45.



                                  DEXTER
                    It s a waste of time. Think, Deb. If 
                    he was interrupted...

                                  DEBRA
                          (cuts him off, excited)
                    Jesus Christ Almighty -- Right, 
                    because then how d he get the time to 
                    wrap up all the pieces? What a skinny 
                    idiot she is. 

                                  DEXTER
                          (beaming)
                    But now we have a fourth body and the 
                    cuts were different. It s telling us a 
                    story -- the ritual is changing...
                    He s looking for some inspiration and 
                    he s not finding it.  

                                  DEBRA
                          (realizing)
                    So he keeps doing it until he gets it 
                    right. 

                                  DEXTER
                    I could be wrong. 

      But he isn t and Deb knows it, then shovels a forkful of 
      pancakes into her mouth and after a couple of hearty chomps --

                                  DEBRA
                          (with mouthful)
                    So, how the hell was your date last 
                    night?

                                  DEXTER
                    Great. You ought to try it sometime. 
                    You need a life.

                                  DEBRA
                    I need a transfer to Homicide, then 
                    we ll see about a life.

                                  DEXTER
                      I understand, it would certainly sound 
                    better for the kids to say,  Mommy s 
                    in homicide. 

                                  DEBRA
                          (exasperated)
                    Don t make me hit you.                                                                                     46.



                                  DEXTER
                    It s a natural thought. And then we 
                    can talk about nephews and nieces. 
                    More little Morgans. Why not?

                                  DEBRA 
                    You sound like mom.

                                  DEXTER
                    I m channeling her.

                                  DEBRA 
                    Well, change the channel and tell me 
                    what you know about cell 
                      crystallization?

                                  DEXTER
                          (eyes her)
                    What do you mean?

                                  DEBRA
                    I heard the coroner say it last night - 
                    -- he was talking about the dead 
                    headless chick.

                                  DEXTER
                          (stares at her)
                    You got that look in your eye.

                                  DEBRA
                    I was there before you and I noticed  
                    the body looked different from the 
                    others. Her pieces were cold -- Like 
                    meat packing cold, so that s what I m 
                    pondering -- Is that what cell 
                      crystallization means?

      FREEZE ON DEXTER

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    My God, why didn t I think about that? 
                    It s beautiful.

      BACK TO SCENE

                                  DEBRA
                      Dex...what are you thinking?

      Dexter looks at his sis, sips some water. 

                                  DEXTER 
                      Sorry...But it makes sense. Cold -- 
                    slows the flow of blood.                                                                                     47.



                                  DEBRA
                    Why the hell is that important?

                                  DEXTER
                    Just a feeling...but I think maybe he 
                    has a thing about blood. 

                                  DEBRA
                    That s not enough. Come on, I need to 
                    show LaGuerta and her boys. 
                          (pained)
                    They re all making fun of me, 
                      bro...Calling me Officer Einstein.

                                  DEXTER
                    Why?

                                  DEBRA
                          (as if...)
                    If tits were brains. 

      Dexter looks at her, then after a beat, says --

                                  DEXTER 
                      Refrigerated truck.

      Deb eyes him, leans in close, then says softly and slowly --

                                  DEBRA
                          What-the-fuck-are-you-talking-about?

                                  DEXTER
                          (thinking --)
                      A refrigerated truck. He wants a cold 
                      environment to slow the blood flow. 
                    Clean and...mobile, so he can dump the 
                    garbage afterwards.

                                  DEBRA
                    So we re looking for a refrigerated 
                    truck now.

                                  DEXTER
                    Probably a stolen one. 
                          (beat)
                    Think there are a lot of stolen trucks 
                    out there?

                                  DEBRA
                    You nuts? In Miami?

      They break into smiles, then Deb gets up, kisses his head --                                                                                    48.



                                  DEBRA (CONT D)
                    Love you...thanks. 

      And she s gone. Dexter looks around takes out a little note 
      pad and pen and starts writing a list.  Fishing line, 
      scalpels, saws, syringes, heavy-duty garbage bags... 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Dexter pours over blue prints that are clearly labeled 
      Baywater Condos.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                      Preparation is vital. No detail can be 
                      overlooked.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      LATER

      Dexter staples thick sheets of plastic over the windowless 
      window frames, then mops the unfinished cement floor. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    And the ritual is intoxicating. 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      LATER

      Dexter SNAPS a rubber sheet over a stack of sheet rock in the 
      middle of the unfinished room, pats it down, then cuts pieces 
      of Duct-tape off a large roll and sticks them to the side of 
      the sheet rock. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Duct tape, rubber sheets -- Necessary 
                    tools of the trade. 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      LATER 

      He sees a roll of shrink wrap, quickly whips out his filet 
      knife, cuts up the shrink wrap, makes himself a mask, leaving 
      his face pressed in and distorted. He quickly makes a small 
      slit in between his lips so he can breathe. He pulls it off 
      his face, then folds it neatly.                                                                                     49.



                                  DEXTER 
                    I m a big fan of the little things in 
                    life.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dex walks into the crowded main lobby, then freezes at the 
      sight of --

      THE CHOIR MASTER S WIFE 

      Standing in front of the DESK SERGEANT, crying.

                                  WIFE
                    I don t understand...Do something, 
                    please. Put out an Amber alert, put 
                    his face on milk cartons -- JUST FIND 
                    MY HUSBAND!

                                  DESK SERGEANT
                          (patiently)
                    Ma am, I understand and we re trying -- 
                    the detectives are looking into 
                      everything and when we know... 

      As we pan off the Sergeant and his voice trails off, we 
      settle --

      ON DEXTER

      Eyeing the Wife. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I m pretty certain I made no mistakes. 

      Dexter turns, heads toward the briefing room, then feels a 
      hard poke into his shoulder and stops. He spins around and 
      stares into the face of --

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                    I saw you staring at that woman. What 
                    do you care about her? 

                                  DEXTER
                      I don t...I was just...

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                          (cuts him off)
                    You like when women cry? You like 
                    that? What s your thing, psycho?                                                                                     50.



                                  DEXTER 
                    Just heading to the briefing room.

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                          (hard)
                    You got no call to be in there, so 
                    flee. 

      But Dexter turns, keeps walking --

                                  SGT. DOAKES (CONT D)
                    Hey! I m...

      With Doakes right behind him, Dexter grabs the briefing room 
      door, pulls it open, and we SEE --

      Lt. LaGuerta standing right inside.

                                  SGT. DOAKES (CONT D)
                          (to LaGuerta)
                    This fucking guy doesn t belong. I m 
                    still waiting for his spatter report 
                    on the coke head murders. 
                          (back to Dexter)
                    Go do that. 

      LaGuerta shoots them both a look. Dexter retreats.

                                  DEXTER
                    It s okay. I don t want to make anyone 
                    unhappy.

      Dexter turns, but LaGuerta reaches out, grabs his hand.

                                  LAGUERTA
                    He can stay. 
                          (to Dexter)
                    I d love your input and we ll discuss 
                    your case after the meeting -- so how 
                    about we get started?

      And LaGuerta pulls him into --


      The room is packed with UNIFORMED COPS, DETECTIVES. LaGuerta 
      sashays toward the front of the room. Dexter spins away from 
      Doakes, runs into a COP.

                                  COP #2
                          (playfully)
                    Hey, Dex, I got some spatter in my 
                    shorts, want a swab?                                                                                    51.



      Dexter smiles at him, looks for a seat, slides past a few 
      more COPS, then SEES -- 

      DEBRA

      Sitting alone in the back -- cuts through the crowd -- GRABS 
      a seat next to her, squeezes her knee with encouragement. 

                                  DEXTER
                    You ready?

                                  DEBRA
                          (confidently)
                    I m gonna shame this bitch.

                                  DEXTER
                    Just state your case, clean and easy, 
                    and you ll be the hero.

      And just then, Masuka slides into a seat next to Deb.

                                  MASUKA
                    Deb, how about I give you a hundred 
                    bucks and you let me put my head 
                    between your babaloos?

                                  DEBRA
                          (right back)
                    How about I stomp on your dick? 

      Masuka starts heaving and choking with that laugh and Deb 
      stares at him with a mixture of amazement and disgust.

      ON LAGUERTA AT THE PODIUM

                                  LAGUERTA 
                    Okay, settle down. Now, has anyone 
                    tracked down our witness?

      Mumbles throughout the room. Her face tenses, she s pissed. 

                                  LAGUERTA (CONT D)
                    COME ON, PEOPLE -- SOMEONE NEEDS TO 
                    FIND SOMETHING HERE. 

                                  DEBRA
                    Uh -- Lt. LaGuerta...

      Everyone turns -- LaGuerta looks at Deb, rolls her eyes.

                                  LAGUERTA
                    Oh, Officer Morgan...Didn t recognize 
                    you with your clothes on.                                                                                    52.



      Titters all around. Deb hesitates then faces LaGuerta. 

                                  DEBRA
                    I have an idea -- something in a 
                    different direction. 

                                  LAGUERTA
                    An idea? Really? 
                          (smiles)
                    Then please, share it with us.

      Deb stands, takes a breath and says -- 

                                  DEBRA
                    Cell crystallization --

                                  DEXTER
                          (very softly)
                    A little more confidence, please.

                                  LAGUERTA
                          (overlapping, to Deb)
                    Excuse me?

                                  DEBRA
                    ...On the last victim. I d like to 
                    check and see if any refrigerated 
                    trucks have been stolen in the last 
                    week or so.

      SILENCE. Everyone stares at Deb, then -- 

                                  LAGUERTA
                      Refrigerated trucks?
                            (dismissive)
                    Like ice cream trucks?

      They lock eyes. It s a stand-off.  

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    She doesn t get it -- None of the 
                      brick-heads get it and poor Debra 
                    isn t making them see it.

                                  DEBRA
                          (hard, w/growing anger)
                    No. Not ice cream trucks. A 
                      refrigerated vehicle that could cause 
                    that kind of tissue damage -- A 
                      refrigerated truck that is mobile, so 
                    he ll be harder to catch -- a 
                      refrigerated truck, that might give us 
                    a lead.                                                                                    53.



      Everyone fidgets uncomfortably in their seats.

                                  LAGUERTA
                          (patronizing)
                    That s very interesting -- very 
                    creative, but let s keep looking for 
                    the witness. We know, he or she is out 
                    there -- The forensic evidence, the 
                      interrupted cut, proves there was an 
                      eyewitness -- someone saw something so 
                    let s concentrate on finding that 
                    person. Okay?

                                  DEBRA
                    But...

                                  LAGUERTA
                          (sharp, hard)
                    Just keep talking to all your hookers. 
                          (beat)
                    Okay, that s all for today.

      And as everyone rises and leaves the room, Dexter looks at 
      LaGuerta who winks at him. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Shit...

      But Dexter RACES out of the room and down --

      THE HALLWAY

      Where he grabs Deb storming away. She spins and out of 
      frustration SCREAMS --

                                  DEBRA
                    DAMN HER.

      Then she PUNCHES Dex hard in his chest.

                                  DEXTER 
                      Ouch...Jesus, Deb...

                                  DEBRA
                      Sorry...but she made me look like a 
                    fucken idiot. She s such a COCK!

                                  DEXTER
                    Cock?

                                  DEBRA
                    You know what the fuck I mean. I mean, 
                    what the fuck was I supposed to say? 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    54.

                                  DEBRA (CONT'D)
                    I m just there because the Captain 
                    said they had to let me in. 

                                  DEXTER
                    But he didn t say they had to listen 
                    to you.

                                  DEBRA
                    Right again, so say adios to my 
                    career. I m going to die a meter maid. 

                                  DEXTER
                    There is another way. Find the truck.

      And just then LaGuerta appears.

                                  LAGUERTA
                    Excuse me.
                          (smiling to Dex)
                    Dexter. My office, please. 

      LaGuerta turns, saunters away. Deb stares at Dex with a look 
      of utter amazement. 

                                  DEBRA
                    What the hell was that? What the 
                    fu...You boning her? Oh my God...

      And Deb takes off.

                                  DEXTER
                    NO...Deb, wait...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      LATER

      Dex has all his pictures of the blood splattered hotel suite 
      on easels. Faces Lt. LaGuerta and Sgt. Doakes. 

                                  DEXTER
                    It has nothing to do with drugs. 

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                    This is a waste of our goddamn time.

                                  LAGUERTA
                    I think Sgt. Doakes is right. 

      Dex eyes LaGuerta and Doakes looks like he s about to pull 
      his gun. Dex eyes him, then says evenly --                                                                                    55.



                                  DEXTER 
                    I read the other reports -- all the 
                    other forensic analysis and everyone 
                    agrees. The coke-head murders had 
                    nothing to do with cocaine. It was a 
                    crime of passion. The murderer came 
                    there to kill the woman -- not the 
                    dealer. He did him quick and got him 
                    out of the way but he sure as hell 
                    took his sweet time slicing up that 
                    lady and you don t do that unless you 
                    have a long personal relationship with 
                    someone -- probably an ex-boyfriend.
                          (beat)
                    That s who I d look for. 

                                  LAGUERTA
                      Okay...It s a bit of a push, but Sgt, 
                    you should check it out anyway. 

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                          (stares at Dexter)
                    I m watching you, motherfucker. 

      And as we push into Dexter s face, we HEAR the CRACK of 
      thunder, and we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      MOVING P.O.V.

      And we see Jaworski slowly head up the stairs, walk down the 
      hallway, then disappear into a second story room. 

      DOORWAY P.O.V.

      And we see Jaworski, struggling with a large piece of copper 
      tubing, turning his wrench, over and over until the tubing is 
      finally freed. 

      Sweating, Jaworski, picks up a pile of tubing, cradles it in 
      his arms, heads for the door and as soon as he steps into the 
      doorway, he stops -- FREEZES.

      SEES a picture of Jane Saunders pinned to the wall. 

      Then in a FLASH --

      Dexter, wearing a rubber apron over his clothes and his face 
      all pressed and distorted from that shrink wrap mask is 
      behind him -- his filet knife pressed into Jaworski s neck. 

                                  DEXTER 
                    Don t move and don t make a sound.

                                  JAWORSKI
                    Hey, wait a...                                                                                    57.



      And with that, Dexter pulls a syringe out of his pocket, 
      plunges the needle deep into Jaworski s neck and Jaworski 
      crumbles to the ground. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jaworski s naked body is shrink wrapped down over a stack of 
      sheet rock. Duct tape stretched across his mouth. 

      Next to him is a small table covered with a gleaming, lethal 
      set of filet knives of various shapes and sizes. 

      Dexter peels the mask off his face, leans over Jaworski and 
      stares into his eyes.

                                  DEXTER
                    Let s talk.

      Jaworski struggles, shakes his head and Dexter rips the duct 
      tape off his face. 

                                  JAWORSKI
                          (pained)
                    Fuck...

                                  DEXTER
                    Talk.

                                  JAWORSKI 
                          (eyes wild with fear)
                    What? What do you mean?

                                  DEXTER
                    I think you know what I mean.

                                  JAWORSKI
                    No.

      And with that, Dexter very casually and smoothly, draws the 
      scalpel across Jaworski s cheek.  

                                  JAWORSKI (CONT D)
                    Oh, God...

                                  DEXTER
                          (tight, hard)
                    Now talk to me about Jane Saunders.

      Beat. Then Dexter lifts the scalpel again.                                                                                     58.



                                  JAWORSKI
                          (weakly)
                      Okay...okay...
                          (beat)
                    I did her.

                                  DEXTER
                    How? 

      Beat.

                                  JAWORSKI
                    In a movie -- snuff film.
                          (and then)
                    But I m not sorry.

                                  DEXTER
                    Of course not. And now, I m not sorry, 
                    either.

      And with that, Dexter lifts up his knife and we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter cleans up, wipes his knife clean, whips the rubber 
      apron off his body, and as he shakes his gloves off into his 
      tote bag -- he suddenly stops, looks down, reaches into his 
      pants pocket and pulls out his vibrating cell phone.

                                  DEXTER
                            (pleasantly)
                    Hello?

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Rita has the phone pressed hard against her ear.

                                  RITA
                    I m sorry...I mean, I m sorry about 
                    the other night, but uh...Well, uh, 
                    Dex -- I really need to see you, so 
                    can you --- I mean, can you come by 
                    tonight -- just for, you know -- like 
                    a little while. I m really...What are 
                    you doing now?                                                                                    59.



      DEXTER 

      Looks at all the white Hefty garbage bags filled with bits 
      and pieces of Jaworksi neatly stacked in a pile across the 
      room. 

                                  DEXTER
                    Just finishing up a little project, 
                    but I ll try to come by later. 
                          (beat)
                    Okay, bye.

      He hangs up, then lifts a double layered glass slide of blood 
      out of his shirt pocket, stares at it, smiles.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter drives in the pouring rain down Biscayne Blvd --

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I feel a lot better now. Always do 
                      afterwards. One less amateur film 
                    maker polluting the internet. 

      Then out of the corner of his eye, he SEES --

      A REFRIGERATED TRUCK

      Barreling down a side street. Dexter s shocked -- whips his 
      head around. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    No...Can t be.

      But Dex makes a quick U-turn, almost fishtails, twisting and 
      turning then heads down that side street where we SEE --

      THE TRUCK

      Speeding down one block after another.

      DEXTER

      Nails the gas, but his Civic struggles to keep up. 

      THE TRUCK

      Now a few blocks away, makes a sharp right.

      DEXTER                                                                                    60.



      Follows, but the light up ahead turns red and as Dexter comes 
      to a stop, he watches --

      THE TRUCK

      Turn onto the causeway and disappear.

      DEXTER

      Waits impatiently for the light to turn. Red...red...red... 
      still red, then finally it turns green and Dexter floors it.  

      THE CIVIC

      Screeches forward, turns onto the causeway, races down the 
      highway, then SEES --

      THE TRUCK

      RACING BACK TOWARD DEXTER -- and it s getting closer, closer. 

      DEXTER 

      Turns white, then grips the wheel tighter and as he gets 
      closer to the oncoming truck, he sees --

      THE DRIVER S ARM 

      Pop out of the driver s side window and the Driver s hand is 
      holding something very large.

      THE TRUCK AND THE CAR

      Are getting closer...closer and right before they collide --

      THE TRUCK

      Swerves and the Driver throws --

      A SEVERED HEAD 

      Right into Dexter s windshield. The glass SHATTERS and...

      DEXTER S HORRIFIED

      SLAMS on the brakes and --

      THE HEAD

      Rolls off the hood, BOUNCES onto the wet causeway and starts 
      rolling and skipping, heading straight toward the edge of the 
      road and coming dangerously close to falling into the water 
      below.                                                                                      61.



      DEXTER

      Jumps out of the car, RACES after the rolling head, catches 
      up to it, bends down and GRABS IT --

      But the rain soaked, bloodless-head SLIPS through his fingers 
      and scoots away from him. Then with a burst of energy, Dexter 
      lunges -- TACKLES that head like a football and pulls it in 
      close and tight with his hands.

      He takes a couple of deep breaths, rises to his feet and...

      Standing alone in the middle of the empty road, and with the 
      rain still pouring down on him, Dexter lifts the head up, 
      looks into her eyes.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter follows Rita into the living room -- she turns, faces 
      him. 

                                  RITA
                    I don t want to lose you, Dex.

                                  DEXTER
                      Okay...Sure...

                                  RITA
                    And I want you... 

      And with that, she opens her robe and shyly shows Dexter the 
      simple but elegant nightgown she s wearing underneath. 

                                  RITA (CONT D)
                          (nervously)
                    Dex...I want to make love to you.

                                  DEXTER 
                    Oh, okay, thanks.

      And Rita reaches out, slowly pulls him close. They start to 
      kiss, then she stops, pulls back --                                                                                     65.



                                  RITA
                    Don t worry, the Doctor s cleared up 
                    that little problem I had. 

                                  DEXTER
                            (hesitantly)
                    Okay, that s...that s good. 

      And as they begin making love and the GROANING starts, we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter steps inside, closes the door. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Wow. Sex. How did that happen? But she 
                    seemed pleased so I guess I didn t 
                      disappoint her. 

      He looks around the room, all seems fine and he heads into --

      THE DARK KITCHEN

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But that s because I don t care, and 
                    chances are if you don t care about 
                      something, you ll be better at it.

      He flips on the light --

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                      Performance anxiety must be a bitch. 

      And then he SEES -- 

      A BARBIE DOLL S HEAD

      Scotched taped and hanging by its hair on the refrigerator 
      door and Dexter FREEZES -- stares at the head. He s clearly 
      tense, unnerved. 

      Dexter slowly approaches the refrigerator, touches the Barbie 
      head and as it swings gently back and forth, he slowly opens 
      the freezer door and inside he finds --

      THE BARBIE DOLL BODY PARTS 

      Neatly stacked and tied together with little pink ribbons -- 
      just like the bloodless bodies, sans the little pink ribbons. 

      After a beat, Dexter s body relaxes --                                                                                     66.



                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I suppose I should be upset, even feel 
                    violated, but I m not. 

      And then he notices -- 

      A SMALL VANITY MIRROR

      Stuck in one of Barbie s hands. He pulls the tiny mirror out 
      of the doll s hand, stares into it. And we see little 
      fragmented images of Dexter s face off the mirror. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    No...In fact, I think this is a 
                    friendly message -- Kind of like, 
                     Hey, want to play? 

      Dex puts the mirror down, closes the freezer door, and as he 
      looks down at the little Barbie head swinging on the 
        refrigerator door again, we --

      FREEZE ON DEXTER S SMILING FACE

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And yes, I want to play...I really, 
                    really do.

      And on that, we --

                                                                            FADE TO:
