CLOSE ON: Blake's dead body. His eyes are wide open, not in
fear, but in resignation. As BLOOD starts to POOL behind his
head, we move to the happy face pin Blake wore, now on the
sidewalk by his neck. We slowly ZOOM IN on the pin as blood
DRIPS on it
. when the pin is WASHED AWAY.
A SHOPKEEPER has his HOSE out, spraying off the blood from
the sidewalk. Blake's body is gone, a CHALK OUTLINE in its
place. A COP comes running up to the Shopkeeper.
COP 1
Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene!
SHOPKEEPER
It's been over four hours, I got a
business to run--
As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as
the water carries it to a DRAIN--
--when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV
as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it.
We never see his face. We move from his POV--
--to across the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at
the news stand stare at. the crime scene. At the cop still
arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow
tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake's BODY BAG.
Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse
the magazines and periodicals, most of which have
inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere
currently in the world--a Newsweek headline reads "War?", The
New York Times: "China Moves Battleships near Taiwanese
Waters," The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President
with Dr. Manhattan: "What Me Worry?"
The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning at the papers.
NEWS VENDOR
(re: headlines)
Depressing ain't it?
MAN
But good for business, right?

NEWS VENDOR
Yeah. Irony's a bitch.
The man pays for a newspaper when A HOMELESS MAN taps the
News Vendor on the shoulder.
HOMELESS MAN
The current issue of The New
Frontiersman, where is it?
NEWS VENDOR
It's late this month.
HOMELESS MAN
When will it be here?
NEWS VENDOR
I dunno, pal, like I said, it's late--
We MOVE BACK ACROSS THE STREET, to Blake's apartment
building, then MOVE UP the building, to the broken glass
window Blake was thrown out of. We MOVE INTO THE WINDOW--
Outside Blake's apartment building. It's later now, the news
stand is closed, businesses closed, people gone.
We move into someone's POV. The person stares up at the
broken window of Blake's apartment, now covered with PLASTIC
SHEETING.
RORSCHACH (V.0.)
Rorschach's Journal, October 12th.
Earlier today I came across what appeared
to be a suicide. It was later learned to
be a homicide. Someone's time was up.
Still in POV, we see the person pull something from his
pocket--the happy face pin. We realize that this was the
person whose POV we were in earlier.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I discovered a clue. Something I
recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly
. I heard my own clock ticking.
We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time--
RORSCHACH (roar-shock)--a masked vigilante who wears a trench
coat, fedora, and a silver-white MASK with oily BLACK SPOTS
moving about, creating shifting, doubled PATTERNS like a
Rorschach test. Scary looking.
Rorschach draws a hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and
FIRES the HOOK AND CABLE THIRTY STORIES UP where it latches
itself through Blake's broken window. Pressing RETRACT,
Rorschach FLIES UP THE WALL to the 30th floor.

Dan descends the stairs. He pulls up his collar against the
cold and walks down an alley. A SIGN below Hollis' apartment
reads: "MASON AUTO REPAIRS--Obsolete models a specialty!"
10.
Dan walks down the empty street to his TOWNHOUSE, digging for
his keys. Then he stops, suddenly alert.
His front door hangs slightly OPEN--the LOCK'S been SMASHED.
There's a LIGHT on inside. Cautious, Dan enters the house.
A mammoth, shining skyscraper. At the 50th-floor there is a
HUGE V-SHAPED HOLE where WATER FALLS.
We're now actually with the two Soldiers on patrol. One of
the Soldiers takes out a pair of binoculars, looking into the
mountains. (They speak in Baluchi)
PAKISTANI SOLDIER
We should attack the Indian bastards. I
don't understand--
CUT TO: POV--a SNIPER SCOPE, locked in on the Pakistani
soldier.
INDIAN SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
--why I can't just pull this trigger.
We see two Indian Soldiers, hidden in the mountains, one with
his sniper rifle aimed. (They speak in Hindi)
INDIAN SOLDIER #2
Because then a battle begins. Then a war.
And then the Americans will send--
A SIGN posted on a RAZOR-WIRE FENCE reads: ROCKEFELLER
MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER. An M16-toting GUARD stands at the
gate.
We move into Rorschach's POV as he approaches the gate. The
guard has no reaction to Rorschach--
--because Rorschach is in disguise, wearing the Army
Officer's uniform he stole. Rorschach presents his ID. The
Guard waves him through.
A group of suspicious looking MIDDLE EASTERN MEN watch as a
CONTAINER is being loaded onto a TRUCK--

floating in mid-air. The Middle Eastern Men shield their eyes
from the light, then realize in awe and fear
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
(in Arabic)
It's him He's, he's real. Allah
help us, he's real!
The men run for it but it's useless--Dr. Manhattan shoots
BEAMS OF ENERGY at them, freezing all the men in mid motion--
--when PORT SECURITY pulls up. They get out of their jeeps,
in awe of Dr. Manhattan, still floating in mid-air.
DR. MANHATTAN
These men were transporting a shipment of
enriched uranium--
With a gesture, the container floats off the truck and
separates into pieces . . revealing the URANIUM inside.
Suddenly the uranium changes--
DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
I've safely transformed the uranium into
sand. I trust you can take things from
here.
And just like that he disappears--
Rorschach materializes down the road from the base.
RORSCHACH
--had my say
Rorschach realizes what just happened. Checks himself, his
surroundings. Reorients himself. With nothing else he can do,
he heads down the road.
We move down the beautifully lit New York city skyline,
passing the Brooklyn Bridge . the Statue of Liberty
and the in Towers of the World Trade Center?
We hear the LAUGHTER--
24.
Dan and Laurie step outside.
LAURIE
Y1 know, when I think back, why did we do
it? Why did we dress up like that? I
think the Keene Act was the best thing to
ever happen to us.
DAN
You're probably right.
LAURIE
I mean, you remember my costume? All that
tight spandex? That was awful.
DAN
Uh, yeah. Awful.
LAURIE
And to think my own mother pushed me into
that spandex. Pushed me into the whole
costume thing in the first place. Wanted
her little girl to be just like mommy and
fight bad guys.

Well, I guess my ride is here.
She gives Dan a hug.
LAURIE (CONT'D)
We'll do this again.
DAN
Yeah. I'd really like that.
Laurie crosses the street and gets into the sedan. As Dan
watches the car drive off, TWO KIDS nearly bump into him,
running around playing. The Kids make flying noises.
KID 1
I'm Dr. Manhattan, saving the Twin
Towers!
KID 2
No, I wanna be Dr. Manhattan!
MOTHER
You can take turns, okay?
Dan watches the Kids for a moment, then walks away. The Twin
Towers looming behind him.
Days later. A few mourners gather in the rain for Edward
Blake aka The Comedian's funeral. Mostly government types.
Dan, Adrian and Dr. Manhattan line the edge of an open grave.
Bright California sunshine gleams over this upscale condo
facility. Laurie's mother, SALLY, 60s but looks in her 40s,
reclines by the POOL. She hears someone VOMITING in her
condo.
SALLY
Laurie? Is that you?
SALLY (V.O.)
Eddie was the Comedian. He always thought
he'd get the last laugh.
As the PRIEST speaks, we move down the row of mourners,
stopping at Dr. Manhattan looking thoughtfully into Blake's
GRAVE
Dr. Manhattan looking down at Blake's grave. We move down to
ADRIAN

Adrian, moving down to Dan as we FADE TO:
A NEWSPAPER BOX. The headlines: "Cops Say: 'Let Them Do It',"
"Senator Keene Proposes Emergency Bill Banning Vigilantism."
PAN UP TO REVEAL: The streets JAMMED with ANGRY PROTESTORS,
waving signs decrying vigilantes.
ANGLE ON: AN OVAL AIRSHIP--the OWL SHIP--its forward windows
sculpted like the eyes of a great owl.

Dan, in costume, pilots the ship. The Comedian stands outside
the ship, in one of the "owl eyes," wielding a MACHINE GUN.
DAN

EVERYONE, PLEASE CLEAR THE STREETS. WE
ARE TRYING TO RETAIN ORDER UNTIL THE
POLICE STRIKE IS OVER.
BLAKE
Crawl back in yer holes before you get
hurt! I got rubber bullets!
MAN IN CROWD
We want regular cops! No more vigilantes!
WOMAN IN CROWD
My son is a cop, asshole!
The Comedian gets HIT IN THE HEAD by a flying SODA CAN.
BLAKE
Okay, that's how you wanna do it?!
Smiling grimly, he FIRES TEAR GAS CANNISTERS INTO THE CROWD.
DAN
Oh God.
(over speakers)
LOOK, I'M SORRY. YOU'VE LEFT US NO
CHOICE. PLEASE CLEAR THE STREETS!
The Comedian DIVES into the crowd, knocking random people
aside with his rifle butt, then starts firing rubber bullets
into the crowd. The protestors scatter and retreat. Dan lands
the Owl Ship, exits wearing a GAS MASK, hands one to Blake.
DAN (CONT'D)
Comedian, this is a nightmare! The whole
city is erupting!
BLAKE
Hah! You seen this?
The smoke clears enough for Dan to see a message SPRAY-
PAINTED on a brick wall: "WHO WATCHES THE WATCHMEN?"
DAN
How long can we keep this up?
BLAKE
My government contacts tell me they're
pushing some new bill through Congress.

Protection from what?
Blake laughs, exultant in the blowing smoke, the chaos.
BLAKE
Are you kidding? From themselves.
CLOSE ON: the happy face pin on Blake's costume. MATCH CUT TO-
--Dan fingering Blake's happy face pin.
PRIEST
Lord have mercy upon us. Amen.
Dan DROPS the pin into Blake's grave. The mourners linger a
moment as dirt is shoveled onto Blake's casket, then start
filing out. We follow one particular mourner all the way in
the back--a LONE MAN, as he walks away.
The Lone Man leaves quickly.
CLOSE ON: Rorschach blasting through the night air as the
city streams by. This close, he appears to be flying.
RORSCHACH (V.0.)
Rorschach's Journal, October 17th.
Thought about Moloch's story on my way to
the cemetery. Could all be lies. A scheme
for revenge planned during his years
behind bars.
CUT WIDE: To reveal he is actually PERCHED ATOP AN ELEVATED
SUBWAY CAR. Just one way he gets around.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
But if it's true, then what? What could
have possibly scared the Comedian? What
building was he talking about? What was
it that he saw? So many questions.
Rorschach stands alone over Blake's fresh grave. Paying his
proper respects.
RORSCHACH (V.0.)
Edward Blake--the Comedian. Born 1944,
buried in the rain. Murdered.
FLASH TO: Blake, the night of his murder, turning as his door
is kicked in.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Violent lives ending violently.
FLASH TO: Adrian's display burning.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Blake understood. Humans are violent in
nature. No matter how much you try to
dress it up, to disguise it.
FLASHES OF: The group photo of the old Watchmen. Then the
photo of the new Watchmen.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Blake saw the true face of human kind and
chose to become a parody of it, treated
it like a joke.

Blake is KICKED in the stomach.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Says he feels all alone in a threatening
world.
Blake stands alone in the blowing tear gas smoke.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Doctor says, "the treatment is simple.
The great clown Pagliacci is in town
tonight. Go and see him. That should pick
you up."
Blake is lifted up by the Intruder's hands.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
The man bursts into tears.
A bloodied Blake laughs at the Intruder.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
"But doctor," he says.
ULTRA-SLOW, Blake crashes through his apartment window.
RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
"I am Pagliacci."
Blake FLIES TOWARD FRAME on his silent trip to the ground.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Good joke. Everybody laugh.
Blake FALLS INTO FRAME--GO BLACK .
Dan and Laurie walk the streets, getting some air.

I hope I didn't ruin your night.

Not at all. I was just going to see
Hollis for our weekly beer session.
You're more than welcome to join. In

They pass the news stand from the opening scene. The Homeless
Man is arguing with the News Vendor:
NEWS VENDOR
--I told you, this month's issue still
hasn't arrived yet! Why do you care about
that right wing rag so much? Cuz those
bastards don't give a damn about you,
pal! They--hold up, here it comes.
They turn as SEYMOUR, a fat slob of a man, arrives with a
BUNDLE of the latest issue of "The New Frontiersman."
CUT TO: Dr. Manhattan stepping THROUGH and INTO the empty,
floating suit. His TIE knots itself.
Dr. Manhattan looks around the empty room . sad? Again,
he looks at the photo of him and Janey Slater . . then
DISAPPEARS IN A BURST OF PARTICLES.
Dan and Laurie turn down a darker, less populated street.
DAN
Laurie, will you please stop apologizing?
I'm here for you anytime.
SHADOWS trail behind them, ominous. Someone's following.
LAURIE
I know. I just find it rude when people
show up at your door--
Dan and Laurie turn down an alley. We now see who's following
them--a group of YOUNG THUGS.
PRODUCER (V.0.)
that's dark enough.
The TV audience materializes out on the roof
Dan and Laurie exit the quiet alley, trying to play it off.
LAURIE
I should find a hotel. God. Imagine, us
getting mugged.
DAN
Why don't you come by Hollis' with me?
Shake off the adrenaline.
LAURIE
No thanks, I've had enough hero stuff for
one night.
(walking away)
You take care, Dan. It's a dangerous
world out there.
Outside Watchmen HQ, Dan's Owl Ship rises out of view.
Rorschach skulks off into the shadows. Dr. Manhattan and
Janey Slater get into a Town Car as young Laurie watches from
around the corner.
BLAKE (O.S.)
Laurel? Laurel Jane?
Startled, Laurie turns. Blake steps out of the shadows.
BLAKE (CONT'D)
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.
LAURIE
You're the Comedian, right? You were
pretty cool in there.
Blake lights a smoke, looks her over.
BLAKE
You got your mom's eyes. Even that funny
little mole.
LAURIE
Got another smoke?

BLAKE
She was one of the all-time champion
beauties, your mom. She talk about me
much?
LAURIE
No. Not really.
As Blake gives her a light, Laurie touches his hand to cover
the lighter from the wind. She looks up at him, sly.
SALLY (O.S.)
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HER.
Laurie nearly jumps out of her skin. A younger Sally marches
toward them from a LIMO, waiting at the sidewalk.
BLAKE
Hey Doll. Long time no see.
SALLY
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
She eyes Laurie with cool death.
SALLY (CONT'D)
Put that out. Get in the car.
INSIDE THE LIMO: Laurie cracks her window an inch. Her
mother's harsh, low tone drifts clearly back.
SALLY (CONT'D)
Are there no depths you won't sink to?
BLAKE
Christ, we were just talking! Can't a guy
talk to his, y'know, friend's daughter?
What the hell do you think I am?
SALLY
I know what you are, Eddie. I've always
known. Don't ever forget that.
Driving off, Laurie watches Blake through the window--
HUGE DISHES scan the skies. We hear the high, clear tone,

FREQUENCIES, the endless, echoing chaff of the world...

But these VOICES get progressively QUIETER, as we--
ZOOM BACK: Up, out of the atmosphere, at a blinding rate--
--landing on A VAST MARTIAN PLAIN, and the tiny BLUE FIGURE,
walking across it, RED DUST BILLOWING behind him. The peace
and quiet after the cacophony of Earth is soothing.
Dr. Manhattan stops, looking over the landscape. He holds the
photo of him and Janey Slater in his hand, when he was human.
He stares at the photo a moment and closes his eyes--
--and we FLASHBACK to the moment that photo was taken. He and
Janey are at a CARNIVAL. After the flash, Janey turns to him.

STRANGE ROCK. It's beautiful--the colors, the crystals--

door, but it's no use--the time lock can't be overridden.
Janey arrives, SCREAMS when she sees Jon inside. Jon turns,

JON OSTERMAN (CONT'D)
Janey? What's wrong?
JANEY SLATER

One of her Colleagues reaches for her hand when STATIC SPARKS

Dan cuts around the UNITED NATIONS BUILDING. The copter
follows the Owl-Ship around to the East River
. but the Owl-Ship is nowhere to be found
The copter hovers there. Baffled.
The Owl-Ship rests at the bottom of the river, hidden
A group of GANG MEMBERS (with the black and yellow bandanas
who confronted Dan on the subway earlier in the film) walks
down the block when another Gang Member catches up, running.

GANG MEMBER 1
Yo, y'all hear? Some super owl dude broke
Rorschach outta prison.
GANG LEADER
Rorschach? That fool put my cousin in a
WHEELCHAIR
GANG MEMBER 2
You say Nite Owl broke him out? Didn't he
write a book or something? He lives over
a garage near here.
GANG LEADER
Does he now
The Owl-Ship BURSTS THROUGH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
DAN (V.0.)
Let's really start plumbing the depths.
Jon leads Laurie into the Glass Palace.

DR. MANHATTAN
Our conversation commences when you
surprise me with the information that you
and Dreiberg have been sleeping together.
LAURIE
You . know about me and Dan?
DR. MANHATTAN
Not yet. But in a few moments, you're
going to tell me.
LAURIE
Jon, I'm having enough problems right now
without getting into your predestination
crap.
DR. MANHATTAN
Why does my perception of time distress
you so?
LAURIE
Because. If you already know the future,
why were you surprised when I left you,
or when that reporter ambushed you? Why
even debate if you already know the
outcome?
DR. MANHATTAN
Because everything is pre-ordained. Even
my responses.
LAURIE
Agh! This is so typical of you! Do you
know what a relief it is to be with
somebody human, like Dan?
DR. MANHATTAN
You mean you're sleeping with Dan
Dreiberg?
Contemplating this, he steps to the balcony's edge.
LAURIE
But you already know . You said--
DR. MANHATTAN
I said, often, that you were my only
remaining link with the world. Now that
link is shattered. Don't you see the
futility of asking me to save a world
that I no longer have any stake in?
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED: (2)
LAURIE
That's ridiculous. The Earth is too
important to hinge on one relationship.
DR. MANHATTAN
Not to me. My red world here means more
to me than your blue one. I'll show you
around if you like.
The giant Glass Palace begins to RUMBLE.
LAURIE
Are you doing this? I'm not in the mood
for jokes.
DR. MANHATTAN
Nor I. Believe me, I fully understand the
gravity of the situation.
The clockwork Glass Palace RISES HIGH INTO THE AIR
The Owl-Ship approaches the large warehouse building that is
Pyramid Industries. The ship lands in the alley nearby.
Dan and Rorschach exit the ship. Shady neighborhood.
Rorschach goes to the door which is AJAR
The endless white blanket that is Antarctica is interrupted
by a SPLASH OF COLOR in the distance. As we approach, we see
that the color is a BIO-DOME--a tropical RAINFOREST inside.
This is part of KARNAK: Adrian Veidt's Arctic Fortress.
In the alley, the Gang Members who killed Hollis Mason stand
around the Owl-Ship arguing amongst themselves, when Dan
appears behind them.
DAN
Something I can help you with, boys?
They all spin around, frightened at the costume.
GANG MEMBER 1
(to Gang Leader)
I told you we had the wrong guy.
The Gang Leader shits his pants as Dan steps closer.
GANG LEADER
L-listen, I didn't mean to kill that old
guy. Things just got outta hand
DAN
What old guy?
Hearing SCREAMS outside, Rorschach bursts out of the
WAREHOUSE--
(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:
--and sees Dan gripping the bloody Gang Leader by the THROAT,
CHOKING him as the other Gang Members flee.
DAN
You're dead! You and the rest of your
gang, you're all DEAD! You know how much
fire-power I've got floating out there!?
Oh god damn. Hollis. God damn god damn
god damn
Dan begins to break up. Rorschach quietly pulls him away.
RORSCHACH
Not now, Daniel.
The Owl-Ship slows to a hover besides an OLDER BUILDING.
RORSCHACH (V.0.)
Rorschach's Journal. Final entry?
Dreiberg is convinced that Veidt is
behind everything. Apparently, the Owl-
Ship is capable of the trip to
Antarctica, but are we? I cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent. Veldt is
faster than Dreiberg and myself. He used
to joke that he was fast enough to catch
a bullet. I believe he could. He could
kill us both, alone in' the snow. No one
would know.
Rorschach descends the ladder, goes to the door of the
building. He places his JOURNAL in an ENVELOPE.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I have done my best to make this legible.
Whether I am alive or dead upon this
reading, know that whatever the nature of
this conspiracy--Adrian Veldt is
responsible.
He drops the envelope into the MAIL SLOT, climbs back up the
ladder.
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I appreciate your recent support and hope
the world survives long enough for this
to reach you. For my own part, I regret
nothing. I have lived my life free of
compromise, and step now into the shadow
without complaint. Rorschach. October
21st.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
Rorschach disappears into the dark hatch. The Owl-Ship blasts
off . disappearing, just as Seymour arrives. Seymour
picks up the mail and walks inside.
Laurie's hair blows in the cold wind. She lowers her head.
Jon serves her some WATER.
LAURIE
Can't you just tell me how this all ends
and save us the trouble?
DR. MANHATTAN
It ends with you in tears.
LAURIE
Tears. You mean I lose? You don't come
back to Earth?
DR. MANHATTAN
I return to Earth at some point. The
streets are filled with death.
LAURIE
You mean there's going to be a war? An
actual, nuclear war?
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
DR. MANHATTAN
I can't be sure. I'm still experiencing
some static interference preventing any
clear vision of what lies ahead.
LAURIE
Static?
DR. MANHATTAN
Tachyon particles. Tachyons are a rare
occurrence. The detonation of nuclear
warheads could conceivably be the cause.
LAURIE
Jon, you've got to stop it! Everyone will
die!
DR. MANHATTAN
And the universe will not even notice.
See the dual moons. Aren't they
breathtaking?
Above, TWO MOONS cross overhead. One is HUGE, CRIMSON RED,
the smaller is a delicate SHELL PINK. Spectacular.
LAURIE
You're right, Jon--what does human life
matter next to a, a neutrino. Look, I'm
not going to debate you when you clearly
don't see anything terribly miraculous
about life. I guess quantum physics
doesn't allow for miracles.
DR. MANHATTAN
No, thermodynamic miracles are--
LAURIE
Oh God, Jon. Land this thing. Now.
DR. MANHATTAN
On the Argyre Planitia? As you wish.
The structure descends. Laurie stomps down the stairs.
LAURIE
That's it then. You can send me back to
Earth to fry with Dan and my Mom and all
the other worthless humans. And look, you
were wrong. You said this ended with me
in tears and see? Not a damp eye in the
house. Maybe you're wrong about
everything.
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED: (2)
Jon is waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs.
DR. MANHATTAN
Laurie. You complain that I refuse to see
life on life's terms. And yet you
continuously refuse to see things from my
perspective. If only you'd try to see the
whole continuum, life's pattern, you'd
understand. But you deliberately shut it
out as if afraid to see.
LAURIE
I'm not afraid, okay? You want me to see
things your way? Go ahead, do that thing
you do.
She stands there, arms folded, waiting. Then, just like
earlier in the lab, Jon touches her head--
The owl-Ship sails through a TOWERING CLOUD BANK. The COAST
approaches as SNOW starts to fall.
The ship, tiny before the massive ice-wall, climbs slowly.
It's going to be close. The wall is 100 yards away now, the
top-most edge barely in view. 50 yards. 20 and then
SILENCE--
DAN
We just lost the engines--find something
to grab on to!
The ship BARELY CLEARS THE CLIFF. BOUNCING hard, it SKIPS
across the snow like a stone, finally CRASHING INTO A DRIFT.
Rorschach pulls up his trench-collar against the bitter wind.
Dan pulls two stand-up HOVER-SCOOTERS from an OUTSIDE HATCH.
They exchange a look and ride the scooters off into the snow.
105.
Flying on the scooter, Dan wipes frost and fog from his
goggles. He then looks up and--
--sees KARNAK, a GARGANTUAN GLASS PYRAMID, rising out of the
snow, the Bio-Dome attached to it.
A BEAM of BLUE ENERGY SHOOTS INTO THE SKY from Karnak. The
energy infects the CLOUDS, CHARGED with CRASHING, ERRATIC
BLUE LIGHTNING SPREADING out across the globe
As the News vendor opens his stand--
DR. MANHATTAN (V.0.)
PEOPLE OF THE WORLD...
110.
We're with the Pakistani and Indian Soldiers from earlier,
stopping their gun fight to look up at the sky--
DR. MANHATTAN (V.0.)
(in Hindi)
THIS ENDS TONIGHT.
We're with the Chinese Battleships from earlier--
DR. MANHATTAN (V.0.)
(in Mandarin)
FROM THIS MINUTE ON, YOU SHALL CHANGE
YOUR POLICIES AND YOUR WAYS OF VIOLENCE-
Realization is dawning on the faces of the New Yorkers.
DR. MANHATTAN (V.0.)
FROM THIS MINUTE ON--I WILL BE WATCHING.
Suddenly the SOUND of a rising, HOWLING WIND and the
LIGHTNING STRIKES begin, CRASHING TO EARTH with savage,
blistering force. Their expended blue energy SPREADS like
LIQUID FIRE, FLOODING THROUGH THE STREETS.
People SCREAM and RUN. As the LIGHT OVERTAKES the unlucky
ones, they are instantly BLOWN TO ASH--
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
(WORLD MONTAGE): --as is the News Vendor; the Pakistani and
Indian Soldiers; the Chinese Battleships; the Israeli Missile
Control Room; Paris; the Great Wall of China. Destroyed.
The smoke-filled street is silent. Then GLOWING PARTICLES
COALESCE, slamming together to form Jon and Laurie, but Jon's
teleportation falters, shorting out. They FALL from the air.
Laurie drops roughly to her knees.
LAURIE
God Jon, what was that?
Jon looks around the street. Even he is awe-struck.
DR. MANHATTAN
Interference. Cataclysmic interference.
Laurie looks up and screams. THOUSANDS OF BLACK SILHOUETTES
are IMPRINTED on the STREET and the WALLS. Everywhere. There
is no rubble--some buildings have simply disintegrated.
LAURIE
Was it a war? It doesn't seem like--
DR. MANHATTAN
Not a war. I .don't know what it was.
Dr. Manhattan looks up into the sky, studying it.
LAURIE
Take me out of here, Jon. Please.
DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry. This must be very upsetting
for you. I have traced the source of the
Tachyon particles to Antarctica. Shall
we?
LAURIE
Anywhere. Anywhere's better than here.
Laurie vomits in the snow.
DR. MANHATTAN
Adrian, of course. Who else would have
the resources
LAURIE
Wait, this is Adrian's compound? Are you
saying he's responsible for this--
Jon walks toward the building, entranced. Distracted.
DR. MANHATTAN
Yes. Yes, he killed Blake and millions of
others. Excuse me, Daniel, I'm talking to
Laurie ninety seconds ago
LAURIE
What, Daniel? Millions of others? Jon
don't start that crap now, not here!
(CONTINUED)
113.
CONTINUED:
DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry. It's these tachyons. They're,
muddling things up. I'd better follow him
INSIDE
In a burst, he's gone.
The Owl-Ship RISES into the sky, the Pyramid of Karnak
BLAZING from it's tip like a Roman candle. Dan watches out
the window, until his eyes slip shut
Time has passed. The disintegrated buildings are being
rebuilt. The shock of the attack is wearing off, and though
the streets may not be as crowded as they once were, a sense
of normalcy is returning.
Sally Jupiter walks the sidewalk, looking for an address.
