LT
If you think you're not getting on
this bus, you're dead wrong. No
fucking way are you gonna miss this
bus, man! You were probably the kind
of kids who had your father drive
you to school cause you couldn't
catch the fucking bus. But no more,
man. You're getting on this bus and
you're taking it to the last fucking
stop. So get on the fucking bus,
man, 'cause you're life ain't worth
shit in this town.
LT uncuffs them and the KIDS get on the BUS, dumbstruck.
LT hands JULIO the CIGAR BOX. His "salvation."
The KIDS don't even know what is inside. They take it.
LT gets back into his CAR, takes off.
CUT TO:
EXT/INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR - AT 33RD STREET & 8TH AVENUE -
AT THE RENDEZ-VOUS WITH THE BOOKIE
EXT: LT PULLS UP AT THE APPOINTED SPOT. HE AWAITS THE
ARRIVAL OF THE BOOKIE.
INT: STRAWBERRY is up. The GAME can go either way. Suspense.
But not on the face of LT. He is dressed in the PURPLE ROBES,
the CHALICE beside him in the CAR.
The BOOKIE pulls up and -- without getting out of his CAR --
He SHOOTS LT in the head.
The BOOKIE speeds off. (We never saw him behind the dark
windows,} LT is dead in his CAR.
On the RADIO, the GAME is ending. STRAWBERRY hits a HOME RUN
and the -- Mets win, the CROWD ROARS.
